BRUSSELS â€” President Barack Obama paid tribute to soldiers who died in World War I on Wednesday. Obama laid a wreath at Flanders Field American Cemetery, noting that the war still echoes in conflicts 100 years later.

"The lessons of that war speak to us still," Obama said. His visit to Flanders Field was his first stop since arriving in Belgium late Tuesday.

The president is in Brussels for a summit with European Union leaders. He is also scheduled to meet with the leader of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and deliver a speech. NATO is a military partnership among countries who agree to defend one another from threats.

Talk of a new threat on Europe's doorstep is expected to be the focus of Obama's European trip this week. Obama and European leaders are to discuss Russia's armed takeover of the Crimean peninsula in Ukraine. Obama and Western European countries are trying to prevent Russia from moving farther into Ukraine.

## Europe On Edge

Ukraine was once part of the Soviet Union, a group of republics controlled by Russia. Ukraine gained its independence when the Soviet Union broke up in 1991. Ukraine's region of Crimea has many Russians in it. Russia invaded Crimea in early March and is claiming it as part of Russia.

On Tuesday, Obama repeated threats of more painful economic sanctions, or punishments, against Russia. If Russian President Vladimir Putin sends troops into other regions of Ukraine, Obama has warned Russia that the United States might hit it with sanctions. These penalties would hurt Russia's ability to trade with other countries. Russian businesses would suffer. But the president also acknowledged that, for now, Crimea is likely to remain in Russian control. It's not expected that the Russians will be removed "by force," he said.

Still, Russia's neighbors are looking for assurance that NATO will make good on its obligations to defend them. But other European nations are worried that tougher sanctions against Russia would hurt their own businesses and trade.

Obama's remarks later Wednesday were expected to address such concerns. At the same time, he wants to avoid angry speeches between the U.S. and Russia, officials have said. These were common during the Cold War era, when the United States and the Soviet Union were enemies.

The president's visit comes 100 years after the outbreak of World War I. The anniversary of the war that engulfed much of Europe is widely remembered here. More than 1,000 Americans were killed in Belgium in World War I. Nearly 400 of them are honored at the grassy, 6-acre battlefield at Flanders.

## Reading From A Poem

The ceremony was held at the cemetery west of Brussels, the capital of Belgium. Obama, Belgian King Philippe and Belgian Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo placed wreaths at a monument built to honor the missing dead. In remarks afterward, all three leaders spoke of lessons from the war that apply today.

"Our countries have learned the hard way" that countries can easily lose their ability to defend themselves when met with heavily armed enemies, the king said. He noted that his great-grandfather, King Albert, fought in the war. World War I is also called The Great War, and The War To End All Wars.

Di Rupo warned that "those who ignore the past are taking the risk to relive it."

Obama noted that chemical weapons were used to "devastating effect" on Flanders Field. He emphasized that today, in Syria and elsewhere, the world still struggles to put an end to their use.

"We thought we had banished their use to history, and our efforts send a powerful message that these weapons have no place in a civilized world. This is one of the ways that we can honor those who fell here," Obama said. "This visit," he said, shows that "we must never, ever take our progress for granted."

The president also read from the poem "In Flanders Fields" that famously memorialized the fighting at Flanders. Written by John McCrae, a Canadian army doctor, the verse called on the history lesson of the war to be handed down:

_To you from failing hands we throw_ _The torch; be yours to hold it high_ _If ye break faith with us who die_ _We shall not sleep, though poppies grow_ _In Flanders fields_.
