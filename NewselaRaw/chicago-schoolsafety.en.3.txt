CHICAGO â€” Chicago children returned to school Tuesday protected by 1,300 guards.

Last year, the city placed 1,200 guards in crime-filled neighborhoods.

Thanks to $1 million from the city this year, another 100 "Safe Passage" workers lined routes that students walk to get to school. Illinois' governor pledged $10 million, so another 600 workers will be hired over the next several weeks.

Jadine Chou is the chief safety and security officer for the Chicago Public Schools. She said more workers will be watching out along the routes. The city will place them farther from schools to protect kids walking greater distances. The district has added Safe Passage workers to 27 schools. Now, 120 city schools have the guards.

"It was good last year, but I don't think it stopped the violence none," said Tiffany Davis. She was walking her 7-year-old son to Dulles School of Excellence on the city's South Side. "Maybe it calmed things down a little."

## Closing Some Schools Made People Fearful

The media did not pay that much attention to the first day of school. Last year, there was a big fuss after Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel ordered nearly 50 schools to be closed. Parents and others were very upset. They worried that children could get caught in gang fights while walking through dangerous neighborhoods to new schools.

But their worst fears never happened.

"It didn't happen, to the glory of God, and I think (very little) if anything, happened to children on their way to and from school," said Bishop Larry Trotter. He is the minister of Sweet Holy Spirit Church on the city's South Side. Trotter and several other ministers urged Emanuel to keep the schools open. "The mayor and his team did a wonderful job."

No student was badly hurt along a guarded Safe Passage route.

## Bursts Of Violence

Since school ended, the city has witnessed bursts of violence. Many people have been killed and injured in gun attacks.

Some worry that the city is not doing enough to keep students safe. High school students may be at special risk. Many of them belong to clubs or sports teams that meet outside of regular school hours. They may have to walk early in the morning or later in the afternoon when the guards are not there.

Last December, a 15-year-old girl who left her home before dawn to get to school was attacked. She was less than a half block from a Safe Passage route.

"She had to get to school earlier than the Safe Passage (workers) were on duty," said state Representative LaShawn Ford. Safe Passage workers were not on the street at 6 a.m. Ford wants the guards to be on the streets longer. Guards start less than an hour before classes begin. They leave about an hour after school ends, according to Chicago Public Schools.

## Keeping An Eye On Violence

There is also a political problem for Mayor Rahm Emanuel. The mayor can run for re-election next year. Chicago Teachers Union President Karen Lewis is one of his possible rivals. Lewis has criticized Emanuel for closing neighborhood schools. She has called him the "murder mayor" because of the city's violence.

If there is any violence to students walking to or from school, his rivals may use the issue to turn people against Emanuel. He is not as popular as he was last year.
