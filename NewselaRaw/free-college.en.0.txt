Imagine a city where one-third of the children live in poverty and one-tenth of the adults cannot find a job. Imagine a place where barely six of 10 students even finish high school.

That city was New Haven, Connecticut, just a few years ago, according to U.S. Census data and reports by the National Student Clearinghouse. Too many New Haven youths looked to their future and saw nothing but a wall of obstacles. For them, there was no path to success and no world of possibilities to explore. This was an especially bitter reality since New Haven is home to Yale University, one of the world's most prestigious learning institutions.

## A Radical Plan

Things began to change when New Haven's mayor, school superintendent and other city leaders crafted a plan to give college scholarships for qualifying high school graduates. The program, New Haven Promise, has helped lift New Haven's graduation rate.  This year, seven out of 10 high school students are on track to get their diplomas.

New Haven's plan is radical, but it is not unique. The program is modeled after Kalamazoo Promise in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Once it is fully phased in, the Promise will cover full tuition to Connecticut public colleges and universities for students who meet the program's requirements. It will cover partial tuition for private universities in Connecticut. All New Haven students, even those from the poorest families, now have a chance to go to college if they make the grade. Yale University is funding the program.

## City In Search Of A Makeover

Like so many cities in the Northeast and Midwest, New Haven has suffered from a range of economic woes. Factories have closed and their low-skill manufacturing jobs are long gone. The new companies in town require workers with a college degree or advanced training. Middle class residents live mostly in the outlying suburbs. The inner-city school district serves the majority of the region's low-income and minority students. There's a vast difference in achievement between the suburban schools and the inner-city schools.  In fact, of all 50 states, Connecticut has the widest gap in achievement between its highest-performing and lowest-performing schools.

The New Haven Promise is part of a bigger plan to improve the city's economy. New Haven is trying to turn itself into a biotechnology research and development mecca. City leaders want to attract high-tech businesses and the workers they require. But the turnaround will take more than just new companies moving to town; New Haven needs to invest in educating its youth so they will be qualified to do those high-skilled jobs when they become adults.

## A Two-Way Promise

The New Haven Promise is no one-way street.  Although the scholarship is available to all students, they must sign a pledge to "do their best" in certain vital areas of achievement.  To earn the scholarship, students must not only live in New Haven and attend New Haven public schools, but also earn a minimum 3.0 grade point average (GPA) upon graduation, maintain a 90 percent attendance record, and have a good disciplinary record. Students must also complete 40 hours of community service at a community organization.

During the few years these Promise programs have been in place, it has has become clear that providing free tuition is not enough. Getting disadvantaged students on the road to success takes more than money. Many students lack role models for success or sufficient encouragement at home.

## Teaching Success

School officials are realizing they must develop a mindset of success, rather than failure, in even the youngest students. In New Haven, there is a new plan called College Summit. The goal is to create an expectation that all students can and will attend college. Raising students' expectations must start well before high school. Students need the confidence, commitment and good study habits to envision themselves in college, doing college-level work.

High schools are now providing college readiness courses for their students. New Haven Promise is offering workshops for parents on how to make sense of the college application process, which can be confusing. New Haven has pledged to have all students reading proficiently by the end of third grade, putting them on track for college readiness by high school.

## Not Just Getting In, But Staying In

The Promise program will be considered a success if students are able to do well enough in college to finish with a 2-year or 4-year degree.  Educators are tracking students who enter college on a Promise scholarship and finding that many do not enroll for a second year after finishing the first. Many are unable to keep up the minimum grade average. The ability to not just start college, but stay with it is called "college persistence."

Middle-class students on the Promise Scholarships tend to do better than their lower-income peers. That goes to show that there are big barriers to achieving success, even when there is money pointed at the problem. For example, in Kalamazoo, the success rate for middle-income students was about twice that for poor students, with the low-income students either losing their scholarships or being put on probation. In New Haven, it may be too soon to tell, but the hope is that the new culture of success will make the difference in the years to come.
