WASHINGTON â€” Gay couples can now marry across the country. Gay marriage is when a man marries a man or a woman marries a woman.

The U.S. Supreme Court announced its decision Friday. The court gave America its most important new freedom in years.

The Supreme Court is the highest court in the United States. It has nine judges, called justices. They make sure laws agree with the Constitution. Their decisions cannot be challenged.

## People Get To Marry Whom They Want

Before Friday's ruling, 37 states allowed gay marriage. Thirteen states outlawed it.

The court's decision was cheered by many people. They said it recognizes the right of people to marry who they want. Others blasted the decision. They said the justices should have left gay marriage alone. They said each state should be able to make its own law about it.

Justice Anthony M. Kennedy explained the court's decision. He wrote about the importance of marriage. He said it represents love, loyalty and family.

He wrote that gay couples "ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right."

The decision will mean more people will likely accept gay marriage. Most Americans now support it. This was not the case just a few years ago.

Kennedy said that some places still might not treat gay people fairly.

## It Was A Narrow Vote

The justices voted 5 to 4 to allow gay marriage.

Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. voted against it. He said the Constitution does not deal with marriage. Roberts said that each state should decide on gay marriage.

Many supporters of gay marriage celebrated on the steps of the Supreme Court building. James Obergefell was one of them. Obergefell brought the case to the Supreme Court. He had challenged the state of Ohio after it did not recognize his marriage to a man. If people disagree with a lower court, they can take it to a higher court, like the Supreme Court.

President Barack Obama called Obergefell to congratulate him.

Obama applauded the decision. He called it a "victory for America."

Allowing gay couples to marry is important. It makes communities stronger, the president said.

Obama said the decision declares what millions of Americans believe in their hearts. He said that "when all Americans are treated as equal, all are free."

## Court's Ruling Sends A Clear Message

Two years ago, the Supreme Court made an important statement. It said gay marriages deserved equal dignity and respect under the law. The decision on Friday took that a step further.

Friday's decision could have many effects. It may send a message that laws cannot be made against gay people for any reason.

Sarah Warbelow is a lawyer for the Human Rights Campaign. The group is in Washington, D.C. She said lawmakers in different states are trying to pass 115 laws against gay people. The court's decision will help fight them, she said.

Warbelow and others wanted Justice Kennedy to make a stronger statement. They wanted him to say that treating gay people unfairly is wrong. They say treating gay people badly is as bad as treating black people or women unfairly.

She said that Kennedy should have made it clear to people. Then the government would know it cannot make laws against gay people.
