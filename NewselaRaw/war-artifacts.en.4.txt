KANSAS CITY, Mo. â€” A Kansas City meadow was the scene of a fierce Civil War battle 150 years ago. Then around 60 years ago, construction crews began building on top of the meadow. Soon, a man began showing up with a metal detector.

The man was John Adams Jr. He was worried that valuable pieces of history might be lost forever. Between 1952 and 1963, he dug up dozens of objects from the meadow. They had been left there during the battle.

It is known as the Battle of Westport and it took place in October 1864. It was Kansas City's most important Civil War battle.

Adams found many things, including belt buckles, guns and bullets.

## His Valuable Collection

Adams often showed up after heavy rains. He thought the rain might uncover buried objects. Whenever new construction began, he asked if he could look around.

Today, many are thankful for what Adams did. Because of him, a valuable collection of objects exists.

Visitors to the Battle of Westport Museum can see the objects Adams saved. About 75 are being shown. The area he took them from is now known as the Byram's Ford Big Blue Battlefield.

Adams held onto his Civil War finds for many years. Then he grew sick, so in 2012 he sold them to collector Mike George for just $400. Adams died soon after that.

George didn't really know much about what he had gotten. At first he didn't even want to buy them.

"To me it was just a bunch of rusted things," George said. "He said, 'I want somebody who will appreciate it and not sell it.' He was a good friend," George said. "Finally I said, 'John, I'll do it, but only because it is you.'"

## Where 29,000 Soldiers Fought

The Battle of Westport was fought between the Union North and the Confederate South. Fighting lasted for three days and in the end, the Union won.

The battle was the biggest to take place west of the Mississippi River during the entire war. Around 29,000 soldiers fought in it.

Earlier this year, George decided to show people some of Adams' objects at a museum.

George realized he needed more information first. He got in touch with Daniel Smith, an expert on the battle.

Smith decided to take a look at what George had. He wasn't expecting much.

All that changed when George mentioned his friend, Adams. Smith had studied the Adams family for years.

## A Gun Found In A Barn

In 1853, the Adams family bought land in the area. The large property stood near a river crossing known as Byram's Ford.

Then the war arrived. The Adams family had to flee. It did not return to the Byram's Ford property until 1870. While they were gone, fighting took place on their land.

George showed Smith two shells. They were the type fired by guns used by some Union soldiers.

Smith had a copy of the same type of shell. But here were two real examples. Both were still whole because they had not exploded. Smith was amazed.

George then showed him a gun that may have belonged to a Confederate soldier. It had been found in a barn on the land owned by Adams family.

Adams continued searching for Civil War objects for many years, but he found less in later years. By then, more of the meadow had been covered over with concrete.

His work paid off, though. Today, the Adams collection helps connect us to Kansas City's most important Civil War battle.
