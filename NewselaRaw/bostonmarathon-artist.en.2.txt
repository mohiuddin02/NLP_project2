BOSTON — Hope Phelan is a competitive distance runner with a new goal. Phelan wants to use her skills as an artist to recapture the joy of the Boston Marathon. She has created a series of paintings that celebrate the annual event — and deliberately ignore the deadly bombings that ruined the 2013 race.

"Wellesley Scream Tunnel" depicts the women of Wellesley College encouraging athletes as they pass. ''Heartbreak Hill" captures triumphant runners as they conquer the toughest section of the race. "The Home Stretch" shows competitors passing Boston's famous Citgo sign as they near the finish line.

"I was trying to bring it back to the way I remember it," said Phelan, 26, a professional painter and art teacher who grew up south of Boston and visited every April to watch the race. "I wanted to bring the fun back."

## Turning The Memories Around

On April 15, 2013, Phelan had finished her first Boston Marathon in just over three hours. She was a few blocks away celebrating when she heard the explosions and saw people running and screaming.

To help her deal with those difficult memories, Phelan made a dark, serious painting she titled simply "Boston Marathon 2013." She threw splashes of red paint at it to imitate the blood on the street that day. "It was really emotional and expressive," she said.

On the first anniversary of the bombings, Phelan was inspired to raise money for the people hurt in the attack. She created pieces that looked quite different from her first marathon painting. They were bright, colorful depictions of athletes and spectators interacting along the famous 26.2-mile course that ends in Boston.

One playful piece, "The Finish Line," was painted on one of the foil blankets finishers are given to keep warm. The backdrop for another is a collage of Phelan's race bib numbers.

## Simple Goal Of Racing

Phelan's paintings are sold under the name she had before she got married, Hope Rathnam, on a website called Etsy.com. The Boston Marathon paintings are also being featured at Marathon Sports, a running shop along the Brookline, Massachusetts, section of the race route. They will be on display there through the April 20 running of this year's race.

Two years after bombs killed three people who were watching the race and wounded more than 260, Phelan's art reflects the running community's desire to restore America's most beloved marathon. Runners want to go back to the simple goal the race's founders had in mind 119 years ago: an amateur footrace to see who is the fastest.

## Springtime In Boston

Tom Derderian, a Greater Boston Track Club coach and author of "The Boston Marathon: A Celebration of the World's Premier Race," says the race is an important part of springtime in Boston. He describes the massive event as a "celebration," pointing out that it takes place, "at that time of year when there is hope again."

Derderian is also involved in the making of a new documentary film about the annual marathon. He says that, eventually, the bombing will just be one horrible incident in the history of the race.

"A terrible crime was committed," he said. "But as the years go by, the Boston Marathon will be more and more of a footrace and less and less of a crime scene."

## "The City Is So Determined"

Phelan wants to help bring the race "back to normal." She hopes her art will encourage others to re-embrace its people and pageantry.

"The Boston Marathon is like a parade. People are screaming and it's loud and there's water being thrown at you," she said.

Caitlin Marquis is a Boston-based researcher, runner and a fan of Phelan's paintings. She says Phelan's personal connection to her work is what makes it so special. "There is so much joy that leaks into the paintings that couldn't get there any other way except for her love of running," she said.

"The city is so determined to recapture the race, and these paintings are definitely in keeping with that joy," Marquis said.
