BEIJING â€” The search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is almost over. A yellow submarine will be used in a last attempt to find it. The plane disappeared while flying between the Asian countries of Malaysia and China.

Investigators looking for the vanished Boeing 777 have put away their pinger locating tool. They are about to call off searches on the ocean surface. They are sending the small robotic sub underwater. It will scan the ocean in an area bigger than the city of Los Angeles.

The submarine is called a "Bluefin-21" underwater robotic vehicle. Australian technicians were planning to send it into the Indian Ocean Monday afternoon. It will travel 2.8 miles down to the seabed. Its side-scanning sonar will look for any sign of the plane.

"It is time to go underwater," Australian Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston said. He is coordinating the search from Perth, Australia.

Unless the robot submarine gets lucky, the search could take a while. The U.S. Navy said mapping the area where the plane most likely disappeared could take six weeks to two months. The Navy lent the Bluefin-21 to the search team.

## Robot Sub Works Slowly

The 16-foot, 1,650-pound sub moves about as fast as a person walking. It will be searching an area of about 600 square miles. Houston said the first day's work would cover about 15 square miles.

These searches "can take quite a bit of time" said David Kelly. He is president of Bluefin Robotics, the Massachusetts company that makes the submarine.

The Bluefin-21 works on a 24-hour cycle. It takes two hours each way to get to the seafloor and back. It can search underwater for 16 hours. Once it gets back to the surface, it takes four hours to download the information it gathered. Then it has to get ready for its next dive.

It floats in pitch-black water about 150 feet off the sea floor. It scans a half-mile of the seabed below. The Bluefin-21 uses sonar to gather information that will make a high-resolution 3-D map.

If it seems to catch something, the sonar can be swapped out for high-definition cameras. When the cameras are on, the sub hovers just 15 feet off the seafloor. It takes a series of overlapping pictures. Then those pictures get combined to make one big detailed picture.

## Sub Below, Crew Above

Search crews on the boats will have no idea whether it has found anything while underwater. It sends back basic information such as depth and power remaining. But Kelly said the connection is not good.

"You give it a track and it goes," said Charitha Pattiaratchi. He is an oceanographer. The sub doesn't send the crew "anything while it's down there."

The plane vanished March 8 with 239 people aboard. The searchers 1,300 miles off the western coast of Australia waited 38 days to send out the submarine. They were hoping to make the search area smaller. They thought they could use signals from the plane's two black boxes.

On four occasions, a pinger locator towed by the Ocean Shield picked up signals. Investigators strongly suspect they were from one or both of the black boxes from the plane. But there have been no new signals in the last six days. The batteries on those devices are only supposed to last 30 days.

## Ending The Surface Search

The search for clues on the ocean surface hasn't been successful so far, either. Houston said that it would probably be called off in the next two to three days. The lookouts scanning the waters from the air and from ships would return home.

"The chances of any floating material being recovered" have fallen, Houston said. "Australia and its partners (will have) to decide the way ahead later this week."

It's a "tough call to make," Van Gurley said. He is a retired U.S. Navy captain and works at Metron Inc. Metron helped find Air France Flight 447 after it crashed in the Atlantic Ocean in 2009.

"It sounds like Angus Houston said some words to prepare everybody. They're going to, in a couple days, shut down all the air and surface" searching, he added.
