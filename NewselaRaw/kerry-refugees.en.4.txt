BERLIN, Germany â€” Refugees leave their country to escape war and other terrible problems. They hope to find a new place to live.

Now many more refugees can move to the United States. Secretary of State John Kerry announced the change on Sunday. Kerry is in charge of U.S. relations with other countries.

Most of the refugees the United States will let in are from Syria. A terrible war has been happening there. It has been going on for five years.

## Fighting In Syria Is Getting Worse

Syrian fighters are trying to get rid of Syria's president, Bashar Assad. The United States would also like to see Assad gone. It is supporting some of the fighters.

Next year, the United States will let in around 10,000 new Syrian refugees. In 2017 it will let in even more.

Things inside Syria have been getting much worse. Around 9 million people have left their homes. More than 4 million have left the country. They no longer feel safe.

On Sunday Kerry met with several Syrian refugees. They said more and more people are leaving Syria. Many are losing hope that things will ever get better. The war is getting worse and worse.

One Syrian woman said she came to Germany with her 5-year-old daughter. She said her two other children were still in Syria. She hopes they can leave, too.

## Lawmakers Worry Fighters Might Sneak In

Not everyone is happy so many new Syrian refugees are coming to the U.S. Some lawmakers are worried. They say fighters could slip in with the real refugees. Those fighters could try to attack the United States.

Kerry and others say there is no reason to worry. The new refugees will be checked very carefully.

So far the United States has taken in only 1,500 Syrians since the war began. Germany has taken in far more than that.

Hillary Rodham Clinton said the U.S. "has to do more." Clinton is now running for president. She was secretary of state before Kerry.

Clinton said letting in 10,000 Syrian refugees was "a good start." She added that she hopes many more will be let in.

Kerry said there is only one way to fix the Syrian refugee problem. Syria's war has to end. Before that can happen, Assad will have to stop being president, he said.
