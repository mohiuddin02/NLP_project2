IRVINE, Calif. — Janice Stanley seems excited as the group stares carefully — but quietly — at her.

Stanley is a nurse at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center. She uses technology to train doctors, nurses, and X-ray operators. 

Today's group are not health experts, but they could be someday.

"Hi, guys," the cheery Stanley says.

Instantly, she corrects herself.

"Hi, girls!"

Stanley is teaching 14 Girl Scouts ages 11 to 14. They are at Kaiser to earn the new My STEM Life badge. The badge is special to Orange County, California, where they live. 

## Shrinking The Gender Gap

The Girl Scouts are working with businesses to shrink the "gender gap." The gender gap is an imbalance between men and women. Many more men than women work in science, technology, engineering and math. These are known as STEM jobs. Three-fifths of Orange County jobs are in STEM.

Research shows that by middle school, most girls turn away from STEM subjects. Their decision limits their careers and expands the gender gap.

Paula Golden is president of Broadcom. The technology company is partnered with the Girl Scouts. Golden believes that without more women in STEM, half the population will be left out of the most exciting jobs of the 21st century. 

"The way women work, think and innovate is traditionally very different from that of young men," Golden explains. 

About one-fifth, or 4,000, of Orange County's Girl Scouts can earn the STEM badge. 

## STEM Jobs Pay Well

Stanley points out key gender gap facts to her group of girls: Half the nation's workers are women, but they fill only one-quarter of STEM jobs. Meanwhile, women in STEM jobs earn one-third more money.

"We could actually be having fun, making more money and doing better for ourselves and our families," Stanley explains.

It is not just girls and women who benefit from STEM careers. Educators and business leaders view STEM learning as essential to improving technology and the wealth of the United States.

Companies that support the STEM badge donated at least $10,000 to develop its teaching program.

They want girls to know STEM education is used for jobs with special training, and also how it relates to things they do every day, like making music playlists and sandcastles.

## From Medical Care To Monitoring Fish Populations

The girls taught by Stanley learned elementary medical care with Kaiser's "SimMan 3G" robot. They wore germ-free gloves and stethoscopes to check his signs, and to deliver chest compressions and shock treatment.

On the technology end, they changed SimMan's breathing, turning his lips blue. They also made the mannequin say, "Doc, I feel like I could die," and, "Go away."

Girl Scouts also take an ocean trip to monitor fish populations and collect samples for the Crystal Cove Alliance environmental group. 

## Keeping Girls Engaged

In 2012, Girl Scouts of the USA published "Generation STEM: What Girls Say about Science, Technology, Engineering and Math."

The report found that a promising three-fourths of high school girls were interested in STEM. However, it also noted that gender problems "are still high for girls."

Last year, educators asked Girl Scouts how schools could keep girls engaged in STEM learning. One answered, "Make sure teachers know our first names, too, and not just the boys' first names."

## Boys Still Favored

Nancy Nygren is CEO of the Girl Scouts of Orange County. She is shocked by how much favoritism boys still get in science classes.

Nygren knows what it's like to be a lone science-loving girl. After college, she worked on the space shuttle program. Later, she worked as a software programmer.

"I was young and blonde and female, and there weren't many of us," Nygren says. "That's changing, thank goodness."

It's just not happening fast enough.

## It's Hard To See The Future

Broadcom's Golden says that's partly because there are too few role models like Nygren who can encourage girls to work in STEM careers.

Nygren adds, "These young women have no way to see their future."

At the end of her Kaiser experience, 12-year-old Taylor Duzel felt more convinced about a career as a doctor. Taylor does face one surprising hurdle: a weak stomach. She wants to get over that problem first.

"But," Taylor says, "I think I can do it."
