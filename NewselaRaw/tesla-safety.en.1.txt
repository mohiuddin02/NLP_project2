Tesla Motors already claims to have made the electric car that can go the longest between charges. Now it is claiming another automotive achievement â€” building the safest car on the road.

The Palo Alto, Calif., electric car company said that during recent testing by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), "the Model S set a new record for the lowest likelihood of injury to occupants."

Officials at the federal agency did not return calls seeking confirmation of Tesla's claim. But the sporty Model S did win a five-star safety rating from the NHTSA. The ranking is reserved for the vehicles that do best in the agency's crash-test program.

As a government agency, the NHTSA sets and enforces vehicle safety standards.

## Tesla Says It Got 5.4 Stars

"NHTSA does not publish a star rating above 5; however, safety levels better than 5 stars are captured in the overall Vehicle Safety Score provided to manufacturers, where the Model S achieved a new combined record of 5.4 stars," Tesla said.

The company said that not having a big gasoline engine in the front of the car is a safer design. It creates "a much longer crumple zone to absorb a high-speed impact," Tesla said. The "the crumple zone" is designed to be smashed and absorb some of the energy in a crash.  "The longer the crumple zone, the more time there is to slow down occupants" and prevent injuries, Tesla said.

The architecture of an electric car also helped in the rollover test, the company said. Tesla tucks its large, heavy battery pack below the floor of the car, adding stability and improving handling, it said.

During testing, "the Model S refused to turn over via the normal methods," Tesla said. "Special means were needed to induce the car to roll."

The Model S is getting good reviews from a variety of sources. In May, Consumer Reports said it was one of the best cars the influential magazine has ever tested.

## Co-Founder A High-Tech Dreamer

Tesla is trying to become the first successful U.S. automotive startup in nearly a century. It was [co-founded](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=entrepreneur)by Elon Musk, who started a number of technology companies. One of them is SpaceX. Recently, Musk unveiled Hyperloop, a high-speed transit system to connect Los Angeles with San Francisco.

Hyperloop, which Musk called faster than a speeding bullet train, was designed by a dozen engineers from SpaceX and Tesla. Existing only on paper right now, Hyperloop is designed to shoot passenger capsules through a tube like an air hockey puck. The trip would take a half hour.

Back on the road, Tesla started selling the Model S about a year ago.

The price of a Model S starts at $63,570. It climbs to well above $100,000 if a customer springs for a larger battery that extends the vehicle's range to over 200 miles on one charge, which is more than double that of other electric cars.

Tesla earned $11.2 million, its first profit, in the first quarter of this year. The maker of high-end electric cars squeezed out an operating profit of $26 million in the second quarter. The results surprised investors and automotive business experts on Wall Street who had expected smaller profit numbers from the automaker.

## Special Credits Help

Tesla collects special credits from California as well as other environmental credits every time it sells a Model S. The credits have helped its finances. It has sold about $150 million of such credits to other automakers so far this year.

Tesla expects to sell about 20,000 of its Model S cars in 2013.

Tesla builds the Model S at a factory in Fremont, Calif., where it plans to also make an electric SUV built on the same platform as the Model S and sharing much of its technology. It plans to start building the SUV next year.
