ATLANTA â€” International health officials warned Friday that the deadly Ebola virus in Africa was moving faster than they could control it. Meanwhile, U.S. health providers prepared for the arrival of two Americans infected with the disease.

The two Americans are being moved from Liberia to Atlanta, according to the Christian aid group Samaritan's Purse. The move was underway this weekend.

Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, a missionary, are currently in serious condition, the group said.

On Saturday, Brantly arrived in Atlanta and was taken by ambulance to Emory University Hospital. He will be treated in a special containment unit there. The unit is one of only four of its kind in the nation. It isolates infected patients from other areas of the hospital.

The isolation units were built in cooperation with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Writebol is expected to be flown to Atlanta in a few days, the hospital said.

## "Out Of Control" Virus

In Africa, Dr. Margaret Chan, head of the World Health Organization, said that the international group planned to release $100 million to fight the disease. More than 1,300 people have been infected with the virus and 729 have died.

"This outbreak is moving faster than our efforts to control it," she said Friday at a meeting in Guinea. If things get worse, there could be a great number of lives lost and the disease could spread to other countries, she said. The disease could also cause major economic hardships.

In addition, the aid group Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said Friday that the virus was "out of control" in Sierra Leone and Liberia. The group said it has already sent 550 health workers to Africa and doesn't have the ability to send more help.

There is no vaccine or specific treatment for Ebola and the disease kills 60 to 90 percent of the people it infects. It is spread through direct contact with the organs, blood or other fluids of infected people.

People who are infected with the virus experience sudden fever, intense weakness, muscle pain and headaches. They also vomit and have diarrhea. The disease can cause kidney and liver failure, as well as bleeding inside the body.

## Doctors Say We're Safe Here

Samaritan's Purse said that other, noninfected workers are already in the process of departing West Africa.

Word that two infected patients were being transported to the United States for medical care has scared some people. They worry that the disease could begin to spread here. However, Dr. Anthony Fauci insisted that this was highly unlikely. He runs the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

Dr. Fauci noted the U.S. health care system has the ability to separate people who are infected. "It's the lack of health care infrastructure that leads to the problems," he said.

Still, people near Emory University Hospital said they were uncomfortable with the idea of Ebola patients being treated in their hometown.

"What? No, that worries me," Lisa Jackson told a reporter while sitting at a nearby bus stop. "Why are they bringing them here? They shouldn't even let them across the border," she said.

Greg Hammock disagreed but admitted he worried about the possibility of the virus spreading. "All I know is Emory better be on top of their game," he said. "If this is the only place they can get help, then sure they should bring them here."

Alexis Walker praised Emory and the CDC for the transfer. "It's good to know when someone needs help and medical care, there's someplace they can go," Walker said.

As Walker spoke, a woman drove by the hospital wearing a mask over her face. Walker said it was those kinds of sights, and social media postings warning of a deadly virus reaching American shores, that gave people the wrong idea about the situation. "What they're doing is making people afraid," she said.

## Isolation Traditionally Stops The Outbreak

On Thursday, the CDC warned against travel to the West African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

"We do not have effective treatment or vaccine for Ebola," said Dr. Tom Frieden, the head of the CDC. "There is no proven treatment. There is no proven vaccine. There is not likely to be one for at least a year, even in the best case scenario. We are not going to treat or vaccinate our way out of these outbreaks."

Frieden added, "We are going to use the traditional means that work." He described communication between health care workers, identifying people who are infected, isolating them from other people and finding people they have been in contact with. "That's what has stopped every Ebola outbreak that's ever happened before. That's what will stop this Ebola outbreak."

Writebol reportedly received an "experimental" drug of which there was only enough for one person. Brantly reportedly received a "unit of blood" from a 14-year-old boy who survived the disease. The boy's family wanted to thank the doctor for saving his life.

Leaders from across Africa will hold a summit next week in Washington, D.C. President Barack Obama said U.S. officials were working to minimize any risk of Ebola spreading to this country.
