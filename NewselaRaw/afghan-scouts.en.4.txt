KABUL, Afghanistan -- Mohammad Aziz Ayob adjusts his Boy Scout neckerchief. He leans over and plants a sapling into the dry Kabul soil. Two helicopters pass overhead. The clack-clack clack-clack of their blades echoes off the neighboring mountains.

It seems dangerous for young boys to wear matching uniforms in a war zone. But leaders of Afghanistan's new Scouting program say community service is badly needed. So is learning to rely on yourself.

Ayob was orphaned as a child and is being raised by his aunt. He can barely afford to attend high school, and is worried about finding a job. But his worries disappear when he puts on his Scout shirt. "I love my uniform; it makes me feel proud," said Ayob, 18. "Scouts are like my family."

The Scout motto is "Be Prepared." This has a very special meaning in Afghanistan. Here Scouts risk death to attend meetings. They have to learn how to spot roadside bombs in first aid class.

## Keeping Girl Scouts Safe

Because of these dangers, Girl Scouts are much less visible. The girls do volunteer work in hospitals instead of working outside like the boys.

Mohammad Tamim Hamkar is Afghan Scouting's program manager. He said that "it's hard to let the girls do everything."

Yet organizers say that girls often make better Scouts than boys. That's because the girls have to grab any chances they can get in a country that is dominated by men and boys. Keith Blackey, 68, is an American helping the Scouts in Afghanistan. He said that some girls get confidence from wearing a Scout uniform. "It's like a superhero putting on a cape," he said.

## A Hard History

Things have been difficult for Scouts in Afghanistan over the years. Scouting was introduced in 1931. The movement has been banned several times. Sometimes, Scouts were even told to spy on their parents.

A charity called Parsa supported the Afghan Scouts in 2009. Parsa sees Scouting as a way to teach leadership to children. There are Scout groups in six of Afghanistan's 34 provinces. Most of these places are too dangerous for international visitors.

Hamkar said that some of the Scout uniforms are very old. Some of the Scouting books are unfinished. There is very little money to go around. At the moment, Scouting in Afghanistan is paid for by donations from other countries.

But the program now has 1,062 members, 40 percent of them girls. It hopes to have 1,500 Scouts signed up by the end of 2013.

## An Uncertain Future

Terrorists in Afghanistan may attack anyone they think has been involved with foreign countries. The Scout movement is linked to the Western world. This could be dangerous for Afghan scouts if there is further trouble in the country. In 2014, soldiers from the U.S. and its allies will withdraw from Afghanistan. No one is sure what will happen after this.

Marnie Gustavson is the head of Parsa. "If things get ugly, anything with an international connection could be targeted," said Gustavson.  Scout leaders are working hard to make Scouting a part of Afghan life.

In Ghor province, Scouts clean mosques. This shows that the program is not trying to threaten Afghan traditions. Blackey said that Scouting is not trying to promote a different religion. "We're teaching them the same things their parents are," the adviser added.

## Can Scouting Survive?

During the dark years in Afghanistan, loyal Scouts were forced to hide their uniforms. "I was too scared to wear mine, even alone in my room," said training commissioner Mustafa. "Sometimes I'd peek in the drawer, though, and remember better times."

Mike Farrar is another American who helps to train Afghan Scouts. He believes the program is important to the country.

"I never went to a Scout meeting where I had to wear a flak jacket and carry a weapon," he said. "If the Taliban comes back, obviously Scouting goes away. But if the Taliban doesn't, Afghanistan will embrace it."
