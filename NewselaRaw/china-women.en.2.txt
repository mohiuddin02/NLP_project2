SHANGHAI â€” For the last two years, Karen Xie has met on average one marriage candidate a month. They've all been Mr. Wrong.

Some were too short or too fat, she says. Some didn't express enough tenderness. For her last date, her parents fixed her up with a man from their hometown, Wuhan, 500 miles west of Shanghai. Xie knew it was over as soon as she laid eyes on him.

"He was a little bald, he had no hair in the middle of his head," said Xie, 32.

Xie earns a good salary at a media company. She has her own digs on the edge of Shanghai, which she and her parents bought to boost her chances of marriage. "Maybe my standards are too high, but I don't require an apartment," she said.
## Single, And Reminded Of It

In theory, women like Xie should have their pick of potential husbands. China's one-child policy means there are more men because many families prefer sons. Chinese men between the ages of 20 and 44 will outnumber women by 24 million by 2020, one forecast says.

Yet more and more professional Chinese women say they just can't find a man who is as accomplished as they are. Others say that after years of schooling, they want to enjoy their freedom past age 27. That is the age when they are expected to settle down.

The women are called as shengnu, or "leftover women." They are educated and live in cities.  Many face  intense pressure to marry. Parents fear that their daughters will end up childless and lonely. They also worry the women could have trouble supporting themselves.

The government, scholars and even some businesses treat shengnu as the source of potentially serious social problems.

They've warned that if the number of shengnu increase, imbalances between the sexes could get worse. The women could lure married men into affairs. Real estate sales could fall, too. Home-buying, after all, is usually part of getting married in China.

For women like Xie, it's become almost impossible to avoid being reminded of being single.
## "Shengnu Are Demonized"

If it's not a call with the parents, it's a flier or email promoting a matchmaking event. Turn on the TV and you can watch "The Price of Being a Shengnu," "Go, Go, Shengnu," "Even Shengnu Get Crazy." The shows all have similar plotlines: Smart, beautiful, successful women try everything to get a man.

Not even a shopping spree can help single women get their mind off marriage. The stores are full of reminders. "Twelve products to help shengnu forget about loneliness!" blared a recent ad for a home goods store. Suggested items included a garlic peeler, rainbow-colored bedding and a one-seater couch.

Even a visit to the website of the All-China Women's Federation offers little relief. The state-run feminist agency in recent years has published articles with titles like "Eight Simple Moves to Escape the Leftover Women Trap."

"Shengnu are being demonized," said Sandra Bao. She started a group called Leftover Attitude in Shanghai to support unmarried professional women. "Parents are pressuring us, the media label us, there's a whole industry of matchmakers and others out there telling us it's a problem to be single."

The pressure seems to be working.
## Feeling Singled Out

The average age of a woman's first marriage in China is rising. But by age 35, more than 90 percent of Chinese women have married, said Roseann Lake, a Beijing-based researcher who is writing a book on marriage in China.

"Chinese women are only left over for a limited time, which makes the fact that they're labeled 'leftovers' even more hideous," Lake said.

Leta Hong Fincher is a scholar who has studied the topic. She said Chinese women have a high rate of marriage. A big part of that is due to the government's successful publicity campaign which makes shengnu feel singled out.

Many parents go to great lengths to help their children find mates. Lake said she knows of one mother who posed as her daughter online to set up dates for her.

Others turn to matchmakers. In Shanghai, there are about 130 such agencies. Some charge more than $16,000 in fees, according to Zhou Juemin, head of the Shanghai Matchmaking Association.
## Vital Info, And Photo, On A Paper

There is a section of Shanghai's People's Park known as Matchmaking Corner. On weekends, middle-aged women comb through papers strung out like shorts on clotheslines. Each lists a single person's age, height, education and other vital information, along with a photo.

Given that Chinese women traditionally pair off with men of equal or higher income, education and age, it can be difficult for top-tier women (and bottom-rung men) to find matches. Adding to the pressure, some women insist that a groom have a house.

Though the pressure on shengnu looks unlikely to go away any time soon, some women are gently pushing back.

Bao's Leftover Attitude group has more than 2,000 members nationwide. And Los Angeles-based author Joy Chen published "Do Not Marry Before Age 30." It sits on the shelves of Chinese bookstores, alongside self-help titles about how to find a man.
