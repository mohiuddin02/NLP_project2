A Washington state oyster family built a 20,000-square-foot shellfish hatchery half an ocean from Seattle. They get their young oysters from a green patch of island below a tropical volcano. Ocean acidification, a change in the acid levels in the water, left the Nisbet family no choice.

Carbon dioxide from burning gasoline and oil had turned seawater along Washington's coast deadly. Slippery young Pacific oysters had stopped growing. The same ocean water got sucked into an Oregon hatchery. It killed larvae the family had bought as oyster seed.

So the Nisbets took out loans, spent $1 million and moved half their company 3,000 miles away.

## Water Turns Lethal For Oysters

"I was afraid for everything we'd built," Goose Point Oyster Co. founder Dave Nisbet said of the hatchery, which opened last year. "We had to do something."

Oysters started dying by the billions along the Northwest coast in 2005. They have been struggling ever since. Scientists cautiously linked the deaths to plummeting ocean pH in 2008 and 2009. Low pH means the water is more acidic. But few outside the West Coast's $110 million industry believed it.

Scientists confirmed the link early last year, but the several hundred oyster growers in the region already showed what was happening. Ocean acidification was walloping sea life and hurting people.

"I don't care if you think it's the fault of humans or not," Nisbet said. "If you want to keep your head in the sand, that's up to you. But the rest of us need to get it together because we're not out of the woods yet on this thing."

The industry in Washington employs about 3,200 people and produces one-quarter of the nation's oysters.

## Business Turns Bad, Very Fast

The Nisbets bought 10 acres of tidelands near Bay Center in 1975 and built their business over the years, one market at a time.

Sometimes Dave Nisbet's daughter Kathleen, now 27, came along, sipping a baby bottle and eating cookings while riding with her father. The Nisbets eventually pieced together 500 acres of tidelands and hired 70 people. For a long time, business was good — until, overnight, it suddenly wasn't.

In 2005, when no young oysters survived in Willapa Bay at all, farmers blamed the luck of nature. After two more years with essentially no new oysters being born, panic set in. Then things got worse.

By 2008, oysters were dying at Oregon's Whiskey Creek Hatchery, which draws water directly from the Pacific Ocean. The next year, it struck a Taylor Shellfish hatchery outside Quilcene, which gets its water from Hood Canal. Owners initially suspected bacteria, but shellfish died even when it wasn't present.

Whiskey Creek hatchery closed for weeks at a stretch. Production at Taylor Shellfish dropped more than 60 percent. The entire industry was on the edge. Growers worried that in just a few years they would not be able to bring shellfish to market.

## A Huge Sea Change Noted

In 2008, Kathleen Nisbet fretted about the prospect of laying off people her family had employed since she'd been a baby. And no one, anywhere, could tell them what was wrong — until the oyster growers met the scientists who studied the ocean.

Dick Feely was a government scientist. By the early 2000s he was noting a huge change off the West Coast. Low pH water naturally occurred hundreds of feet down, where the colder water held more CO2. But that corrosive water was rising swiftly, getting ever closer to the surface where most of the marine life humans care about lived.

The deadly water that surfaces off Washington, California and Oregon is the result of CO2 that entered the sea 20 or 30 years earlier. Even if fuel burning stops spewing CO2 immediately, West Coast sea chemistry would worsen for almost as long before leveling off.

It would take 30 to 50 years before the worst of it reached the surface.

The oyster industry pleaded with Congress, which supplied money for new equipment. Over several years, the hatcheries tested their water using high-tech pH sensors. When the pH was low, baby oysters died within two days. By drawing water only when the pH was normal, shellfish production got back on track.

## Hawaiian Hatchery Helps Nisbets

"They told us it was like turning on headlights on a car — it was so clear what was going on," Feely said.

It wasn't until 2012 that Feely and a team from Oregon State University finally showed with certainty that acidification had caused the problem. By then, the Nisbets had moved on. They now had their own hatchery, which drew water from a warm, underground, saltwater aquifer. When the tiny oysters raised there are big enough to produce shells, they are mailed back to Washington and planted in Willapa Bay.

With one young son, and a baby on the way, it's been impossible for Kathleen Nisbet not to think about her own next generation.

"I don't think that our government is recognizing that ocean acidification exists," she said. "I don't think society understand the impacts it has. They think ocean acidification ... no big deal, it's a huge ocean."

But the reality is that over the next 10 years the world will have to make significant progress tackling this problem. "We're living proof," Nisbet said. "If you ignore it, it's only going to get worse. Plain and simple: It will get worse."
