LOS ANGELES â€” Imagine paying $20 and sitting down inside a Space Age capsule in Los Angeles. About half an hour later, you're in sight of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.

The same drive would take about six hours. Without bad traffic. A flight is about 90 minutes, after you have gotten to and through the airport.

Los Angeles billionaire Elon Musk thinks the super-fast trip is possible. Musk already made electric cars cool. He revolutionized how people paid for things online. And he changed spaceflight missions for NASA. Now he is taking on California's public transportation system.

On Monday, Musk unveiled the design of his Hyperloop, a $6 billion high-speed transportation system powered by the sun. The line would travel up to 760 miles per hour (mph) and have the feel of an airliner, Musk said. Capsules would hold 28 people each.
## Hyperloop Instead Of Bullet Train

California hasn't asked for his help, and Musk's dream exists only on paper.

The state is in the middle of trying to build its own bullet train. Its $68 billion project has grown in cost and fallen behind schedule. Musk says his system is better and cheaper. He wanted to get it in front of the public, he said, before the state wastes more time and money.

"It would be great to have an alternative to flying or driving, but obviously only if it is actually better than flying or driving," he said. The state's bullet train would not be. It would instead be "both one of the most expensive per mile and one of the slowest in the world."

If he were anybody else, Musk would probably be called crazy. But Musk has a history to back him up. He's led numerous start-up companies in a wide range of industries.

He [co-founded](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=entrepreneur) and sold PayPal to EBay for $1.5 billion. Then Musk started the rocket company SpaceX and co-founded electric car giant Tesla.

Now he sees a new way to travel. This one operates like the air tubes that move envelopes at neighborhood banks.
## Shot Through A Steel Tube

"Normally I would think this idea is borderline crackpot, but this guy has a track record," said scientist and TV host Michio Kaku. "You have to take him seriously. The guy is a doer."

According to Musk's design, the Hyperloop's capsules would be transported at speeds of 300 to 760 mph through a steel tube. The capsules would shoot through the tube on a cushion of air. They would be like pucks gliding on an air hockey table. A magnetic system would speed them up along the way.

The tube would have solar panels on top. The panels would generate much more energy than the Hyperloop would use, Musk said.

The Hyperloop's design is still in its early stages. It would be a trip across the 382 miles, connecting two stations. More stations could be added later. Musk said the system could transport 7.4 million people a year.

The California bullet train system expects many more riders. Planners forecast at least 20 million a year. But outside experts don't agree. They doubt that a lot of drivers or airline passengers will be attracted to the bullet train.
## Hyperloop Lacks Details, Some Say

The California bullet train authority said Musk's new technology is worth considering. But authority Chairman Dan Richard also stressed Musk would have many things to deal with if he went forward with the idea. Those include building a project across earthquake zones, protecting environmental areas and animals, and doing as little as possible to hurt businesses and communities.

People are already critical of the plan. They say it does not have enough details. Its design is unusual. And it has not been examined by outsider experts. They question if the money Musk talks about makes sense.

The California bullet train was designed with politics in mind. The route twists to include medium-size cities on its way to San Francisco. But the winding path added to the cost, and resulted in slower projected trip times.

It's unclear whether Musk could get the support needed to build a system that would not stop at many of the cities on the bullet train's planned path. Musk also would have to deal with California politics to get the plan approved.

"Musk has been able to get away with what he has done because he does it with his own money," said Lou Thompson. He heads review panel that oversees the bullet train project. "You get into the public arena, and that is a different game."
