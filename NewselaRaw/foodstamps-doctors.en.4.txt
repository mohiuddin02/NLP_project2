WASHINGTON â€” Doctors have a warning for Congress: Don't cut food stamps. If it does, the U.S. government could get hit with bigger health bills. Maybe not now, but over time.

Doctors say that the cuts would leave more families without enough food. That could worsen health for the poor. The result would be more visits to doctors' offices or hospitals. And those visits would have to be paid for by the government.

Hunger has many health risks. Among the worst is diabetes. And young children can have problems developing properly. Sometimes young brains don't get enough iron. This can make children have trouble learning in school.

There's a reason doctors are speaking up now: Congress is working on a law that's certain to cut food stamps. By how much is still not clear. Republicans want bigger cuts than do Democrats.

They are the two big parties in our government. Republicans usually want less money spent on things like health and education. Democrats usually want more money spent in those areas.

## Hunger And Health Link

Food stamps currently feed 1 in 7 Americans. They cost the government twice what they cost five years ago. During those five years many Americans lost their jobs. That meant more people needed food stamps.

Those who want the cuts say it's about money. They say the government can't afford to give that many people food stamps. They say the neediest people will not go hungry if food stamps are cut.

But doctors say cutting food aid could backfire. They believe it will lead to higher Medicaid and Medicare costs. Both of those huge health care programs are paid for by the government. Medicaid covers people who have little money. Medicare is for those 65 and over.

Many people want the government to spend less money on health care.

Deborah Frank is a children's doctor. She says cutting food stamps is not the answer. In fact, it's "the dumbest thing you can do."

People don't see the link between hunger and health, she says.

A study published this week helps show that link. Many poor families run out of money for food at the end of the month. And more poor people with diabetes are hospitalized then, too. Trips to the hospital go up compared to the first week of the month.

The reason is clear. Most states send out food stamps at the beginning of the month. So, people often run out of food by the end of the month.

Dr. Hilary Seligman headed up the study. She said money spent on treating people who don't have enough food is high. The money could provide months of food stamps instead.

## Cut Won't Save Money

A different study last year looked at what would happen if food stamps were cut. It found that such a cut wouldn't save money. It would actually make government costs go up. Diabetes treatment costs would rise by a lot.

Other studies have looked at children who don't get enough food. They show that such children are more likely to be hospitalized.

Those pushing for the cuts feel too many people are getting food stamps. They say only those who are truly hungry should get them. They claim such people will have no problem getting help after the cuts.

But those against the cuts are not convinced. They say cutting food stamps could worsen health. And that would raise health costs for the poorest.

"Food is medicine," says Jim McGovern. He's a Democrat in Congress. Those who want cuts look only at "how much we spend," he said. "I wish they understood that if we did this better, we could save a lot more money in health care costs."
