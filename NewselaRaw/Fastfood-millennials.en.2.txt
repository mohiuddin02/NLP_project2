Most people will tell you they prefer fresh, tasty, healthy food over greasy fast food. The millennial generation, though, may be the first to put their money where their mouth is.

Fast-food restaurants say they are getting increasing pressure from the millennial generation to serve better food. Millennials are generally defined as 18- to 34-year-olds. And there's a lot of money at stake â€” more than $1 trillion.

Consumer Reports recently asked readers to judge fast-food chains on quality, value and healthy menu items. They ranked older chains like Burger King, Krystal and Church's Chicken near the bottom. Consumer Reports is a magazine that publishes product reviews.

Although they cost more, fast-casual restaurants are becoming more popular, according to the magazine. The fast-casual category offers counter service, like fast food, but the food is healther.

## Quality Is Beating Out Quickness

Food quality is mattering more to millennials than the convenience of fast food.

"Millennials have a renewed fascination with food," said David Farmer, a vice president at the Chick-fil-A chain. "They grew up on food television and are more knowledgeable about ingredients. And social media has put a lot of attention on quality and customization."

Esther Yi, who is 25, counts herself among that group. Yi is a food lover who thinks her generation knows more about food than other generations. They are more interested in trying new dishes and in good service, she said. They also expect that food be "fresh" and come from nearby farms, if possible.

They frequently post dinner pictures and restaurant reviews online.

Working in fast food's favor is that millennials don't have that much money. Plus, fast-food restaurants are cheap.

But fast-food companies also struggle with that age group. Fast-food restaurants must offer a menu that has to entice the most customers possible. But the more items they add, the more crowded and confused the menus become.

## Tough Call: Salad Or Burger

As with all trends, there are exceptions. Millennials, like all customers, demand healthy choices in surveys. But when they actually walk into a fast-food restaurant, they buy the traditional meals, such as hamburgers and fried chicken, said J.M. Owens, president of the Greater Atlanta McDonald's Operators Association.

"All of us want to do a better job on what we put in our bodies," he said. In reality, though, people feel healthier if they see salads on the McDonald's menu even if they walk in and buy a cheeseburger.

In a sense, that may be why Krystal ranked low in the Consumer Reports survey, said Doug Pendergast, the company's president. Krystal has salads on the menu. But hardly anyone buys them. Sales of salads make up only one-tenth of 1 percent of the total, he said.

"In our research, we have seen a trend where the average customer has asked for more healthful options," he said. "However, what people say in a survey and what they purchase in an actual restaurant are two different things. About 60 percent of all customers buy at least one Krystal hamburger with their order." Still, Pendergast and others involved in the fast-food industry said they are taking notes. Millennials have certain things in common.

## Technology Weighs In On Food Choices

They like food they can share and they are more willing to experiment with different types of food. They love snacking. They also seek out chains with a strong reputation for treating their workers well and using healthy ingredients. Chelsea Phillips, 22, said she knows the big fast-food chains have salads. But she prefers going to Moe's Southwest Grill or Panera Bread because she thinks their ingredients are healthier.

"Moe's has free-range (chicken) and that's important to me because I focus on healthy eating," she said. "It's a choice for me. I can't digest what they have at fast-food restaurants because the grease makes me sick."

Millennials are known as heavy technology users. They use phone apps that allow them to post online about what they eat. Fast-food restaurants need to show this generation that they have low-calorie options.

But Lisa Gearhart thinks millennials are more interested in flavor than in tasteless dishes that are good for them.

"Millennials are also very health conscious, but not health obsessed," Gearhart said. She studies millennials for a Jacksonville, Florida, company.  "For them, dining out is as much a social experience as much as it is about fueling up."

## It's All About Good Food

Atlanta's Wing Zone runs a yearly Facebook competition. The restaurant chain asks fans what new flavors it should develop for its chicken wings, said Matt Friedman, who started the company. Millennials also want their food cooked to order. Friedman said fast-food restaurants will have to be willing to prepare food the way customers want.

McDonald's Owens said that a lot of time has been spent trying to understand what they want. But millennials want the same thing as everyone else, he said. They want "good food that you feel good eating on a regular basis."
