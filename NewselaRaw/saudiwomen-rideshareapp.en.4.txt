RIYADH, Saudi Arabia â€” After Hala Radwan finished studying in France, she came back to Saudi Arabia. She got a job with a big company. Then Radwan realized she had no idea how she would get to and from work.

Saudi Arabia does not allow women to drive.

The country has few buses and trains. Hiring a driver can cost a lot of money. People say mean things when women try to take cabs. Women riding on buses and trains alone are seen as doing something wrong.

"It was a nightmare," she said.

Then friends told her about Uber and a company called Careem. They are like taxi services. You can ask them for a ride through an app on your phone.

## Women Are Happy To Have Ride Apps

In Saudi Arabia's big cities things are changing. More and more people are using apps to get rides. Many people come from other countries to do business in Saudi Arabia. They do not want to deal with the country's confusing taxi system. Women in Saudi Arabia are the biggest users of the apps.

Saudi Arabia follows a strict form of the Muslim religion. It says only a male family member should drive a woman around town. The riding apps give women more freedom. They let them move about on their own.

Radwan is 29 years old. She spends nearly $700 a month on rides from Careem.

A taxi would cost less. However, she can depend on the apps. They are also safer. Both Uber and Careem track exactly where their cars are. With a few taps, Hala can see who will be driving her. She can also see the type of car the driver uses and if his customers liked him in the past.

## Cars, Drivers, Meet Riders

Saudi Arabia has four apps for getting rides. They use the same technology that is used in the United States or Europe. But there are some differences.

In the United States and Europe, the companies use drivers with their own cars. It makes the cost of the ride cheaper. In Saudi Arabia, the companies do not work with drivers who use their own cars. They get their cars and drivers from licensed companies.

Mudassir Sheikha owns Careem. He says his company is trying to be a good citizen and follow rules and offer better service.

His company is run from Dubai, a city in the United Arab Emirates. Careem was one of the first to open in Saudi Arabia. The company started in 2013. It now has about 100,000 customers. That number is growing super fast, Sheikha said.

There are some women who take five to 10 trips with Careem every day, Sheikha said.

## Saudi Women Not Allowed In Driver's Seat

Uber is run from San Francisco and works in more than 300 cities in 56 countries. It came to Saudi Arabia a year ago.

There is no real law that stops women from driving in Saudi Arabia. But there are fatwas that say women should not drive. Fatwas are religious orders from Muslim clerics. The government follows these orders and will not allow women to drive.

Families who have enough money will hire a driver to take the women in the family to different places. But sometimes, even having a driver does not work.

"I have a driver, but sometimes he is too busy bringing my sisters from school," said Gamar al-Douh, who is 24. She comes from a family of three girls. There are no brothers to help with the driving. "If I don't have someone to take me, I use Uber."
