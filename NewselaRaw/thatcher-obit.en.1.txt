Margaret Thatcher, Great Britain's first female prime minister and a powerful political figure, died on April 8 after suffering a stroke. She was 87 years old.

Thatcher had served as prime minister, which is the leader of the government in the United Kingdom, with duties similar to the president of the United States. She ran the country for 11 years, between 1979 and 1990. At the time, there were very few women in politics, especially in powerful positions. Thatcher was such a strong politician that she became known as the "Iron Lady," a nickname she enjoyed.

Through Thatcher's politics and determined personality she changed life in Britain forever. She was also a leader who inspired strong feelings â€“ both good and bad.

Some people think she was the best prime minister in British history, while others believe she was the worst. Since her death there have been fierce arguments about Thatcher's legacy.

## Modest Beginnings

Thatcher was born as Margaret Hilda Roberts in October 1925. She did not come from a wealthy family as have many politicians. Rather, she was born in an apartment above the grocery store that her father owned.

A gifted student, Thatcher went to Oxford University, where she became more and more interested in politics. She quickly rose through the ranks to become a member of Parliament in 1959. Being an MP in the United Kingdom is similar to serving in Congress in the United States. Thatcher became prime minister at the age of 53 in 1979.

Britain, like the United States with the Democrats and Republicans, has two main parties. Labour represents the liberal wing of politics while the Conservative party, nicknamed the Tories, stands for the conservative wing.

Thatcher had her own particular set of beliefs that became known as Thatcherism. She ruled by the politics of Thatcherism throughout her long and powerful political career.

## "Thatcher The Milk Snatcher"

Thatcher believed in a small state, meaning that the government should have limited power over the lives of its people. Thatcher said, "There is no such thing as society. There are individual men and women and there are families."

Following that ideology, Thatcher made it so that people would have to pay fewer and lower taxes. As a result, they would have more money in their pockets, but enjoy fewer services provided by the government.

A famous example of Thatcher's cuts to services made her unpopular among children. The British government had given all schoolchildren a daily bottle of free milk since the end of World War II. The government hoped that the milk would improve nutrition for younger generations. When Thatcher was in charge of education, she stopped the milk for all children above age 7. This earned her another nickname: "Thatcher The Milk Snatcher."

Thatcher believed that business competition would make Britain more efficient and richer. In order to increase this competition, Thatcher took harsh measures against what she considered to be underperforming industries, like coal mining, but encouraged the growth of industries that she thought to be more profitable, like banking.

## Looking For Profits

Industries in Britain, like in most other countries, are grouped in certain regions. The banking industry, which is located in and around London, thrived during Thatcher's leadership and continues to do so today. But her policies also meant the widespread closure of large numbers of coal mines, factories and shipyards, which were mostly located in northern England, Scotland and Wales.

Because she believed in limited help from the government, it also meant that workers in these areas struggled to find new employment. Thatcher's government did not want to invest in training or other opportunities.

Workers protested against these difficult conditions by going on strike, which meant stopping their employer's production by refusing to go to work themselves. The most important example was the huge miners' strike of 1984-85. This made international headlines as one of the longest industrial disputes in European history.

## Winning International Wars

The strikes caused great divides in society and Thatcher described the miners as the "enemy" inside Britain. But she had "enemies" internationally too. The territory of the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic Ocean is still disputed between Britain and Argentina. In 1982, Argentina invaded the islands and Thatcher responded with British military forces. The U.K. won a two-month war with Argentina and this helped Thatcher's popularity in Britain.

Thatcher had a very strong relationship with U.S. President Ronald Reagan. The pair were friends as well as political allies. Reagan and Thatcher worked together to negotiate with the leader of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev. By working together, Reagan, Thatcher and Gorbachev helped end the Cold War peacefully. The Cold War, a period of political and military tension between the U.S. and its allies against the USSR and its allies, had raged for a few decades.

## Controversial To The End

Thatcher resigned as prime minister in November 1990 and had been unwell for several years before her death. When she died, current Prime Minister David Cameron said, "As our first woman prime minister, Margaret Thatcher succeeded against all the odds. Margaret Thatcher didn't just lead our country. She saved our country."

As always with Thatcher, someone was quick to say the opposite.

Ken Livingstone, a former mayor of London, said, "Every real problem we face today is the legacy of the fact she was fundamentally wrong."

Maybe no one will ever agree on whether Thatcher was good, bad, or somewhere in between, but her politics and personality made Britain the place it is today.
