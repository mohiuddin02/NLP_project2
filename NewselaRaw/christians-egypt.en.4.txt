KERDASA, Egypt â€”  Three months ago, hundreds of people attacked Archangel Michael church. Six people tried to protect it. Rida Gaballah, 49, was one of them. Now he stands among the ruins of his place of worship.

Gaballah is upset by the destroyed building. The benches where people prayed are gone. Paintings of Jesus are burned. The cross was ripped off from the front door. Gaballah just keeps saying, "This scene is horrible."

The Egyptian government promised to repair this church. But work has not yet begun. It is one of 74 churches destroyed in Egypt. The attacks happened after Egypt's president was thrown out of power. The army forced President Mohammed Morsi out on July 3.

This church stands as a symbol. It shows that the new government has not protected Egypt's historic places.

## Attacks Continue On Churches

But Gaballah does not want to complain about the government. Nor do other Christians. "Of course they are doing enough," he said. But the destroyed church around him told a different story.

The attacks on churches sparked anger at first. This was just after President Morsi was removed from power. Now, both Christian and Muslim Egyptians are completely silent. Yet the attacks continue across the country.

At least 74 attacks on churches happened between June 30 and Sept. 30.  There have been more since, but nobody knows exactly how many.

One out of 10 Egyptians is a Christian. They have never had an easy time in the country. The Christians have been often stuck between the government and a big Muslim population.

Egyptian governments have done little to protect Christians from attacks by Muslims. No one has ever been punished in Egyptian courts for destroying Christian churches. The first church was burned in 1972.

Yet Christians don't want to complain. The new government has not spoken out against Christians.  The Christians don't want to get on the bad side of the latest rulers.

## "Freedom Or The Right To Live"

Many of the attacks on Christian churches were caused by certain Muslim preachers who don't like Christians. They think Christians stand in the way of Egypt being a Muslim country. They claimed that the Christians made Morsi leave power. Morsi was part of the Muslim Brotherhood, a secret group that is again banned in Egypt.

Ishak Ibrahim is an Egyptian Christian. He thinks that Christians want to live under a government run by the army instead of a democracy run by Muslims. "The choice before people is freedom or the right to live," Ibrahim said.

Youssef Sidhom is the editor-in-chief of Watani, Egypt's biggest Christian newspaper. He said that Christians and many Muslims were united against Morsi. They also stood together against the Muslim Brotherhood.

But Sidhom thinks that the Christians are now "terrified to speak."

There is not much pressure on the government to do more for Christians. The police say they don't have enough people to protect 2,000 Christian churches in Egypt. It is harder for the police because their stations have also been attacked.

## Police Blame Muslim Brotherhood

One policeman said that they are not trying to find out who destroyed the churches. He said that some villagers were too scared to talk about who started the fires.

The officer said that keeping churches safe is not the police's job. The police first want to find out who destroyed their stations. They also want to capture members of the banned Muslim Brotherhood.

Other people think the police have different reasons. Every attack on churches gives them more reasons to chase people who liked President Morsi. The police will also get more support from the public. Many Egyptians were shocked by the attacks on churches.

Ahmed Ragab has studied the attacks. He said that when churches are burned, the government can blame the Muslim Brotherhood.

Pope Tawadros II is the leader of Egypt's Christian church. He made a statement after Archangel Michael church was attacked. Tawadros called for national unity and forgiveness.

He also asked for Christians to support the government. "If the hands of evil kill, destroy and torch, then God's hands are greater and they build," he said.
