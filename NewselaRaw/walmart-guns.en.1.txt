AUSTIN, Texas — Managers at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. in Texas have a new task to perform: asking customers if they have a permit to carry a handgun.

To comply with state liquor rules, the world's biggest retailer sent a written notice last month to stores that sell alcohol, telling managers to make sure that customers who openly carry firearms have licenses. Cashiers or door greeters who see someone with a gun are to alert the highest-ranking employee. He or she must approach the customer and ask to see the paperwork.

"We do try to ensure that people have a licensed firearm," said Wal-Mart spokesman Brian Nick. "We are giving direction to our store employees to ask for a license as our management sees appropriate."

The notice was sent out in anticipation of the Lone Star State's open carry law, which went into effect Jan. 1\. It made Texas the nation's most populous state to allow citizens with a permit to carry handguns openly in a holster.

## Retailers Are In A Tough Spot

The measure has put retailers in a quandary. They are being forced to take sides in one of the nation's most fraught debates. Gun-rights activists are boycotting stores that forbid firearms, saying people should not be punished for exercising their constitutional rights. The Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects the right to own and carry guns. Gun-control advocates, meanwhile, are avoiding stores that allow customers to bear arms, saying no one should have to shop where they feel unsafe.

Stuck in the middle are retailers reluctant to risk losing business from either side. Dozens of stores and restaurants across Texas, including HEB Grocery Co., one of the state's largest food retailers, have banned openly carried guns. That has incurred the ire of activists who have vowed to shop elsewhere. Others, such as Kroger Co., have chosen not to ban firearms carried legally, inviting the scorn of gun-control advocates who have promised a boycott of their own.

Wal-Mart's position is unusual because many of its stores sell beer and wine. That's put the company in the crosshairs of the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission, which prohibits unlicensed handguns in places that sell liquor that will be consumed elsewhere. A restaurant or store can lose its liquor license if it "knowingly allows" a person to bring an illegal firearm on the premises, said Chris Porter, spokesman for the agency.

## Companies Try To Walk A Fine Line

Previously a shopper could have been walking the aisles with a concealed weapon — legal in Texas for two decades — and store clerks would not have known. Under the new law, the only way to ensure compliance with the law is to ask a customer with a visible gun for a permit.

"Now that it's open carry, that creates a new space that you have to cover," said George Kelemen, chief executive officer of the Texas Retailers Association. Stores like Wal-Mart want to send the message, "We welcome your patronage, but we sell alcohol and we don't want to risk losing the ability to do that."

Some companies are trying to walk a fine line by publicly opposing guns in their Texas stores, while avoiding posting signs that firearms are prohibited. The coffee giant Starbucks Corp. has requested that customers who are not law-enforcement personnel refrain from bringing firearms into stores. Starbucks has not issued a ban, according to spokeswoman Jaime Riley. Target Corp. has also asked customers not to carry guns openly. It also has not displayed the signs prohibiting it, said spokeswoman Molly Snyder.

## Gun-Control Advocates Target Some Stores

That balancing act is not sitting well with gun-control advocates. The Texas chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America has begun targeting stores that have publicly opposed the open carry law but have not displayed the official signs prohibiting it. The group is connected to Everytown for Gun Safety and is backed by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and advocates for stricter gun control laws. The ex-mayor is the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent company Bloomberg LP.

"The strongest statement businesses can make for their customers' safety and care is getting that sign up," said Alexandra Chasse. She is a spokeswoman for the Texas chapter of Moms Demand Action.

Wal-Mart says it is asking customers to show a pistol permit only in Texas stores that sell alcohol. Wal-Mart itself sells rifles and shotguns. The company says its policy is to follow all local, state and federal laws, said Nick.

## Pro-Gun Activists Are Also Troubled

Still, its position has begun to trouble gun-rights activists as they walk into their local Wal-Mart Supercenter with pistols on their hips.

"I find it offensive," said C.J. Grisham, president of gun-rights group Open Carry Texas. Grisham has heard from group members who shop at Wal-Mart that they have been asked for permits. "I don't want to be treated suspect by a place that I'm shopping at."

On Sunday night, 25-year-old Ashley Bravo de Rueda walked into a Wal-Mart in Wichita Falls to buy pacifiers for her infant son and dog food. She had her Bersa Thunder .380 pistol on her hip. Almost immediately she was approached by an employee.

The employee said, "Ma'am, you are more than welcome to carry a gun like that, but I'm going to need to see your license," she recalled.

Startled by the encounter, Bravo de Rueda nonetheless pulled out her permit and proceeded to shop.

"The whole time I felt like I was looking over my shoulder," she said. "To me, I'm lawfully carrying. I should not be stopped for something that I am not doing wrong."
