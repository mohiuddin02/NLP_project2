PRESCOTT, Ariz. â€” The horse kicked up dirt as he trotted out of his trailer. He is Bruce, the chestnut-colored horse that just could not win.

His last, best chance is Bryce Runyan. The 25-year-old is a calf roper in the rodeo.

Other cowboys "said he could not run how they wanted," Runyan said. "I saw he could run the way I wanted."

## Smarter Than The Average Bronco?

Bruce was not bold or fierce enough for bronco riding, the rodeo event where cowboys try to stay on a bucking horse.

However, Bruce was quick and strong, and he had something those wild-eyed broncos did not. He was smart, and in calf roping, a smart horse can win. Calf roping is a rodeo event involving a calf and a rider on a horse. The rider throws a circle of rope around the calf's neck. Then, he or she gets off the horse, runs to the calf, and ties three of its legs together. This is all done in seconds.

Before Runyan had Bruce he had Maverick. Maverick was a great horse. He and Runyan won first place and $5,000 in last year's Prescott rodeo. However, he was getting older and he and Runyan had grown too used to each other. Maverick would guess where Runyan wanted him to go and move on his own. This sometimes happens to rodeo horses and it can cause them to lose.

## Can A Nice Horse Finish First?

Runyan tried two other horses but had no luck. Then, he found Bruce. He was a sweet horse, said the family who owned him, but no champion.

A calf roper and his horse must wait to enter the ring behind a gate. After the calf runs a certain distance, the gate falls and the rider begins the chase. Sometimes a rider gets too eager and goes early. When this happens, he or she mush wait 10 extra seconds.

These seconds matter. Riders can win by tenths of seconds.

## Over In Half A Second

Runyan waited on his horse and the calf ran out of the gate. It ran to the center and Runyan could not adjust. He and Bruce went through the gate too early.

That was it. A half-second and the show was over for Runyan.

Runyan thinks of growing up and leaving rodeo some day. He may marry his girlfriend and work a job that requires less traveling. He is not making a lot of money, but he is not losing a lot of money either.

He has a future already set in building work. It is his father's business.

For now he wants to keep riding.

## Fastest Time Ever!

A few days later the cowboy goes to a rodeo in Taylor, Arizona. If Runyan does not win, he might not make it to the National Finals Rodeo.

At the Taylor rodeo he prepared his horse. A cowboy nudged a black calf forward until it sprinted out of the gate.

Runyan and Bruce ran out and caught up with the calf in 3.2 seconds. Runyan swooped the rope around the calf's neck. He got off Bruce and tied the calf's three legs together. He finished in 9.7 seconds. The time surprised him. It was his fastest time ever, even better than with Maverick.

"Well, folks!" the announcer said. "How about that!"

## The Right Partner

Runyan did not even smile. A graying cowboy waved him over, and they spoke for two seconds.

"He said, 'Good ride,'" Runyan said.

This is the way it is in rodeos. There is no showy victory lap. Just a handshake and a check, this one for $2,000.

However, Runyan came away with something even better. The cowboy now knows he had been right all along. Bruce was a good rodeo horse. He, like Runyan, only needed the right partner.
