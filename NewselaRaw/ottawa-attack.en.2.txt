OTTAWA, Ontario â€” A gunman shot and killed a soldier guarding Canada's war memorial on Wednesday. The killer then fired dozens of shots inside the government's Parliament building, but was shot dead by the sergeant-at-arms posted inside.

Canada's highest official, the prime minister, called it the country's second terror attack in three days.

"We will not be intimidated. Canada will never be intimidated," Prime Minister Stephen Harper pledged in a statement to the nation.

Harper was addressing a meeting of members of Parliament when the attack began just before 10 a.m. Gunfire boomed through the building. Members of the government barricaded doors with chairs while others streamed from the building in fear.

## Gunman Called A Militant

The gunman was identified as 32-year-old Michael Zehaf-Bibeau. He had a long criminal history with convictions for assault, robbery, drug and weapons offenses, and other crimes. A government official said Zehaf-Bibeau was a recent convert to Islam.

Harper described him as an "ISIL-inspired terrorist." He was referring to the extremist group Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. It has also been called the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Levant is the English term for the land stretching from southern Turkey through Syria to Egypt.

ISIL has called for revenge against Canada and other Western countries because they joined the United States in a military air campaign against its fighters in Iraq and Syria.

The soldier guarding the National War Memorial was Corporal Nathan Cirillo. According to witnesses, Cirillo was shot at close range by Zehaf-Bibeau. The gunman carried a rifle and was dressed all in black with his face half-covered by a scarf. Witnesses said the gunman appeared to raise his arms in triumph, then headed for Parliament which is a few hundred yards away.

People fled the government building, where Canada's laws are made. Others took cover inside. Police with rifles and body armor took up positions outside and blocked off access to the normally busy streets around Parliament.

## "Strengthen Our Resolve"

On Twitter, Canada's justice minister and other government officials credited 58-year-old sergeant-at-arms Kevin Vickers with shooting the attacker just outside the meeting rooms inside Parliament. Vickers serves a largely ceremonial role at the House of Commons. His position as a guard has been historically symbolic. He carries a decorative staff, called a scepter, and wears green robes, white gloves and a tall hat.

At least three people were treated for minor injuries.

In Washington, President Barack Obama condemned the shootings as "outrageous" and said: "We have to remain vigilant." The U.S. embassy in Ottawa was locked down for safety, and security was tightened at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery just outside Washington.

Canadian Prime Minister Harper vowed that the attacks will "lead us to strengthen our resolve and redouble our efforts." He promised to keep the country safe and work with Canada's allies to fight militants.

Police said in the initial hours that as many as two other gunmen may have taken part in the attacks. But by late in the evening, the blocked roads around Parliament were opened again and police said there was no longer any threat to the public in the area.

## At The National War Memorial

A witness named Tony Zobl said he saw the Canadian soldier being gunned down. Zobl was looking down from his fourth-floor window directly above the National War Memorial.

"I looked out the window and saw a shooter, a man dressed all in black with a kerchief over his nose and mouth and something over his head as well, holding a rifle and shooting an honor guard in front of the cenotaph point-blank, twice," Zobl told the Canadian Press news agency. The cenotaph is an empty tomb, memorializing Canada's soldiers who died while serving their country.

"The honor guard dropped to the ground, and the shooter kind of raised his arms in triumph holding the rifle," Zobl said.

The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation had video of the gunman going to his car alone with his weapon after the shooting at the memorial. The car was later spotted parked in front of Parliament Hill, just down the block.

## Tweets About The Attack

Cabinet minister Tony Clement tweeted that at least 30 shots were heard inside Parliament, where members of Parliament were holding their weekly meetings.

"I'm safe locked in a office awaiting security," Kyle Seeback, another member of Parliament, tweeted.

"I hear this pop, pop, pop. Possibly 10 shots, don't really know. Thought it was dynamite or construction rather than anything else," said John McKay, a member of Parliament.

He said security guards then came rushing down the halls, herding them toward the back of the buildings.

Canada was already on alert. Two days earlier, a man killed one soldier and injured another with his car before being shot to death by police. Officials said he had recently converted to Islam. He had been under investigation by officials who believed he was a militant. They seized his passport when he tried to travel to Turkey.

After the shootings, officials canceled two events in Toronto honoring Pakistani teenager and Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai. She was shot in the head by a militant in Pakistan in 2012 for supporting schooling for girls.

Malala was supposed to receive honorary Canadian citizenship while in Toronto.
