JOHANNESBURG, South Africa â€” Bodies of people who died from the deadly Ebola virus were in the streets of Sierra Leone last week as the country's round-the-clock curfew began. The curfew asked everyone in the West African nation to stay indoors for three days. It was designed to halt the spread of the Ebola virus.

However, people were angry about being told to stay inside. Sierra Leone is an area where rumors and conspiracy theories are widely believed. Some people don't want to be alone, even if they have the disease, which is highly contagious.

People attacked a team that was wearing biohazard suits. The team's job was to bury the bodies. The angry crowd forced the burial team to abandon the bodies and run.

The curfew was in the second of its three days. It closed much of the country and forced everyone but essential services workers and health volunteers to stay at home.

## President Asks People To Help

"Today, the life of everyone is at stake, but we will get over this difficulty if we all do what we have been asked to do," Sierra Leone President Ernest Bai Koroma said. He addressed the country on television last Thursday, just before the curfew was supposed to start. "These are extraordinary times, and extraordinary times require extraordinary measures."

The incident east of Freetown, the capital, was a bad sign. It was only the latest indication of poor communication on Ebola. The information from governments and global health agencies has made people suspicious and resentful. Rumors are flying that the virus is a plot by outsiders to kill people. At least 562 people are believed to have died from Ebola in Sierra Leone.

About 30,000 volunteers are supposed to visit every household in the country by Sunday. They operate in teams of four, each expected to see 20 households a day. After visiting a house, a team makes a chalk mark on the outside. That shows that people living there had been seen.

## Can A Lockdown Really Work?

The aim of the project was to find Ebola sufferers who refused to go into isolation treatment wards. Their refusal puts others at risk. The effort is also meant to lower fear and distrust. To do that, volunteers plan to share information about the disease with the country's 6 million citizens.

However, some people have said that the program's goal is not realistic. Humanitarian workers have said the effort could do more harm than good. They worry that it could harm relationships between the population and health care workers.

"It has been our experience that lockdowns and quarantines do not help control Ebola," the medical charity Doctors Without Borders said. It issued a statement when the curfew was proposed. Quarantines lead to families hiding people who might have Ebola. It "ends up spreading the disease further."

Most people remained at home Saturday. But news agencies reported some people ran off to avoid the curfew.

Saturday's attack on a team trying to bury five dead followed several attacks on health workers in the nearby country of Guinea. There was one deadly case last week. Eight members of a health care group trying to help the Ebola patients were killed by villagers. The Sierra Leone team eventually did manage to bury the five bodies with the help of a police escort.

The government's emergency Ebola operation center had received 102 calls by Saturday afternoon. Each call meant they had found a new suspected Ebola case, Steven Gaoja told reporters. Gaoja runs the operation center.

"On the whole we came out successful. We feel confident that the initial problems we encountered have been slashed," he said.

## They Have A Tough Job Ahead

Sierra Leone is not the only nation adopting tough measures. The number of people infected with Ebola has soared in West Africa. The Liberian government sealed off an entire neighborhood in the capital, Monrovia. It forced more than 50,000 residents to stay inside for more than a week.

Governments in five West African countries have reported more than 5,300 suspected and confirmed Ebola cases. There have been 2,600 deaths, according to figures released by the World Health Organization. Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea make up most of the cases.

The people going door to door in Sierra Leone are sometimes quickly trained volunteers. They will likely have a difficult job working out which families are hiding sick people. But some people living in Sierra Leone support the campaign. They hope that it will stop the disease from spreading so fast.

"It will protect our country from this dangerous virus. Many of our people have died, nurses and doctors too," Ishmail Bangura said. "So if they ask us to stay home for three days, for me it is not bad."
