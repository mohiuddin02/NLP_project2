BALTIMORE, Md. â€” Devin Allen plans to get the word "smile" tattooed on his trigger finger.

He will do this partly to remember his West Baltimore neighborhood, where many of his friends have been shot and killed by guns. The tattoo is also about the fact that Allen is a photographer.

In late April, a man named Freddie Gray died of an injury he received while being held by the police. Many people from Baltimore were upset that this happened. They blamed the police for Gray's death. They protested his death on the streets. Before long these protests became riots, where people, homes and shops were hurt and damaged.

Allen took pictures of the protests.

He uploaded dozens of his photos to Instagram and Twitter. The photos were shared with his several thousand followers in real time.

Then Time magazine put one on the cover.

The cover photo is a shot of a single blurred figure running from a wall of police.

## Sick Of Injustice

While other news reporters arrived and just filmed the sensational parts of the riots, Allen was there when it all started. At first he took pictures of peaceful demonstrations. Then, he says, things got more dangerous after some fans leaving a baseball game started yelling hateful things at the protesters.

Outsiders made the rioting that followed Gray's funeral on April 27 seem like an overreaction to one man's death. However, Allen says the relationship between the mainly black inner city and the police has been bad for a long time. He's been racially profiled himself, he says, stopped by the police and searched just because of his race.

The riots, he says, were started by young people just like him, sick of the injustice.

## A Community Comes Together

Allen also captured something others didn't: He stuck around after the riots, taking photos of the community coming together again. "They (were) doing cookouts on some blocks since a lot of stores were closed," he says. "Kids playing basketball, dancing and singing, the day after Freddie Gray's funeral."

Unlike many photographers, Allen didn't just take pictures of the looting or the smashed police cars.

Allen, now 27, taught himself how to use the camera through YouTube tutorials and trial and error. "I didn't find myself until I was 23, when I got a camera in my hand," he says.

## A Camera In His Hand

When his daughter, Amari, was born three years earlier, he was still trying out different jobs. Until a few weeks ago, he was working the overnight shift at a home for people with disabilities. After missing a week's worth of sleep to work at night and photograph during the day, he decided to dedicate all his time to becoming an artist.

It's a role that has disconnected him from a lot of the people he grew up with, including his daughter's mother. He now spends his days taking photos and lives with his mom to save money. Yet, he says, "I found myself, and I'm happy."

Now, he wants to leave behind a legacy for his daughter and other children growing up in Baltimore, where he says death is "never that surprising." He's set up a Go Fund Me campaign to raise $10,000 for camera equipment to teach neighborhood kids photography and give them an outlet other than drugs or violence. "I want to show them they have a voice," he says.

## Lots Of Other Baltimores

During the protests, his images went viral and he now boasts nearly 79,000 followers on Instagram and more than 10,000 on Twitter. Before the protests Allen thought about moving to New York to be around a larger artistic community. Now he realizes that there's still work to be done in his home town and other towns like it.

There are lots of other places like Baltimore, where people outside the inner city can't understand that there is still conflict between people from different races. By capturing that in an image, he says, he can give people a glimpse of why riots happen.

"My pictures are supposed to keep you aware," he says. "To make you think. To make you feel."
