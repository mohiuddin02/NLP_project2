The United States and Britain are sending military troops to Africa. They will try to help stop a deadly disease called Ebola. More than 2,000 people in Africa have died since Ebola was discovered in March.

The troops will build treatment centers in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Both countries are in West Africa.

However, a health group says Ebola is spreading too fast.

Thousands more could catch Ebola, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned. The outbreak, or spread of the disease, began in Guinea. It quickly spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Senegal. It is the worst Ebola outbreak in modern history.

## The Disease Keeps Spreading

In Liberia, the number of new cases is increasing. There are more sick people than hospital beds, the WHO said. As soon as a new care center opens, it is immediately full.

"When patients are turned away at Ebola treatment centers, they have no choice but to return to their communities and homes," the WHO said. The patients spread Ebola to other people.

Those who care for Ebola patients are among those hardest hit. In Liberia, about 152 health care workers have caught Ebola. A total of 79 of them have died. Ebola kills between 5 and 8 out of 10 people who become infected.

Liberia is recovering from years of war. When the Ebola outbreak began, Liberia had about one doctor for every 100,000 people. In the U.S., there are about 250 doctors for every 100,000 people, says the World Bank. Every time a health worker catches Ebola, the disease becomes harder to stop.

Many doctors and nurses are afraid of getting Ebola. This fear is keeping many of them away. Too few of them are coming to care for patients, the WHO said.

People who come down with Ebola run a fever. They feel weak and have muscle pain and headaches. The disease can cause kidney and liver failure. There is no cure.

## Building Two New Hospitals

Sierra Leone is next to Liberia. A WHO doctor there has become sick with Ebola. The doctor will be sent to another hospital to be treated, the WHO said. The doctor was the second WHO doctor in Sierra Leone to get Ebola.

President Barack Obama is sending soldiers and equipment to help. The troops will set up units for people with the disease to stay by themselves. People with Ebola need to be kept away from healthy people. Otherwise, healthy people could get Ebola.

Army Colonel Steve Warren is a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Defense. The soldiers will build a 25-bed hospital in Monrovia to care for health workers. Monrovia is the capital of Liberia.

After the hospital is set up, it will be turned over to the Liberian government. The troops will make sure that supplies stay at the hospital. Supplies, like rubber gloves and mattresses, have been stolen from other Ebola care centers. The soldiers will also help keep it running for up to 180 days.

The U.S. needs to stop Ebola from spreading through Africa and other parts of the world, Obama said. If not, "it could be a serious danger to the United States."

England will build another Ebola care center. That center will be near the Sierra Leone capital of Freetown. The center will have 62 beds.

Local and international workers will run the center. It will include a 12-bed section for health workers who become sick.
