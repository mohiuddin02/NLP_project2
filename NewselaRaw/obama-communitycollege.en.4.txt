WASHINGTON â€” Community colleges may become free for all students.

President Barack Obama announced the plan in a video. He shot it on his airplane, Air Force One. The video was posted on Facebook.

"What I'd like to do is to see the first two years of community college free," Obama said. Only good students would get free school, he said.

The program could help about 9 million students.

Under the plan, the government would pay three-quarters of the cost. States would pay the rest.

Obama did not say how much this would cost the government. Experts said the plan could cost billions of dollars. Students would save about $3,800 a year.

## College Means Better Jobs

If the plan works out, more people would go to a community college, Cecelia Munoz said. She works at the White House. Community colleges last two years. At the end, students get a two-year degree. After that, some students go to regular college for two more years. Then they get a four-year degree. Right now, more people go to a four-year college or university. But four-year state universities are expensive. In the past 30 years, the cost has almost tripled.

The government gives students less money for college than it used to. Obama says this is a big problem. People who go to college earn more money.

## Pay Up!

Two-year colleges are cheaper than four-year universities. Every state charges a different price.

Wyoming's four-year universities are the cheapest. Students there pay $4,646 each year. New Hampshire universities are the most expensive. They cost $14,712 each year.

Community colleges are much cheaper. They cost $2,719 a year in Wyoming. Vermont community colleges are the most expensive in the United States. Students there pay $7,320.

## Making Futures Brighter

There is another benefit, said Ben Miller. He is an expert in Washington. The plan would make students more hopeful about their future.

The plan sends a good message, Miller said. Students will know they can go to college even if they do not have money.

Many students think college costs more than it does. They feel they have no chance of going.

"That's discouraging," Miller said. A kid may think there is no point in even trying very hard in school.
