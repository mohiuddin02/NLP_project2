FLORENCE, S.C. — When Republican Jeb Bush's black Chevrolet Suburban SUV pulled up, the excited crowd packed into the Wholly Smokin' barbecue joint could see him coming. His 6-foot-4 frame poked above the mass of television cameras and reporters waiting for his arrival.

"What we need is quiet, strong leadership," Bush told about 150 people one afternoon last week, after shaking hands around the room and posing for dozens of cellphone pictures. "It's not about the big personalities on the stage; it's about a servant leader who fixes the big things."

The former Florida governor had picked the right state to make his case.

## A Candidate Needs Broad Appeal

It might seem to the traditional Republican leadership that voters are going crazy, giving a large slice of their support to two candidates — Donald Trump and Ben Carson. Both are political outsiders who want to smash the traditional system.

Before either one can get to the general election, they will have to run in a primary election against other Republicans. The winner is nominated — or picked — by Republican voters to run against the winner of the Democratic primaries.

Since 1980, South Carolina voters have a near-perfect record of picking the Republican Party's nominee. To win South Carolina, home of the first presidential vote in the South, a candidate has to appeal to many different kinds of Republicans.

In South Carolina, there are God-guns-and-guts conservative Republicans in the hill country upstate. These are religious Christians who think people should be allowed to own guns. In general, conservatives support old-fashioned values and traditional ways of doing things. Yet, there are also business people in places like Greenville, which is thriving because foreign companies such as BMW have opened factories there. In the low country, along the southern coast of South Carolina, Republicans tend to be conservative about money. However, they tend to be moderate about social issues, as many are hunters and fishermen interested in preserving nature.

Finally, the military has major bases in the state, and 400,000 veterans have settled there.

## They Want To Pick A Winner

State Republican Chairman Matt Moore said South Carolina Republicans are representative of the entire party.

In the 2012 election, opinion polls found that the Republican Party in South Carolina is balanced. A total of 36 percent identified themselves as "very conservative," while 32 percent said they were only "somewhat" conservative." The remaining 32 percent said they were moderate or liberal.

"A lot of Republicans here are concerned about electability," Moore said. "It's not enough to cast a protest vote, and it's not enough to show you're angry at Washington. They want to elect a president."

Ken Wezl of Florence, waiting in the restaurant to hear from Bush, thinks Bush would be "a good president." Wezl added that he worries that his brother, former President George W. Bush "would hurt him in the fall."

Wezl also likes Florida Senator Marco Rubio. "People are falling toward Rubio because the way he articulates his message and how he looks," said Wezl, a retired owner of a construction firm. "You can picture him up there against the Democrats; he's presidential." Yet he is concerned that the 43-year-old senator, who is still in his first term, might not have enough experience, leading to "another Obama." President Barack Obama was a senator only four years before becoming president.

Wezl's wife, Karen, wants to vote for Jeb Bush. "There's something about him, though; I'm not sold on him yet," she said. "Sometimes I don't think he wants it."

## Other Candidates Attract Attention

In Spartanburg, Ron Pockette was at the Beacon Drive-In checking out Ohio Governor John Kasich. He likes that Kasich is blunt and admires his work toward a balanced budget as a leader of the House of Representatives in the 1990s. A balanced budget is when the government does not spend more than it takes in through taxes.

"He has lots of experience in Washington and in running a state, and he sounds strong, like he'll push his ideas forward," said Pockette, a retired nurse and Navy veteran. "He has a proven track record."

He won't vote for Trump, although he said the businessman keeps him entertained. "I like to hear him go off, but the guy can't carry the load," Pockette said.

Right now, Trump is leading in South Carolina with 25 percent support, according to the RealClearPolitics average of polls in the state. Carson is running second, with 22 percent. Rubio has the support of 11 percent of Republicans in South Carolina, and 7.5 percent support Bush.

Jim Drury was at a Trump campaign event in Spartanburg last week. "We do need to make America great again," said Drury, a retired firefighter from Union, South Carolina, who grew up in York, Pennsylvania.

"We are losing everything. We're losing the war on terrorism, we're losing our jobs," he said.
