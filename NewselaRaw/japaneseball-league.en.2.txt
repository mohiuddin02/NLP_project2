LOS ANGELES, Calif. â€” At just 5-foot-3, Lauren Saiki was sometimes the smallest player on the basketball court. Yet her powerful playing sent her and her high school teammates to four playoffs in a row.

Also, Saiki, age 18, has earned a basketball scholarship to West Virginia University.

For all this, she can thank the skills she learned in a Japanese-American basketball league.

"That helped build my foundation," Saiki said. "I really fell in love with basketball."

The Asian leagues have been the starting point for many successful high school and college players. It has been especially important for young women.

## They May Be Short But They Play Tall

Keppel is a strong team, even though the average height of its players is usually less than 5-foot-5. All but one of the girls on the school's team last season played in a Japanese-American basketball league. Three of Saiki's teammates have played basketball with her since they were 5.

There are several thousand youth and adult players in Asian leagues in California. There are bowling, baseball, volleyball leagues, but none of them are as popular as basketball.

Teams come from a variety of organizations, including clubs, Buddhist temples and community centers. In fact, there are so many young players that a few Japanese-American churches in Los Angeles canceled Sunday school classes.

"Right now, it seems like basketball is the only thing that holds the community together," said George Imamura. He used to be the president of the South Bay F.O.R. Junior Sports Association, the largest Japanese-American basketball organization in Southern California. "That's why I think it's so important that if that's all we have right now, to keep it going."

## A Long Line Of Tiger Athletes

On a Sunday morning in the spring, Claire Sugiyama was in the Alhambra High School gym bleachers. She sat with about a dozen parents and grandparents to watch her daughter, Sarah, play with the Tigerettes Pulelehua sixth-grade team.

Sarah comes from a long line of Tigers. Her grandfather was a founder of the Tigers Youth Club, and her father, who coaches the team, also played basketball with the organization.

"He just felt she needed to play with Tigers," Claire Sugiyama said. "She was born with stripes."

The Japanese American Optimist Club girls' league began about 50 years ago. It gave children of Japanese-American families the opportunity to play basketball at a time when they were not allowed to play elsewhere, said Leland Lau, league commissioner. When he became the head of the league about 20 years ago, there were about 50 girls' teams. Today, there are nearly 130.

The leagues' success in getting girls onto high school teams has even attracted non-Asian players, Lau said.

## Stiff Competition But Great Rewards

Competition on the Japanese-American teams can be fierce, said Kiki Yang. She is a star player at Pasadena's Polytechnic School and three-time winner of the league's most-valuable-player award.

"It gave me more confidence," she said. "It exposes you to the sport and allows you to make friends from different schools."

Kayla Sato, 17, said the skills she learned in Japanese-American basketball have been important.

"This community is like a family," Sato said. "Through one connection, there were so many doors."

Basketball is a sport that generally attracts tall players. However, the lack of height has not been an obstacle for the Japanese-American girls, Lau said.

Confidence is key, said Monica Hang. She played in the leagues and is now coach of the Los Angeles Valley College women's basketball team.

"It taught me how to be 5-foot-2 and play as if I was 6-foot-2," she said.

## Good Foundation For The Future

That confidence will be important for Saiki as she heads 2,500 miles away to West Virginia.

"I'm nervous because it's big-time basketball, but I'm pretty excited because it's a great experience," she said. "I'm going to meet a lot of different people and have different experiences than what I've had growing up on the West Coast."

First she'll have to graduate from high school and say goodbye to her teammates. They grew up together.

"It's going to be a bittersweet moment, of course," Saiki said. "I'll probably stay in touch with them a lot."
