In 1996 the bones of an ancient man were found in Washington state.

We did not know who his relatives were. Now we know he was an early American. Scientists call him Kennewick Man. They believe he died about 8,500 years ago.

The scientists studied the DNA of Kennewick Man to learn more about him. DNA contains the information that tells the body how to grow and work. It is the body's instruction manual. DNA is passed on from parents to children.

## A Tug Of War To Study The Bones

Scientists recently made an announcement about Kennewick Man. They said DNA shows that he is related to the Native Americans living today.

Many people did not agree where the ancient man was originally from.

When they first found him, scientists wanted to study the bones to learn more about the early Americans. Native Americans in the Northwest United States were not happy about that. They did not want anyone touching the bones. A law was passed in 1990 that said Native American remains on U.S. lands must be returned to their tribes. The two sides went to court to decide.

But scientists were not sure that Kennewick Man was a Native American. They said he looked like people from Japan and Polynesia. In 2004, the tribes lost the case. Scientists continued to work on the bones.

## We Have A DNA Match

Morten Rasmussen is a scientist at the Stanford School of Medicine. He says they tried to study Kennewick Man's DNA in the 1990s. They did not learn anything new.

They were able to learn more now because technology is better. It has become easier to study DNA from old skeletons.

The scientists found Kennewick Man's DNA in just a tiny piece of bone from his hand. They looked at his DNA beside DNA of people from Asia and the Americas. They also looked at DNA from the Colville tribe. This was one of the Native American groups that had claimed the remains.

Rasmussen said the results of the tests were clear. Kennewick Man "shares by far the most with other Native Americans," he said.

An author of the study said the Colville tribe was "pretty excited" with the discovery.
