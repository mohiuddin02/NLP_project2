WASHINGTON â€” He was a high school dropout, sometime junior college student and failed Army recruit.

But Edward Joseph Snowden found his calling in America's spy services, using his computer skills to rise from a lowly security position to life as a well-paid private contractor for the National Security Agency. At age 29, he rented a bungalow with his girlfriend north of Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, and claimed to earn $200,000 a year.

On Monday, hours after he admitted disclosing a trove of intelligence secrets to the media, Snowden checked out of the glitzy Mira Hotel in Hong Kong, where he had holed up for weeks, and dropped out of sight.

The secrets included the government's tracking of information about the date and duration and telephone numbers of domestic phone calls made, as well as a program to gather Internet usage information.

Whether he has gone into hiding, is seeking asylum with a sympathetic govennment, or been taken into custody by U.S. or Chinese authorities, is unclear.

## Disclosures Spur Security Vs. Privacy Debate

Also unclear is how the American public will view Snowden's actions. Before fleeing, Snowden gave a 12-minute videotaped interview to _The Guardian_, the British newspaper that broke many of his disclosures. In a soft-spoken voice, he said he was determined to shine a light on what he called the federal government's almost unlimited tracking of private citizens' phone calls and Internet usage.

Daniel Ellsberg, who in the 1970s leaked to the _New York Times_  a secret report about how the U.S. government misled the public about the Vietnam War, told the Associated Press that Snowden's disclosures were the "most significant" in the nation's history.

"What he was looking at and what he told us about was the form of behavior, the practice of policy, that's blatantly unconstitutional," Ellsberg said.

But others say that what Snowden did could hurt the U.S. war on terror, and was illegal.

"I don't look at this as being a whistle-blower. I think it's an act of treason," U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters. Other lawmakers have voiced similar sentiments.

On Tuesday, the American Civil Liberties Union sued the Obama administration, saying that the telephone data collection program was illegal. It asked a judge to stop the program and get rid of the records.

## Security First, Poll Shows

So far, public opinion has come down on the side of preventing terrorism, rather than preserving privacy, according to a poll by the Pew Research Center and the _Washington Post_.

When asked a question that pitted investigating possible terror threats versus protecting personal privacy, almost two-thirds of those polled said the priority was investigating the threats. Younger Americans were more likely to favor privacy, but even a slight majority of people under 30 still came out for investigation first, privacy second.

Snowden definitely chose the side of privacy first.

"I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded," he said.

Snowden's world began in Elizabeth City, N.C. His family soon moved to Ellicott City, a Baltimore suburb near NSA's vast headquarters at Fort Meade. He told the _Guardian_ that he struggled in high school, eventually dropping out. A neighbor, Joyce Kinsey, recalled him as a quiet boy who often was on his computer.

His parents are divorced. His father, Lonnie Snowden, was an officer in the U.S. Coast Guard, according to public records, and lives in Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley, part of the old Rust Belt north of Philadelphia. His mother, Elizabeth Snowden, is chief deputy clerk in charge of administration and information technology at the U.S. District Court in Baltimore.

Two people who identified themselves as FBI agents visited the home of Snowden's father and stepmother Monday afternoon in Pennsylvania. Lonnie Snowden told _ABC News_ that he last saw his son months ago for dinner and that they parted with a hug.

A spokeswoman for Anne Arundel Community College in Arnold, Md., said an Edward Joseph Snowden took classes there intermittently from 1999, when Snowden was about 15, through the fall of 2005. He earned a high school equivalency degree, but did not get a college degree or certificate.

## From Army To Intelligence

In May 2004, Snowden enlisted in the Army, hoping to join the Special Forces. He reported to Fort Benning, Ga., but was discharged four months later, the Army said Monday.

Snowden told the Guardian that he left the Army after he broke both legs in a training accident.

The following year, Snowden got his start in intelligence by landing a job as a "security specialist" at the Center for the Advanced Study of Languages at the University of Maryland. The center, run by the NSA, is "dedicated to addressing the language needs of the intelligence community," according to a university website.

After that, Snowden said, his computer skills helped him get a job with the CIA.

In 2007, he said, the CIA sent him to Geneva for two years to maintain security for the CIA's computer network. The CIA considers Geneva an important spying base because it hosts so many foreign diplomats and financial institutions.

Snowden said he began to grow disillusioned with the CIA while in Switzerland. He claimed that CIA officers deliberately got a Swiss banker drunk, and then offered to fix his drunken-driving arrest if he agreed to disclose secret financial information. He didn't say if the banker agreed.

"I realized that I was part of something that was doing far more harm than good," he said.

Still, Snowden continued to move up the ranks in the intelligence community. His high-level security clearance made him easily employable in the private sector, and in 2009, he said, he left the CIA to work as a contractor at an NSA facility on a military base in Japan.

That's when he first saw the astonishing breadth of the cyber-agency's surveillance capabilities, he said.

## A Civil Liberties Proponent

Snowden became a firm proponent of civil liberties, affixing a sticker to his laptop promoting the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which advocates for Internet users' rights.

In 2012 he made two contributions totaling $500 to the presidential campaign of Ron Paul, the libertarian Republican congressman from Texas, according to federal records. Snowden listed his employer as Dell, the Texas-based computer company. A Dell spokeswoman declined to answer questions Monday about Snowden's employment.

Sometime that year, Snowden moved to Honolulu. Last March, he took a job with Booz Allen Hamilton, a government contractor, as an infrastructure analyst at the NSA's huge mountaintop facility on Oahu. He rented a single-story blue bungalow in Waipahu, an upscale suburb 10 miles from the NSA facility.

Booz Allen said Tuesday that it had fired Edward Snowden "for violations of the firm's code of ethics and firm policy."
