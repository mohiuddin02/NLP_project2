A white high school student named Abigail Fisher applied to the University of Texas at Austin in 2008. When she did not get in, she filed a lawsuit against the school, claiming she was the victim of discrimination. Last week, the case went before the Supreme Court of the United States.

One group of social media users do not feel sorry for Fisher. They have started posting messages online with the label "#StayMadAbby."

At the heart of Fisher's lawsuit is something called affirmative action. Schools and universities with affirmative action policies consider race as a factor when deciding who to accept to their programs. Groups that have been traditionally treated unfairly, like African-Americans and Latinos, are given preference in some cases.

## Affirmative Action Is Controversial

The University of Texas (UT) at Austin is one of many American universities that uses affirmative action. When Fisher, who is white, was rejected from the school, she felt she had been treated unfairly and decided to sue the school, claiming she was discriminated against.  

Affirmative action has always been controversial. Some, like Fisher, believe the policy is unfair because it gives some people advantages because of their race. Others, however, believe racism in America continues to create unfair obstacles for people of color. Affirmative action does not give people of color unfair advantages, they argue. Rather, it helps balance out the disadvantages minority groups face. 

Also, some people say affirmative action at colleges and universities helps make sure classes include students of all races. This makes college a better experience for everyone, they believe. 

## Lawsuit Argues Student Was Treated Unfairly

Fisher's lawsuit claims she was unfairly treated by UT Austin. She says she deserved to go to the school more than some of the African-American students who got in instead of her. 

In response, many African-American students and former students have expressed their disagreement online. They have been using social media to make fun of Fisher and express pride about their academic achievements. 

On the website Twitter, "#StayMadAbby" has become a popular hashtag. Twitter is a social media site where people can post short messages. A hashtag is a label that links posts together. 

One recent post included a photo of a group of African-American women in caps and gowns celebrating their graduation. Below the photo were the words: "Simply amazing, beautiful, intelligent BLACK WOMEN. '#StayMadAbby.'"

Another post teased, "How you gon' hate from outside the school? You can't even get in! '#StayMadAbby.'"

## Critics Doubt Fisher's Claims

Others on Twitter criticized the suggestion that African-Americans only get into college because of affirmative action. Several students posted the grades and degrees they had earned. By showing off their success at college, they seemed to shoot down the idea that they did not deserve to get in.

Online commenters also cast doubt on Fisher's claim that affirmative action was the reasons she did not get in to UT Austin. In Fisher's year, the school accepted 47 students with grades and test scores lower than hers. Forty-two of these students were white. 

There were also many students of color who, like Fisher, got turned down by UT Austin. In Fisher's year, 168 African-American and Hispanic students were rejected who had grades and test scores as good as or better than Fisher's.

## Advocate Says Fisher Was A Victim Of Discrimination

Edward Blum runs a nonprofit organization that is funding Fisher's lawsuit. He acknowledged that some white students with lower grades than Fisher's were admitted to UT Austin the year she applied. However, he said this did not prove she was not the victim of discrimination. 

The Supreme Court appeared to be divided last Wednesday as the justices heard arguments from both sides of the case. It was the first time the court heard a case about affirmative action since 2003. That year, it ruled the University of Michigan's Law School affirmative action policy was legal. 

As the court discussed the case on Wednesday, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia made a statement that offended some people. He suggested African-American students who benefit from affirmative action should instead go to "slower-track" schools.

No one knows how the court will rule in Fisher's case. If UT Austin's policy is not upheld, the decision could put an end to affirmative action at colleges and universities across the country.
