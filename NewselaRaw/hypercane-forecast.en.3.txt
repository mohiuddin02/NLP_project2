The nation recently focused its attention on remembering Hurricane Katrina. It was the worst hurricane in U.S. history. It happened 10 years ago and hit the Gulf Coast. Still, it was not the worst hurricane that could have hit New Orleans, Louisiana, which suffered terrible damage.

A new study shows that hurricanes could get even worse. The study was done by scientists Ning Lin and Kerry Emanuel. They looked at possible storms in Tampa, Florida; Cairns, Australia; and Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Hurricanes much worse than ever seen could hit those cities.

The chances of the storms happening are very small. In some cases, they might only happen once every 10,000 years.

## Scientists Wanted To Show Super Storms' Power

Emanuel said the scientists did the study to make people aware of what a terrible hurricane would look like, even if it were not likely to happen. A special computer program showed what the storms would look like. The program looked at both hurricane patterns and what is expected to happen with global warming, the heating up of the Earth's climate.

The computer came up with hundreds of thousands of possible hurricanes. The computer model showed that "you're going to see hurricanes that are unlike anything you've seen in history," said Emanuel. He developed math equations that show how strong a hurricane can be. He said that a hurricane with winds near 500 mph is possible if an asteroid hits the Earth. Hurricanes start over warm water and an asteroid could really heat up ocean waters. Emanuel called this a "hypercane."

What did the scientists learn? Let's take Tampa Bay. It hasn't been hit by a major hurricane since 1921. That storm caused 3- to 3.5-meter, or 10- to 11-foot, floods on the coast. Such coastal floods are called storm surges.

## Florida's Shallow Waters Put Tampa Bay In Danger

Why is Tampa Bay in such danger? The water on Florida's east coast is very deep. Yet on Florida's west coast it is far more shallow.

Surges from shallow water can be much larger, Emanuel said. Surges can also be bigger when they move into a bay, a body of water cut into land that opens to the sea.

The new computer model showed the scientists that an even worse storm is possible. It is especially possible with sea levels rising from global warming. Scientists looked at 2,100 possible Tampa Bay hurricanes in the current climate. Then they looked at other possible hurricane situations. They looked at what would happen if the Earth continues to get warmer.

In the current climate, the study found that a 19-foot storm surge is possible in a strong hurricane. Such a hurricane would follow a path like the 1921 storm.

However, an even worse hurricane could happen. If global warming increased greatly by the end of this century, it could cause a storm that moved on a different path. The storm could move north along Florida's Gulf Coast. Then it would turn at Tampa. That storm could cause a surge of nearly 37 feet.

## Global Warming Could Lead To Higher Storm Surges

The study also showed that global warming makes the worst possible surges more likely.

In Cairns, Australia, the study showed an 18-foot storm surge is possible even in today's climate. It also suggests that an extremely powerful hurricane could happen in the Persian Gulf. That area has never had a hurricane.

The waters in the Persian Gulf are very hot. All that heat means there is a lot of energy for a possible hurricane. Hurricanes start in warm water areas. They get their energy from evaporating water coming off the ocean. The atmosphere there is normally too dry for hurricanes, Emanuel explained. Still, one could happen, he said.

The study said a hurricane with winds of over 250 mph was possible though not very likely. The hurricane would cause a storm surge of 24 feet in Dubai. The hurricane would be stronger than anything ever seen on Earth.
