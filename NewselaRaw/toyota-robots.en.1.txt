TOKYO, Japan â€” Toyota Motor Corp. has big ambitions to become a significant player in the growing market for robots that can help the elderly and other people in everyday life.

The company believes it can use its manufacturing expertise to become as crucial in a field it calls "partner robots" as it is to auto-making. Toyota currently employs only 150 robotics engineers out of a worldwide staff of 300,000. But it is putting money into robotic research and development.

Toyota last month announced a $1 billion investment in a company headed by a robotics expert in Silicon Valley to develop artificial intelligence and robotics. It is already working with Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on robotics.

"We are preparing for a future in which people may not be able to drive cars, or they may need artificial intelligence to support them to drive," said Akifumi Tamaoki, the general manager of Toyota's partner robot division. "And once they get off their cars they may need help from partner robots."

## Japanese Population Aging Rapidly

The Japanese government is counting on the robotics industry growing as the country ages at a faster pace than any other industrialized nation. Other companies have jumped in, including Internet company Softbank Corp. The company is selling a humanoid robot that carries on simple conversations.

Tamaoki said Toyota's interest in robotics goes back decades, and the company uses them on the assembly line at its auto plants. But it now sees the technology as a potentially successful business in its own right.

Some of that impetus comes from the focus of the auto and tech industries on using artificial intelligence to develop cars that can drive by themselves. Google Inc. is testing driverless vehicles. Also, Toyota's Japanese rival Nissan Motor Co. is especially confident about the technology, with plans to start selling such vehicles by 2020.

## Honda's Robot Not Useful Enough

Honda Motor Co. was a leader in robots with its Asimo walking and talking child-shaped robot, which took two decades to develop. But critics say that effort got sidetracked by focusing too much on duplicating human movements and behavior, and lost sight of trying to be useful.

Honda officials acknowledge that the company went through soul-searching after it was publicly criticized. The Asimo could do nothing to help people after the March 2011 nuclear disaster in Japan.

Toyota demonstrated a one-armed partner robot on wheels, loaded with sensors and cameras, earlier this year. The HSR, or Human Support Robot, looks a bit like R2-D2 from "Star Wars." It can pick up after people, bring an item to the bedside or open curtains.

## Robot Can't Talk Yet

The robot, an improved version of a model first shown in 2012, is not yet for sale to the public. Toyota is collaborating with 10 universities in Japan to develop practical uses, Tamaoki said. The company plans to start working with academic organizations overseas next year.

Tamaoki believes robots like HSR will gradually become widespread, although that may take another decade.

Toyota is planning to add another arm to HSR, which will allow it to perform more complex tasks, as well give it conversational skills. The robot now comes with a flat panel that works like a videophone or video player, but it can't talk.

One research group has proposed using it for taking care of pets, such as jiggling a toy for a lonely cat, according to Toyota.
