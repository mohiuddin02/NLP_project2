BAKER, Nev. — What does the National Park Service do when America's caves need a cleaning? They hold a Lint Camp.

Paul Kemp and his 14-year-old son, Simon, are from Sandy, Utah. They have joined the clean-up crew at the Lehman Cave in Nevada. It is quiet in the cave, deep inside the earth. Light from Paul Kemp's headlamp cuts through the shadows. Father and son will clean, wipe, dust and pick lint from rock formations in the cave.

Some rock formations hang from the roof of the cave and look like icicles. Others grow from the floor and look like tall towers. Some formations even look like popcorn.

## Lint Is Everywhere

Kemp, who is 67, used to be a rocket engineer. He uses his tiny brush to clean the dirt and fluffy lint from the rocks.

"These formations are terrible. They're simply covered with dust," he says. He puts the dust and lint in a plastic bag.

The lint builds up because of people. The cave gets 28,000 visitors a year and they leave thread, hair, skin cells and dust behind.

It is a cool 52 degrees inside the mostly silent cave. It is full of strange shapes and shadows. Kemp hops up on top of a rock shelf to better reach a group of rock formations.

Each year, people who explore caves for fun come together. They are known as cavers and they meet to clean the caves.

## The Cave Has A History

The Lehman Cave in Nevada is part of Great Basin National Park. The park lies between Las Vegas and Salt Lake City. Absalom Lehman was a miner who found the cave in 1885. But many believe Native Americans used it ages before that.

The cave is 2 miles long and 200 feet below ground at its lowest point. It became a national monument in 1922.

Lehman Cave was not always protected by the government. Absalom Lehman gave candlelight tours to visitors. Long ago, it was also used as a secret bar and a dance floor. Another time walls were broken through to make a new exit.

## Trash In, Trash Out

The Lint Camp was held for three days. Two dozen cavers from three states worked in the cave. They took out a lot of trash.

Visitors cannot touch the formations. Even so, threads from their clothes, as well as hair and skin get left behind.

Ben Roberts is the park's chief. He calls lint a human problem that humans must clean up. He says, "it is just like any camping trip — if you pack it in, you pack it out."

It's a Friday morning and just eight cavers have arrived. Roberts leads some cavers for important repair work. They wear miner's helmets and carry large cans filled with brushes, gloves and tools to pick up lint.

## Lint-Picker Rules

"Lint pickers follow me," park official Gretchen Baker says to the rest.

Park workers explain the rules: Do not touch anything without gloves. The rock formations grow about an inch in 100 years. Oils from human skin can affect their growth. No food is allowed. One dropped crumb can lead to bacteria, or germs. The bacteria could harm the formations.

Baker's group starts slowly, scared to touch the rock.

Randi Poer is a caver from California. "How clean do I need to make this?" she asks.

"Just the major stuff," Baker says.

Poer brushes off the lint. The rock formations are no longer dull. They begin to sparkle.
