WASHINGTON â€“ Every day, 80 to 120 children cross the Texas border illegally - and alone. Nationally, illegal immigration by children younger than 18 is on the rise, even as fewer adults come into the country without permission.

The Border Patrol caught 24,481 unaccompanied children in 2012, more than three times as many as in 2008. Of that total, federal authorities sent a record 13,625 children to another part of the federal government, called the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR). This agency is responsible for taking care of minors while immigration officials decide their cases.

Most of them are teenagers. They are temporarily cared for by the federal government in shelters and group homes in more than a dozen states. The federal government foots the bill, but states feel the impact. Last year, Republican Gov. Rick Perry of Texas called the surge of children crossing the border a "humanitarian crisis."

Most of the children who remain in U.S. custody are from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. Many say they are fleeing violence from gangs and the illegal drug trade as well as abuse, sometimes by their own family members. Others are trying to break free from poverty and get a better life in the United States. Or they are trying to reunite with family members already in the states. In many cases, they crossed mountains and deserts, often relying on "coyotes," or guides, to get to the United States.

## Surging Numbers

Whatever the reason, the increase has been dramatic. In a typical year, federal authorities handled between 7,000 and 8,000 unaccompanied children. The total was 13,625 in 2012. The government estimates it could climb to nearly 24,000 within the next year.

Providing temporary shelter and support services to these children while their cases work through the maze of the immigration and legal system is not cheap. The growing cost of the program also comes at a time when Congress is looking to improve the country's immigration laws. States are also taking a fresh look at their own policies toward immigrants.

At one point last year, the federal government used military bases in Texas to temporarily house the overflow of unaccompanied children in its care.

Advocates say the federal government worked around the clock last year to open several emergency shelters to move these children from holding facilities. The temporary shelters are now gone, replaced with an additional 1,300 beds in licensed homes and other buildings, primarily in Texas.

## Allowed To Stay

The state no longer has crowding problems after some buildings were expanded and new ones were built, said Patrick Crimmins, a state spokesman.

A decade ago, the United States would have routinely tried to deport the unaccompanied children, arguing they were violating U.S. immigration laws. New laws passed after 9/11 gave ORR the responsibility for caring for and placing these children.

The shelters where the children are temporarily housed are considered better than the federal immigration detention centers. The kids in the shelters get to wear jeans and T-shirts, not the jumpsuits worn by many adults in federal immigration centers. Children under 12 years old are placed in smaller residential-type centers. Education and medical services are provided.

"But it's still a shelter," said Jessica Jones with the Women's Refugee Commission. "It's not an ideal scenario."

## "Feels Like Detention"

Many shelters are not in neighborhoods, lack outdoor recreation areas and many are not equipped to deal with the problems the children may have suffered getting to the United States. "It still feels like detention to them," she said.

Most of the children end up staying here. ORR data show that more than 65 percent of these children from 2008 to 2010 were ultimately placed with sponsors living in the United States. Sponsors ideally are family, but also included are licensed programs willing to accept legal custody of a child, such as shelters for homeless youth.

About 40 percent of children placed into ORR custody receive some form of legal relief.  They may get special visas if they were victims of crime, or were forced to come to the United States by traffickers who want to take advantage of them through forced labor.

With so many children in the system, advocates worry the government is not paying enough attention to the sponsors. The government must ensure that the family members or family friends can take care of these children properly and that the home is suitable. There is also a concern that some children are being released to people who claim to be the parents but are not.

ORR also is not required to do background checks or a "home study" that includes home visits for every sponsor.

"A sponsor is just part of the equation," said Kristyn Peck, associate director of children's services at the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. "Assessing the home environment is equally important."

Once the children are placed with sponsors, the federal government often loses track of them. "No one really knows what is happening to these children. When these children are released to these family members, there is very limited support for them," said Kimberly Haynes, director of children's services for the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service.
