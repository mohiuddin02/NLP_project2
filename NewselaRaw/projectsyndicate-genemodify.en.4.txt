NEW YORK, N.Y. – Genes make us who we are. They make us look a certain way. For example, there is a gene for red hair. 

Genes can also cause serious problems. 

Genes are inherited, or passed down from parent to child. That is why we look like our parents. 

Unfortunately, we also sometimes inherit harmful genes. These can make us more likely to become sick.

## Changing Out Harmful Genes

For years people believed there was nothing we could do about harmful genes. We were just stuck with them.

All that is changing very quickly. Scientists will soon be able to remove or change our genes. 

A new tool is already being used to change the genes of insects and animals. Changing genes is known as gene editing.

The new tool is called CRISPR. It lets scientists easily remove and add genes. Soon it will be used on people. Scientists may be able to get rid of many terrible inherited illnesses.

## Concerns About Gene Editing

Still, some people are worried. They say there could be serious problems ahead. 

One thing people are worried about is safety. There is no need for that worry, though. Tests show that CRISPR is safe.

People are also concerned about fairness. Gene editing may cost quite a bit of money. Perhaps only the rich will be able to pay for it.

People are right to worry about such unfairness. Still, it will not stop doctors from going ahead.

Some also think that gene editing might used for the wrong reasons. Parents may want doctors to make them perfect children. They may pay to get smarter, stronger or better looking kids. 

## Putting Protections In Place

Such changes may not be a good idea. Perhaps CRISPR should only be used to keep people from getting sick.

Some people want to block the use of CRISPR. They are not thinking correctly.

Yes, there are real problems. The chances for good are greater than these problems, though. Gene editing could get rid of many terrible illnesses.

CRISPR should be used, and it will be. We should try to make sure it will be used safely. We should make sure it is not only for the rich.

Soon some doctors will begin promising to give us superchildren. They will offer to make our children taller, smarter and stronger. We need to decide now if such changes are worth making.
