LOS ANGELES, Calif. — California is in the middle of a terrible drought. Water is getting very scarce and people there are worried.

Experts believe they know a way to help the thirsty state come up with more water.

There is one big problem, though: Many people find the plan disgusting. When they hear about it, the first word out of their mouth is "yuck!"

Water use experts are pushing for something known as direct potable reuse. The word "potable"  means drinkable.

The idea is to reuse wastewater, also known as sewage. Wastewater is water that has been made undrinkable because something has been dumped into it. When we go to the bathroom, the water that is flushed away becomes wastewater.

Simply put, wastewater has a lot of poop and other unhealthy stuff in it.

Experts say such sewage can be carefully cleaned. Then, it can be reused as perfectly safe drinking water.

## "Toilet To Tap" Plans Have Failed In California

The idea of drinking "toilet water" makes some people want to throw up. However, cleaned sewage has been reused as drinking water for years in Namibia in Africa. More recently, several Texas cities have started doing the same thing.

In California, such plans have been blocked whenever they come up.

A cartoon helped turn people against the idea in San Diego back in 1994. It shows a dog drinking from a toilet bowl. A man next to him orders the animal to "move over" so he can drink too.

In Los Angeles in 2000, people fighting against potable reuse began calling it the "toilet to tap" system. The name stuck. In the end, plans to try potable reuse in Los Angeles were dropped.

Still, supporters are now pushing the idea again. They say the time has finally come for Californians to accept direct potable reuse. The idea just makes sense now that water is so scarce, they say. It particularly makes sense for large coastal cities such as Los Angeles.

## Drought Might Be Changing People's Minds

Coastal cities pour billions of gallons of sewage into the Pacific Ocean each year. They could save that wastewater instead, supporters of reuse say. It could be cleaned and turned into drinking water.

Tim Quinn heads the Association of California Water Agencies. "That water is discharged into the ocean and lost forever," he said. "Yet it's probably the single largest source of water supply for California over the next quarter-century."

California's severe drought might finally be changing people's minds.

Donald Schultz was a leader in the effort to stop reuse in Los Angeles. Now, he says he might consider a new plan.

"You know, toilet to tap might be the only answer at this point," said Schultz.

## Wastewater Would Be Cleaned Many Times

Water expert and college professor George Tchobanoglous strongly supports potable reuse. By 2020, it could supply up to 1.1 million acre-feet of water annually, he said. The water would be enough to supply 1 in 5 Californians, or around 8 million people.

Potable reuse is nothing to worry about, supporters say. Wastewater is cleaned many times and very carefully before it is declared ready to drink. All disease-causing bacteria and other dangerous and disgusting things are removed.

In fact, the wastewater ends up cleaner than most bottled waters, supporters say.

## Critics Say Wastewater Can Never Be Clean Enough

Those who are against potable reuse do not agree. They believe that even the most careful cleaning will not get rid of all the harmful things found in wastewater.

"Personally I would not drink water that has been recycled through the toilet to tap process," said scientist Steven Oppenheimer. However, Oppenheimer said he would use such water for cleaning and even bathing.

Allison Chan is an expert on potable reuse projects. She says many people become more supportive of such programs as they learn more about them. However, the opposite is true for others — they become even more strongly against the idea.

"This just goes to show how the yuck factor can stick with some people," Chan said.
