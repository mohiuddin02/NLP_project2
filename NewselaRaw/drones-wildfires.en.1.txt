SAN DIEGO, Calif. — As Jason Thrasher lowered his firefighting helicopter, he saw what he thought was another chopper battling a blaze that was threatening homes.

The pilot for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection suddenly identified the object as a drone only 10 feet from his windshield. The unmanned aircraft forced him to make a hard left to avoid a collision about 500 feet above ground, according to a report he filed the next day.

"If that drone came through my windshield, I have no idea what could have happened," Thrasher said. "If that drone hits my tail rotor, for sure it's going to be catastrophic."

The near-miss in September in Nevada City, California, explains why drones have quickly become a serious nuisance and concern for firefighting pilots and other first responders. The many close calls have fueled demands for more oversight and self-policing in the skies.

## Forest Service Says Interference Is On The Rise

The U.S. Forest Service has tallied 13 wildfires in which drones are suspected of interfering with firefighting aircraft this year — 11 since late June. Drones got in the way of only four fires last year and only scattered incidents before. Last month, the sighting of five drones in a wildfire that closed an expressway in Southern California and destroyed numerous vehicles grounded crews for 20 minutes as flames spread.

Firefighting agencies have introduced public service announcements to warn drone owners. Meanwhile, lawmakers are seeking stiffer penalties for interfering with firefighting.

"When you can't support firefighters on the ground, fires get bigger," said Ken Pimlott, director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. "It's significant, and it's a huge issue."

On Aug. 2, for the second time in three days, a commercial pilot reported a drone while approaching John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City, New York. On Aug. 9, four commercial flights between 2,000 and 3,000 feet in the air spotted a drone while preparing for landing at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey. On Aug. 4, as flames swept through a Vietnamese restaurant in San Diego, the local Fire Department pleaded with drone operators to leave the area. It tweeted, "You are interfering with fire operations."

## Lower Drone Prices May Be To Blame

A simple explanation for the growing number of encounters is that consumer drones have become more common as prices fall. The Consumer Electronics Association predicts sales in the United States will reach 700,000 this year, up from 430,000 last year and 128,000 in 2013. The industry group estimates this year's average price for a drone is $149, down from $160 last year and $349 in 2013. <img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/drones_english.png" />

Last month, 20 members of Congress from California had a request for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). They asked it to consider requiring drone makers to include technology that prevents operators from interfering with firefighters. One bill in the California Legislature would raise fines and introduce jail time for anyone who impedes firefighters. Another would grant immunity to first responders who destroy interfering drones.

Greg McNeal, a Pepperdine University law professor, likens worries about safety and ethical boundaries to concerns years ago about people taking cellphone pictures in locker rooms and other public places. Governments are wrestling with how to regulate a new consumer technology that can create havoc when misused.

Most drone operators who flew near wildfires were probably unaware of the dangers, said McNeal. Others are "straight reckless," he said, perhaps motivated to get images of fires in order to sell them.

## Drone Sightings Reported At Wildfires In 5 States

The U.S. Forest Service reported potential drone sightings this year in eight wildfires in California. There were two in Washington state and one each in Colorado, Minnesota and Utah.

On June 24 in San Bernardino, California, a plane trying to put out a fire came within about 500 feet of a drone. Another pilot soon came within the same distance of a second drone, forcing the grounding of four firefighting aircraft for 2 1/2 hours.

In Washington state, an airplane flying over a forest fire spotted a drone on July 11. Pat McCabe, a U.S. Forest Service supervisor seated next to the pilot, saw the drone land about three miles from the fire and get loaded into a SUV, whose driver sped away.

"The intelligence gathering stopped, and now our focus was on the drone," said McCabe.

The sighting occurred as firefighting aircraft were scheduled to stop for the day. If it was earlier, McCabe said those planes and helicopters would have been grounded.

In Milford, California on June 29, a drone appeared about 200 feet from the left wing of a reconnaissance aircraft. The firefighter pilot, who was about 1,500 feet above ground, left the area and was ordered to return to base.

## Restrictions Can't Keep Up With Raging Fires' Spread

Under FAA guidelines, drone operators should fly no higher than 400 feet, stay clear of stadiums and people, and avoid flying within 5 miles of airports. During wildfires and other emergencies, the FAA imposes temporary restrictions that ground drones.

Software can alert operators to FAA-restricted areas. But, some firefighting officials say, wildfires spread so quickly and unpredictably that there may be a dangerous lag before the temporary rules are in place.

The prospect of public shaming may be the best deterrent, said Jon Resnick, spokesman for SZ DJI Technology Co., one of the largest consumer drone makers.

"Technology can only do so much," he said. "At a certain point, common sense needs to take hold."
