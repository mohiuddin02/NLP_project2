FLINT, Mich. — Ariana Hawk's son is having skin problems. His name is Sincere Smith. He is 2 years old. The skin on his arms, leg and face is red and rough. Sincere's doctor told his mother not to use water out of the faucet to bathe him. There was a problem with that water.

So Hawk heated a bowl of bottled water. She dipped a cloth in the water. Then she wiped her son's itchy skin.

Sincere's skin problem started after the city of Flint switched its water supply in April 2014\. The city used to get water from Lake Huron. It decided to use water from the Flint River instead because it is cheaper. It also is poisoned with lead. Lead is a dangerous type of metal.

## Dirty Water And Metal Pipes

The lead got in the water through the metal pipes in the river. The lead was an accident. 

Hawk blames the water for Sincere's skin problem.

Other people in Flint also feel mad. Some stopped using the water after the change. They did not like its smell, color and taste. Others continued to drink and cook with it.

There are about 99,000 people in Flint. About 40,000 people are poor.

People in Flint feel worried, angry and sad. They are also scared.

Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha is a doctor in Flint. She said there is too much lead in children's blood. Lead can cause health problems, experts say. It can affect how smart a person is. Lead can cause problems with speech, learning and behavior. It hurts children more than adults.

## Government Offering Help

Rick Snyder is the governor of Michigan. On Jan. 5, he declared an emergency in Flint. President Barack Obama declared it a national emergency on Jan. 11\. He ordered the government to help. 

The state government is passing out free bottled water and testing kits in Flint. People picked up free water at fire stations. More was passed out door-to-door.

In October, Flint stopped using river water. It went back to Lake Huron water. People still do not want to drink it. The Flint River water ruined the pipes. The water may still be poisoned. 

Karen Weaver is the mayor of Flint. She said people do not trust the government anymore. Right now, the government must fix the water pipes. It also must help people with their health problems in the future, the mayor said.
