CHICAGO — Freshly made juices are supposed to be good for you. The people who sell them say they give you instant energy and lots of vitamins and minerals. They even make you lose weight, they say. And juices are tasty and easy to gulp down.

Lots of people who want to have a healthy diet seem to believe the claims. They buy gallons and gallons of juice. The drinks are so popular that juice-maker Jamba Juice had $55.1 million in sales in just 13 weeks.

Tools for juicing at home are also a big business. And more than 40 books about juice or smoothies have been released in the last 30 days alone on Amazon.com. Most mention health, weight loss or both in their titles.

But dietitians and nutrition scientists — experts who study food — say juice is far from the healthiest way to eat fruit. Nutrition professor Barry Popkin even calls its popularity dangerous.
## Fruit Juices Have No Fiber

Popkin and other experts wish people would eat whole fruit instead of drinking juice. Juicing removes fiber, which is one of the best parts of fruit. At the same time, juice contains huge amounts of sugar and calories. Calories provide the energy we need, but too many of them make us gain weight.

Studies show that people who drink juice regularly are more likely to gain weight, Popkin said. They are also more likely to develop certain diseases.

One 2010 study looked at people who drank two or more servings of fruit juice every week. It found that drinking that much juice was bad for their health. They had a 29 percent higher risk of developing one of the diseases, diabetes, than people who didn't drink juice regularly.

Unlike juices, smoothies do provide fiber. The entire fruit often goes into the blender. But smoothies still contain a lot of calories. Choosing a vegetable juice or smoothie is one way to lower the sugar.

Some experts do argue that juices have their benefits, though. Elizabeth Ward is a dietitian who works with Jamba Juice. She points out that juices contain lots of vitamins and minerals. That makes them better than drinks like sodas, she said.
## Too Much Sugar In Juice

But many dietitians say there is simply too much sugar in fruit juice. The sugar outweighs any benefit from the vitamins and minerals.

"Eating too much fruit can make us gain weight, just like eating too much candy," said dietitian Lara Field.

Another problem is that juicing removes the fiber that's in fruit. That means juice drinkers don't get the full health benefits of fruit, said dietitian Bethany Doerfler.

And not eating enough fiber is bad for your health, said food science professor Joanne Slavin.

Diets higher in fiber lower the risk of heart disease. They also help keep people from gaining too much weight. Yet most American adults only eat about half the fiber they should.

"I want people to eat more fiber," said Slavin. That includes choosing whole fruits over juice.
## Fiber Prevents Overeating

Eating fiber also causes a feeling of fullness. This helps prevent people from overeating. One 2009 study found that people who ate apple slices before lunch felt more full than those who drank apple juice. They then ate 15 percent less during lunch.

But the same study suggests fiber isn't the only thing. A third group in the study ate applesauce, which has about as much fiber as the apple slices. That group ate less at lunch than the juice drinkers. But they still had more to eat than those who ate raw apples before lunch.

Field offered one explanation: Juice, smoothies and applesauce don't require chewing. Research suggests that chewing helps signal the body that it's eaten enough for the moment.

But experts admit it can be hard to eat enough whole fruits and vegetables. Adults are supposed to eat around 2 cups of fruit and 3 cups of vegetables a day.

It may not seem like much fun to eat a whole bowl of vegetables, said Doerfler. This may be one reason juices and smoothies are so popular.
## Still, Better Than Nothing

Everyone agrees Americans do not eat enough fruits and vegetables. Juices aren't the best way to solve that problem. But they are better than nothing, said nutritionist Christina Stark.

Doerfler said smoothies and juice can be an easy way to shift to a more plant-based diet. Vegetable blends are a healthier choice. If you want to make them tastier, add just a small amount of fruit.
