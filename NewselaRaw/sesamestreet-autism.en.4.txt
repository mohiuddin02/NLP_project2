Julia is Sesame Street's newest Muppet. She has bright orange hair and big green eyes. Sometimes, it takes her a long time to answer questions. Julia has autism.

She is also a girl.

That might seem strange. Most children who have autism are boys.

Sherrie Westin works at Sesame. At first, she was not sure if the new muppet should be a girl. Then she thought more about it. It started to make sense to her. Sesame wanted people to understand that girls can have autism, too.

## Sesame Street Launches Special Website

Sesame Street has a new website. It shows Sesame's new plan. It is called "Sesame Street and Autism: See Amazing in All Children." The website introduces Julia and several videos about autism. Julia is not on TV yet.

Children with autism can look and act very differently from one another. Some can talk, while others cannot. Many autistic kids are uncomfortable with noise. Some have trouble looking others in the eye. Many like to touch different things to see how they feel.

Julia can talk. She cannot look people in the eye for very long. She flaps her arms when she gets excited. "We chose things we thought would be most helpful and most typical," Westin said. Julia is also very curious and smart.

## Julia And Elmo

Autism is complicated. The website does not explain everything about it. Instead, it shows how Julia communicates with other muppets.

In one scene, Julia and Elmo are on swings. Elmo wants Julia to meet his friend Abby. Julia does not look up. This causes Abby to say, "Your friend doesn't like me."

Then, Elmo explains what is happening. Julia has autism, he says. "So she does things a little differently. Sometimes Elmo talks to Julia using fewer words and says the same things a few times."

Sesame is watching the new website, it said. The company wants to see if it is easy for kids to use.
