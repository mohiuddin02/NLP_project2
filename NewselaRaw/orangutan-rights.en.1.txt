For the first time anywhere, an ape has received the same basic rights as a human. The orangutan, who lives at the Buenos Aires Zoo, had those rights granted on Dec. 18, 2014, by an Argentine criminal appeals court.

The ruling will change forever the life of the female orangutan named Sandra. It also may ultimately spur the relatively new movement to set free other animals living in captivity in zoos.

In Argentina, at least, Sandra now has the right to life, liberty and freedom from harm. "The ruling was historic because before, a nonhuman primate like Sandra was considered an object and therefore there was no dispute about its captivity," said Andrés Gil Dominguez. He is with the Association of Professional Lawyers for Animal Rights in Argentina, which filed the legal petition for Sandra, asserting that she had been unjustifiably denied her freedom.

## Born In Captivity

The court's decision will lead to a search to find a home for Sandra outside the zoo's cages where she has lived for the last 20 years. She had been born in captivity in Germany in 1986. The Argentine justice system will now assemble a committee of experts to find a sanctuary or another home for Sandra, as long as the aging orangutan is healthy enough to travel elsewhere.

Sandra's case began when a nongovernmental organization filed for her habeas corpus in November. Habeas corpus is a Latin term. It is used in legal cases in which lawyers believe someone has been unfairly imprisoned and asks for the prisoner to be brought to court. The petition was unsuccessful in November, but was later heard by the appeals court.

Interest in seeing the orangutan set free dates back to 2012 when a previous administration at the Buenos Aires Zoo, led by zoologist Claudio Bertonatti, had considered the possibility of sending the ape to a sanctuary. The zoo never took any action, however.

Sandra's case will likely energize other legal efforts for other animals—in particular, 17 chimpanzees in zoos throughout Argentina.  "Considering that they are very close to human primates, it is an absurdity that they are still in captivity in prison," said primatologist Aldo Giúdice of the University of Buenos Aires.

## Seeking Suitable Sanctuary

Before Sandra's case, legal claims were filed for zoo primates in other parts of Argentina. Outside of Argentina, there was a case in 2005 for a chimpanzee named Suiça in the zoo in San Salvador, Brazil. Suiça died before the case could be judged. In 2012, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) tried to use the U.S. Constitution's 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery and forced labor, to gain freedom for orcas in captivity.

In 2013, the Nonhuman Rights Project initiated legal claims on behalf of four chimpanzees in New York state. They were rejected, but the court decisions are being appealed. "With our claims, we are looking for imprisoned nonhuman animals to be returned to their natural environment," said Steven Wise, president of the organization. The group counts renowned British primatologist Jane Goodall as a member. If it's not possible to return them to nature, "we will try to send them to a suitable sanctuary."

The groundswell of support for freeing animals grew out of 40 years of primate research. "Studies such as those by Dian Fossey, Jane Goodall and other scientists helped to position the great apes as people," Giúdice said. "Seeing them in zoos today recalls human exhibits from other regions of the world in the World's Fairs in Paris in the 19th century."

Scientific research, he added, has shown that they are creatures who can feel, suffer and think, and are aware of themselves as individuals. "We cannot be accomplices and let them suffer in prison," he said.
