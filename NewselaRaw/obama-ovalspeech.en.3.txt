WASHINGTON, D.C. — In a rare speech Sunday night, President Barack Obama tried to make Americans feel safer. He promised the United States will win the war against terror.

Obama spoke from his office in the White House. A week ago, a married couple attacked a holiday party in San Bernardino, California. They killed 14 people and wounded 21. Officials say the wife posted on Facebook that she was loyal to the Islamic State group. She is from Pakistan. Her husband was born in America to a Pakistani family.

Islamic State is a violent group. It wants to start a country under its type of Islamic law. Its fighters have taken over parts of Syria and Iraq. The extremist group is also known as ISIS.

## "An Act Of Terrorism"

Obama said there was no reason to think that anyone told the couple to attack the holiday party. Also, there is no evidence that anyone else was involved.

"This was an act of terrorism designed to kill innocent people," Obama said.

Obama spoke during the evening when most people are home from work and school. He did not announce any major new plan for defeating the Islamic State.

Florida Senator Marco Rubio is running for president. Rubio belongs to the Republican Party, which opposes Obama's party, the Democrats. Rubio said that nothing in Obama's speech will make people feel safer.

Obama said he wanted companies and police to cooperate. He said they must make sure anyone wanting to attack the United States does not use technology to hide. Islamic State fighters use cellphone apps to secretly talk. He also urged Congress to approve military strikes against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

Obama asked lawmakers to pass a law to prevent guns from being sold to people on the no-fly list. The people on the list may be dangerous and are not allowed to fly in or out of the United States.

## Treat Muslims Fairly, Obama Says

The president also urged Americans not to turn against Muslims. People should not take out their anger on Muslims. Most Muslims are nothing like ISIS. He also asked Muslims in the United States and around the world to fight extremism.

Obama said that there are some extremists in Muslim communities in the United States. Muslims must face the problem and help stop it, he said.

Obama also repeated his call for more gun control laws. He said that would-be killers must be prevented from getting guns.

"What we can do, and must do, is make it harder for them to kill," he said.

Obama stands little chance of getting Congress to agree to his plan. The majority of Congress are Republicans. On Thursday, the Senate rejected a law that would have stopped suspected extremists from buying guns. Some people said this law would be unfair. The government may suspect them, but they have not been found guilty of a crime.

During the speech, Obama said he is against sending more soldiers to fight Islamic State.

Some people have questioned Obama's plans to fight the Islamic State. Even some members of his own party are wondering about his plan. Hours before he spoke, Hillary Clinton said the United States is "not winning" the fight against Islamic State. Clinton is the leading Democrat trying to run for president in 2016.

## Last Month's Attack In Paris

Obama has insisted that Islamic State is not growing stronger in Iraq and Syria. However, the group has launched attacks elsewhere in the world.

On Nov. 13, Islamic State carried out its worst attack in Europe. Gunmen killed 130 people in Paris, France, and wounded hundreds more.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is investigating last week's attack in California as an act of terror. If proved, it would be the worst attack by Islamic extremists in America since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in New York City.

The woman in the California attack posted on Facebook that she was loyal to Islamic State, said a U.S. official. A Facebook official said her statement was posted about the time she and her husband carried out their attack.
