BEIRUT — In a bar in Beirut, Lebanon, Nasser Shorbaji and Marwan Alameh try not to knock over their microphones. They're laughing during their weekly radio show.

Moments later, they turn more serious as they play Palestinian hip-hop. The discussion turns to the war in the Palestinian territory of Gaza. Palestinians and Israelis have been fighting there. Heads nod in the packed bar to the rhymes of a Palestinian rapper.

Shorbaji and Alameh are among several Lebanese graffiti artists and rappers trying to reach unhappy youth. Lebanon — like much of the Middle East — is in the middle of political chaos and violence. The artists are trying to bring young people into a debate about the troubles.

"People don't want to be preached to. So we're just doing a fun thing in order to put out serious issues," said Alameh, 32.

## Rapping About Society's Conflicts

One example is Shorbaji's latest music video for his song "O.P.P." The song takes its title from the 1991 hit by U.S. hip-hop group Naughty By Nature. The remake by Shorbaji, 29, is about a bomber working as a bank clerk. The clerk is thinking about whether or not to bomb the bank.

Another example is rapper and graffiti artist Omar Kabbani, 31. He runs a rap, graffiti and street clothing group with his brother Mohamed.

"They say I was born with a microphone and my twin brother with a spray can," Kabbani said. "We consider ourselves to be the eight o'clock news when we go out to do graffiti."

Kabbani says he wouldn't call their work political. Yet, their music and street art does not avoid Lebanese society's conflicts. Many of their designs feature "Grendizer," a giant war robot from Japanese cartoons. They use Grendizer to make fun of people who blindly follow Lebanon's religious and political groups — and their private armies.

"Many people that were warlords in Lebanon are now ruling the country," Kabbani says. Lebanon went through a 15-year civil war, which ended in 1990. Leaders of armed groups during the war now run Lebanon's government.

## "Create And Change Visual Scenery"

The Kabbani brothers' latest graffiti mural is about the recent bombings that shook Lebanon. It features the popular 1980s video game character Bomberman. He's shown running with a cartoon-like bomb in his hands, ready to blow up. Bomberman skips past the word "Wanted," written in Arabic. Kabbani says the graffiti is about how Lebanese leaders use the threat of terrorism. He says they frighten people about the threat of terrorism to increase their power.

Jackson Allers is an American journalist in Beirut who writes about Arab hip-hop. Allers believes Lebanese artists are just beginning to discover how much power they have.

"Their influence is increasing," he said.

Ali Rafei, 28, is a graffiti and street artist from Tripoli, Lebanon's second-largest city. Since civil war began in neighboring Syria, fighting has spilled over into Tripoli.

Rafei said decay in his city from the fighting has provided space for his street paintings. They can easily be seen and appreciated.

"The emptiness that's there pushes you to create and change visual scenery," he said. Rafei hopes to change people's views and reduce anger. People "would prefer a drawing with colors and some meaning to them than a gray wall with pictures of politicians that do nothing for them."
