Head injuries can happen in an instant, but their effects last much longer.

A student could hit their head in a car accident or while playing sports. If their brain is hurt, they might have problems in school — even weeks after the accident.

A journal for doctors called Pediatrics just published a new report about students and brain injuries called concussions. Researchers found that almost all teens who experience brain injuries have problems going back to school. They are tired and have headaches that make learning very difficult.

## Students In Toughest Classes Struggle The Most

Students with mild concussions usually recover in one to three weeks. Others take longer to heal. Most students whose brain injuries last longer than four weeks say they have trouble taking notes and doing their homework.

For the Pediatrics report, researchers studied 349 students. All of the students' brains had  been injured within the past four weeks. Almost 70 percent of them still showed signs of brain injury. They had headaches and dizziness and mood swings. They also had trouble concentrating and being around bright lights.

Students taking the most difficult classes — especially math classes — seemed to have the most trouble. Students whose moods changed because of their accidents also had a very hard time.

## Fast Healers Still Have Trouble

Even the students whose brains healed the fastest still had problems in school. About a third of the students who recovered quickly had headaches and concentration problems that hurt their schoolwork.

Researchers say schools need to do more to help students with brain injuries. They say many schools don't realize that students with concussions need some of the same kinds of help they give students with learning disabilities.

The study recommends that doctors write out special plans for students' families to give their schools. Each plan should give the school detailed instructions about how to help the injured student.

## Injured Students Need To Do Less Schoolwork

While they are getting better, the injured student might not spend as much time at school as other students do. They will probably need to take breaks and do less homework. It might be a good idea to reschedule some of their tests.

Noise can also be a problem for students with brain injuries. Teachers might need to let an injured student leave class a few minutes early so they can change classes while the hallways are empty. They might also prefer to eat lunch in a quiet place by themselves.
