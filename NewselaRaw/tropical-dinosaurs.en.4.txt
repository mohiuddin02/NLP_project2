For millions of years, there was one place where Earth's biggest dinosaurs would not go. These dinosaurs are called sauropodomorphs. They stayed out of tropical places.

Tropical areas are located close to the equator. The equator is an imaginary line around the middle of the Earth. It is sort of like a belt around the Earth's waist.

Sauropodomorphs were plant eaters with long necks. This family of dinosaurs includes sauropods like Brontosaurus and Diplodocus.

More than 200 million years ago, they became common in northern and southern parts of the world. Scientists have found their fossils in places like Europe and Argentina. They say sauropodomorphs did not live near the equator until many millions of years later.

Now scientists think they know why.

## Checking Out The Weather Back Then

So what took the sauropodomorphs so long? What was wrong with the middle of the planet? One group of scientists believe these huge dinosaurs stayed away because of the weather problems in that area. They wrote a report about it in a science magazine.

The scientists found that the air the dinosaurs breathed was much different than it is today. It contained lots of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is in the air that comes out of your nose and mouth when you exhale.

All the extra carbon dioxide in the air created weather problems. The weather in the tropical areas was the toughest for the big plant-eating dinosaurs. It changed back and forth very quickly.

"It was not a happy place for them to be hanging out," said Nathan Smith. He is one of the scientists who worked on the new study. Smith is also in charge of dinosaur studies at the Natural History Museum in Los Angeles County, California.

## On The Big Continent Called Pangea

Smith and his team figured out what the world would have been like for the sauropodomorphs. They studied fossils from New Mexico. Millions of years ago, New Mexico was closer to the equator. Back then, there was one big continent called Pangea. Later, Pangea broke up into all the continents humans live on today.

Smith's team studied bones and grains. They wanted to see which plants and animals lived in the tropics at the time of the sauropodomorphs.

Tropical weather was also part of their project. The scientists found that the weather changed often. It switched from very wet to very dry. They also learned that wildfires wiped out many plants. The air had four to six times as much carbon dioxide as it does today.

Life would have been tough in the tropics, but some animals survived the weather. Scientists found proof that small meat-eating dinosaurs lived there. Big reptiles related to modern crocodiles did, too.

## Millions Of Years Later ...

Smith's team decided those reptiles must have been better at dealing with weather changes than the sauropodomorphs were. The scientists said it might be because the reptiles did not need very much food. The reptiles were also a lot smaller than the large dinosaurs. Small, meat-eating dinosaurs also lived in the tropical areas.

The bigger dinosaurs did find a way to live in the tropics millions of years later. Scientists are not sure how it happened. Some think that climate change may have had something to do with it.

"We don't have a great explanation," said Smith. He thinks it was probably a mix of things that made it possible for the sauropodomorphs to live in the tropics.
