### PRO: Ukraine needs U.S. weapons to stop Russia from taking more of its land

WASHINGTON — Congress can push the United States in a better direction to help Ukraine fight against Russia. A proposal in Congress would give Ukraine $350 million for weapons and other military equipment.

Ukraine needs the aid to stop Russia from taking more of its land. U.S. lawmakers should vote yes on the proposal.

Russia took Crimea from Ukraine in March. Many people in Crimea have Russian ancestry and speak Russian. Some wanted to separate from Ukraine and fought Ukraine's government. Russia supported these separatists as they began their attacks. Then Russian troops invaded Ukraine and took over Crimea.

Russian President Vladimir Putin dreams of bringing back the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union was a huge country in which Russia ruled over Ukraine and many Eastern European countries.

## Weak Actions Won't Stop Russia

Putin won't be stopped by the weak actions of the U.S. and Western Europe. So far, they've only put in place weak trade blocks to prevent countries and businesses from buying and selling with Russia. Threatening slightly tougher trade blocks won't do anything.

It's important to take action because Putin is not just after Ukraine. Now he's threatening Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. Those Baltic countries are our allies. All are members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military alliance. The group is led by the U.S. and Western Europe. NATO members swear to protect one another.

What Putin is doing threatens global peace.

Only U.S. military aid to Ukraine could possibly stop Putin. So far we've given just non-military aid. It won't do much. As Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said recently, "Blankets and night-vision goggles are important. But one cannot win a war with blankets."

The U.S. and other allies have made weak efforts to stop Putin. They haven't succeeded. Far from it. In fact, Putin has just pushed ahead.

## Are The Baltic Countries Next?

After Russia took Crimea, in an unfair election Crimeans voted 95.5 percent to join Russia. U.S. and European leaders called the election illegal. Then they blocked some trade out of Russia and started doing military drills in the area. None of those actions stopped Putin.

Then, Russia gave help to separatists in Ukraine who want to join Russia. Russia sent troops and arms across the border into Ukraine. It cut off natural gas supplies to Ukraine, which it needs for heating homes and buildings. Russia then forced Ukraine to let the separatists rule over the area of Ukraine they had taken. Russia made that part of the cease-fire to stop the fighting. Already, the Russian separatists have broken it.

A top Russian official recently complained of discrimination against ethnic Russians and the Russian language in the Baltics. We should be concerned. What happened in Ukraine could also happen there.

In addition, Russia arrested an Estonian official along their shared border. They claim he was spying. Obama visited Estonia to show U.S. support for the Baltic countries. Putin didn't care.

Russia also captured a Lithuanian fishing ship. Russia claimed that it had sailed into Russian waters. Even more troubling, Russia asked Lithuania to send 1,500 people who used to be Soviet citizens to Russia. Supposedly, they hadn't joined the military when they were young men in the Soviet Union.

## Approve Aid To Ukraine

It gets worse. In mid-September, Russian nuclear bombers flew within 63 miles of Alaska and 46 miles of Canada. The action forced U.S. and Canadian jets to fly out in response.

Russia is also upgrading its nuclear weapons with new missiles, submarines and a new bomber.

Congress should vote to approve the $350 million for weapons to give to Ukraine. Then President Obama should sign it.

Otherwise, we'll surely see more Russian attacks in Ukraine and beyond.

### CON: Ukraine needs to work out a peace with the eastern separatists

COLUMBUS, Ohio — Ukraine's government is fighting people in the country who want to break away and join Russia. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko wants weapons to fight these pro-Russia separatists and is asking the U.S. for help.

President Barack Obama will give military aid to Ukraine. But it won't include weapons. Obama is right to not give weapons to Ukraine's government.

There is a deal to stop fighting between Ukraine's government and the separatists. For now the sides aren't fighting much.

The separatists control some of Ukraine's largest eastern cities. Warfare there has wrecked parts of eastern Ukraine. If the cease-fire stops the fighting, the war will not continue. Giving Ukraine weapons would risk making the situation there worse. It would come at a time when matters seem to be getting fixed.

## It's Not About U.S. And Russia

Poroshenko has just made an important deal. He passed a law to let the separatists have more control over the areas they have taken. That law, along with the cease-fire, could end the fighting.

Obama's decision does not satisfy everyone in Congress. A Senate committee has called for weapons to give to Ukraine's government. But what the U.S. should now do is to keep up the cease-fire. It also should make sure the new law is put in place.

That law is a good first step. It gives the population in eastern Ukraine more freedom to run their areas. It would let the people there keep the close ties that they've always had with Russia.

Some people think the law is a win for Russia and a loss for the U.S. The situation shouldn't be about the U.S. and Russia. The goal should be to do what is best for Ukraine.

## Ending The Bloodshed In Ukraine

It will not be easy. The new law doesn't say exactly which parts of eastern Ukraine are involved. It also doesn't say how much freedom the people will have to run the area.

Knowing what the people in eastern Ukraine want is also unclear. One group of the easterners want nothing to do with Ukraine's government. This is the opinion of the separatists. But a second group in eastern Ukraine is comfortable with being ruled by Ukraine's government. And perhaps a third group just wants peace.

One important part of the new law is that it allows the Russian language to be used publicly in eastern Ukraine. Russian could be spoken there in schools, courts and government. That is a good step.

It is not clear what kind of relationship eastern Ukraine will have with Russia. Russia took over Crimea earlier in the year. The same thing probably won't happen to eastern Ukraine. The Ukrainian government and the separatists have to work out a plan to please everyone.

The United States should help make that happen. There is every reason to believe that a plan can be reached to end the bloodshed in Ukraine.
