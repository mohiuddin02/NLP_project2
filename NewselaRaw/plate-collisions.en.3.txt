LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. — Being a catcher in Major League Baseball may get safer. The league plans to make a new rule against runners crashing into catchers as soon as next season but no later than 2015.

New York Mets general manager Sandy Alderson made the announcement Wednesday. Alderson is in charge of the league's rules committee. The major reasons behind the decision were player safety and concern over injuries to the brain called concussions. Doctors have learned that concussions can do more damage to the brain than people had thought before.

Alderson explained that the league wants people to stop accepting that such crashes are just part of the game. The risk to players' health is too great to just keep doing something because it's a tradition, he added.

Baseball is built upon its traditions. A ban will be a major step.

## "What's The Game Coming To?"

Not everybody agrees with the change.

"You're not allowed to pitch inside. The hitters wear more armor than the Humvees in Afghanistan," Pete Rose said in a telephone interview. "Now you're not allowed to be safe at home plate? What's the game coming to?"

It seems "the guys making all these rules never played the game of baseball," added Rose, who was banned from baseball for life following a gambling investigation.

Rose famously knocked over catcher Ray Fosse in the 1970 All-Star game. Rose insists Fosse was blocking the plate without the ball, which is against the rules.

Alderson said team owners will get the chance to approve the rules next month.

## Collision Ended Catcher's Season

The players' union will also need to approve the rule before it can go into effect. The union is the group that represents the players. If the union agrees, the rule would go into effect in 2014. If the union doesn't, the rule would become effective in 2015.

The union did not want to comment while the rule is being reviewed.

Talk about banning home plate crashes has gotten more serious lately. In May 2011, San Francisco Giant Buster Posey was injured by Florida Marlin Scott Cousins. Posey broke a bone in his lower left leg and tore three ligaments in his ankle. The injury ended his season.

"This is, I think, in response to a few issues that have arisen," Alderson said. "One is just the general occurrence of injuries from these incidents at home plate that affect players, both runners and catchers." Alderson added that there are worries about concussions – and not just in baseball. "It's an emerging issue, and one that we in baseball have to address, as well as other sports."

The National Football League agreed to pay $765 million to former players last summer. The players took the league to court. They claimed the concussions they got while playing caused them serious, long-lasting health problems. Last month, a group of hockey players sued the NHL.

## Fines And Suspensions Possible

Former catchers Joe Girardi, Bruce Bochy and Mike Matheny attended Wednesday's meeting. All three of them now manage major league teams.

"I lost time as a catcher being run over a couple different times, but I thought it was part of my job and I enjoyed the contact," said Girardi, the New York Yankees manager. "Now I'm not so sure that everyone enjoys contact. But I love football, so I liked it."

MLB plans to have different levels of punishment for breaking the rule.

"I think there will be two levels of enforcement," Alderson said. "One will be with respect to whether the runner is declared safe or out based on conduct. So, for example, intentionally running over the catcher might result in an out call." But punishment may also carry over off the field, he explained. Some players could get fines and suspensions.

But writing out the rules will likely be complicated.

"Does it include at every base or just home plate?" Baltimore Orioles manager Buck Showalter asked. "What's considered blocking the plate, and how do you define all of it?"
