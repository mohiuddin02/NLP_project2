CHICAGO â€” Freshly made juices are supposed to be good for you. The people who sell them say they give you energy fast. They have lots of vitamins and minerals. They even make you thinner, they say. And juices are tasty and easy to drink.

Lots of people want to eat healthy foods. Many of them buy gallons of juice. Others make their own juices at home.

But juice is not the healthiest way to get fruit in your diet. Food experts such as dietitians and nutritionists say so. Barry Popkin even calls juice dangerous. He teaches nutrition.

## Too Much Sugar

Juice has a lot of calories and sugar. Calories give us energy, but they also add weight.

Popkin said drinking lots of juice can make you fat. Too much sugar in a diet can even lead to diseases.

Some experts say juices are healthy. They are better than sodas, says Elizabeth Ward. She is a dietitian. She works with Jamba Juice.

But many experts say juice has too much sugar. It's like eating candy, said Lara Field. She's a dietitian too.

## Eat The Fruit Instead

Another problem is that making the juice takes out the fiber. You don't get one of the best parts of the fruit.

Not eating enough fiber is bad for you, said Joanne Slavin. She teaches food science.

Fiber fills you up, so you eat less. It helps people stay thin and healthy. And chewing tells your body you had enough to eat.

Smoothies do have fiber, because they have fruit skins in them. But they still have a lot of calories.

It is hard to eat enough fruits and vegetables. That is why juices and smoothies are so popular.

Grownups need around 2 cups of fruit a day. And 3 cups of vegetables.

Juices aren't the best way to fix that problem, said Christina Stark. She is a nutritionist. But she said juices are better than nothing.

If you're going to drink juice, try vegetable blends, Bethany Doerfler said. She's a dietician. Her advice: add just a little fruit to make them tastier.
