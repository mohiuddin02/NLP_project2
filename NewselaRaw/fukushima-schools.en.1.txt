MATSUMOTO, Japan — The 12-year-old girl didn't want to leave her younger brother, and her grandparents didn't want her to go away. But the family lives near the "no-go zone" surrounding Japan's destroyed Fukushima nuclear plant and has other things to consider. Her safety, they decided, must come first.

Yukie Hashimoto and her husband sent their daughter 200 miles away, to the picturesque ski town of Matsumoto. The mayor there had offered to take in and educate young people living in the shadow of the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant.

Research has not shown the children to be in clear danger from exposure to low-dose radiation. Still, many people near Fukushima do not trust the government to tell the truth about how severe the radiation levels really are. The Hashimoto family, and the parents of seven other children, decided to accept the mayor's offer.

"I didn't really believe things are as safe as the government is telling us," said Hashimoto, who lives in Koriyama, about 20 miles west of the 12-mile no-go zone. "We made our decision with her future, 10 years and 20 years later, in mind."

## Eight From Fukushima

The eight students — seven in junior high school and one in elementary school — began their new lives this month, with the beginning of Japan's school year. They live in a rented house with bunk beds and live-in caretakers.

The project is the brainchild of Matsumoto's mayor, Akira Sugenoya. A medical doctor, Sugenoya performed more than 100 thyroid-cancer operations in neighboring Belarus after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear plant disaster in Ukraine.

For those outside the largely off-limits 12-mile zone, taking such an extreme step is relatively rare. The Hashimoto family took some time to make their decision.

A wide range of views on the risks of radiation has divided both their family and entire communities. Hashimoto was nervous about speaking to a reporter, because raising questions can get one branded as a troublemaker. She requested that her daughter not be named for fear of a backlash.

Like many near the Fukushima plant, Hashimoto routinely measured the radioactivity in her neighborhood. Some spots were a bit high, registering in a gray area where scientists are divided about the long-term effects. Still, children, she knew, are far more likely to be harmed by radiation than adults.

The girl's grandparents and her college-age brother find the fretting about radiation ridiculous. But for the 12-year-old herself, the sticking point was her 5-year-old younger brother, who cannot be part of the program, which starts at third grade.

The girl said she was worried she wouldn't be there to watch over the boy — she had been making sure he wore masks and didn't eat local food.

## "No One Knows For Sure"

Then the girl started getting nosebleeds and growing pale, and seemed to have no energy. That may have had nothing to do with radiation, but it made Hashimoto decide to get her out, and her husband relented.

"The low-dose radiation is continuing," Hashimoto said. "There is no precedent" — meaning, nothing like this has ever happened before. "We don't know what effect that will have on our children."

So far, 33 children have been diagnosed with thyroid cancer in Fukushima in the last three years, among 270,000 checked. Thyroid cancer among children is very rare: Out of a million children, no more than a handful of cases would normally be expected.

Still, some experts say the higher cases are merely a result of more thorough checking. Also, they point out, the surge in thyroid cancer cases in Belarus and Ukraine did not surface until four or five years after the Chernobyl disaster.

The U.N. Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation has concluded that cancer rates won't increase in a recognizable way. It estimated that "fewer than 1,000 children" are at risk of developing thyroid cancer.

"The bottom line is: No one knows for sure. What we do know is that the cases of cancer are up, and so naturally we are worried," said Hiroshi Ueki, a former Fukushima resident who moved with his wife and two children and now oversees the Matsumoto project. The project relies heavily on donations and parents pay 30,000 yen ($300) a month to cover basic living expenses.

## Fukushima Friends Stick Together

A recent government study found that one in four children from the area struck by the 2011 tsunami disaster, including Fukushima, suffered emotional problems.

Kokoro Kamiyama, 13, the first child to sign on to the Matsumoto project, often skipped school when she was in Fukushima. Her mother believes that behavior resulted from her daughter's worries about radiation.

Living through the 2011 disaster made her decide to be a doctor when she grows up, she says in a soft voice. She is happy she can run around outdoors in Matsumoto without wearing a mask.

"The air feels so clean here," Kamiyama said. "I love playing badminton. And tag."

Last Friday, she looked very much at home as she sat in the gymnasium decorated with flowers at Aida Junior High School for a school opening ceremony.

So did Hashimoto's daughter, though she had a rough start in Matsumoto. She was in constant tears for the first few days, but by Friday she said she had made lots of great friends.

Those friends are mostly other students from Fukushima. They're sticking together.
