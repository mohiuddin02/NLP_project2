WASHINGTON â€” Where some candidates live could make a difference in the next election.

Some people running for the Senate have put down Washington, D.C., as their hometown, not the states where they are running. Others moved into their states just before the election. Critics say they are just using the states as a way to get into the Senate. Maybe they think it will be easier to win an election in their new state.

Election rules say that Senate candidates have to live in the states they want to represent. The rules can be fuzzy.

The issue is heating up in several states with important Senate races. These include Alaska, Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana and New Hampshire. What happens in these races could decide which political party controls the Senate.

There are two main political parties in the United States. They are called the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. Members of each party have more or less the same ideas about running the government. They also have similar goals, and usually vote the same way.

## Out Of Touch With Voters?

The hometown question comes at a time when people really don't like politicians, which is another word for elected officials. Many people think politicians will do anything to get into power. People also think politicians will say whatever they think people want to hear. Not many voters approve how Congress is doing. Most voters think the country is going in the wrong direction.

Sarah Binder is an expert on Congress. Binder said that many people worry that lawmakers are out of touch with the people in their home states.

"Voters don't like to be forgotten," she said.

Already this year, the out-of-touch charge helped defeat Representative Eric Cantor, a Republican from Virginia. To many, he seemed more interested in Washington than in Virginia. He lost the election this year.

Senator Pat Roberts is a Republican from Kansas. He has struggled to answer questions about where he lives. He once said he returns to Kansas whenever someone runs against him.

Roberts does not own a home in Kansas. He was registered to vote at the home of another person in Kansas. Roberts said he paid rent to the owner of the home.

## Alaska

Dan Sullivan is a Republican. He went to Washington in 2002 to work for the government. He kept his home in Alaska and returned there in 2009. Now the Democrat running against him is attacking him for spending so much time out of Alaska.

## Arkansas

Tom Cotton, a Republican, is running against Senator Mark Pryor, a Democrat. Cotton does not own property in the state. He points out that his family has been living in Arkansas for six generations. He lives in a home his father owns. Cotton filmed a television ad in front of that house. He promises, "I'll stay connected to my roots."

Pryor also put his father in an ad. His father is David Pryor, who used to be an Arkansas governor and senator.

## Louisiana

Senator Mary Landrieu is a Democrat. She listed her Washington home as her home address.

Republicans claimed she lived in Washington, not Louisiana. Landrieu said she still lived in Louisiana. She and her family own the home in New Orleans where she grew up, she said.

## Mississippi

Senator Thad Cochran first said he lived in Washington. In February, he changed that to Oxford, Mississippi.

His opponent is Chris McDaniel. McDaniel says Cochran spends too much time in Washington.

## New Hampshire

Scott Brown used to represent Massachusetts in the Senate. Now he's running for the Senate in New Hampshire. He is a Republican.

Jeanne Shaheen is the current senator. She is a Democrat. She reminded voters of his recent switch. She said, "My goal has been to serve the people of New Hampshire, not to serve myself."

## Kansas

In 25 months, Roberts spent just 97 days in Kansas.

Clay Barker is the head of the Kansas Republican Party. He said this should not be a problem for voters. "If you send a guy to Washington, D.C., to work for you there, do you want him always back in Kansas watching TV?" Barker said. "His workplace is D.C."
