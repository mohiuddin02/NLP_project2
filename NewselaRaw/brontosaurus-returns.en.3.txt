The Brontosaurus got its name back.

For more than a century, scientists thought the gigantic dinosaur might not have existed. They thought it was the same dinosaur as the Apatosaurus. But a new study has found that the Brontosaurus is really a Brontosaurus after all.

The long-necked, long-tailed sauropods were the largest animals to ever walk the Earth. The most famous of these giants is probably the Brontosaurus, the "thunder lizard." The plant-eating dinosaurs lived about 154 to 150 million years ago during the Late Jurassic Period.

## Game Of Bones

The first Brontosaurus was named in 1879 by Othniel Charles Marsh, a paleontologist, or scientist who studies fossils. In 1903, another paleontologist, Elmer Riggs, decided that Brontosaurus was the same dinosaur as the Apatosaurus. According to the rules of scientific naming, the oldest name wins.

Now a new study says that Brontosaurus was the right name all along. Scientists found that the Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus fossils look different enough to belong to separate groups after all.

For instance, the neck of the Brontosaurus is higher and narrower than the neck of the Apatosaurus, says study author Emanuel Tschopp. He is a paleontologist at the New University of Lisbon in Portugal.

Although both are very massive animals, "Apatosaurus is even more extreme than Brontosaurus," he said.

The researchers analyzed 477 different parts of 81 sauropod fossils. It took them five years and many visits to museums in Europe and the United States to look at the dinosaur bones.

## Taking Another Look

At first, the scientists just wanted to understand the family tree of the diplodocids species, which is part of the sauropod family. The diplodocid dinosaurs include Diplodocus, Apatosaurus and now Brontosaurus.

In a nearly 300-page report, the scientists concluded that three known species of Brontosaurus exist. Brontosaurus excelsus was the first discovered, and the other two are Brontosaurus parvus and Brontosaurus yahnahpin. They published their findings online April 7 in the journal PeerJ, a magazine for scientists.

Mike Taylor teaches paleontology at the University of Bristol in England. He said the research is complete and comprehensive. He also said that the researchers were careful to make sure that other scientists could check that their results were correct.

The study "really sets a new standard," Taylor said. "I am in awe of the authors."

Tschopp said they wouldn't have been able to do the study 15 years ago. Many dinosaurs similar to Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus have been found recently. These discoveries made it possible to take another look at how different the two dinosaurs actually were, he says.

## "Much More Diverse"

Kenneth Carpenter is the director of paleontology at Utah State University Eastern's Prehistoric Museum. He was also impressed by the study, but said the fossil on which Apatosaurus is based has never been described in detail. He said the researchers should have described the Apatosaurus dinosaur in detail first. "So is Brontosaurus valid after all?" he asked. "Maybe. But I think the verdict is still out."

All in all, these findings emphasize "that sauropods were much more diverse and fascinating than we've realized," Taylor said. The discovery that the Brontosaurus and the Apatosaurus were two different dinosaurs is "only the tip of the iceberg," he added.

He expected that many other sauropods will need to be renamed as researchers take a closer look at them.

"The Late Jurassic of North America in which they lived may have been a weird time," said Mathew Wedel, a paleontologist at Western University of Health Sciences in California. Many new species developed then in a harsh environment. This "raises the question of how they could have found enough food to have supported them all."

Now, scientists have new mysteries to solve.
