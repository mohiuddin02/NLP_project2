PHILADELPHIA — Archaeologists from the University of Pennsylvania say they have found the tomb of a previously unknown Egyptian pharaoh who ruled more than 3,600 years ago. The tomb, they say, is only the first discovered out of what could be more than a dozen. All, they believe, are the final resting places of members of a forgotten dynasty.

The tomb, found last week, was heavily looted, but hieroglyphs on the chamber walls clearly identified it as belonging to a ruler named Woseribre Senebkay, the Penn team announced Wednesday.

The researchers already have begun excavating several nearby sites that appear to be from the same dynasty. These are located at the site of the ancient city of Abydos, more than 300 miles south of Cairo, said Josef Wegner, a Penn associate professor of Egyptology.

"It looks like there's a whole royal necropolis of this lost dynasty," said Wegner. Necropolis — literally, "city of the dead" — is the term for an ancient cemetery or large complex of tombs.

Archaeologists had suspected the existence of the unknown pharaohs because of an ancient list of rulers called the Turin King List, parts of which are damaged or missing. After analyzing fragmented parts of the list, a Danish researcher named Kim Ryholt proposed years ago that 16 of the unknown kings belonged to the Abydos dynasty.

## "Forgotten To History"

The name Senebkay matches one of the partial names on the list, said Wegner.

"They basically were forgotten to history," Wegner said. "In the later king lists, they don't appear. They just kind of vanish."

The tomb, dated to 1650 B.C., appears to have been raided by tomb robbers in ancient times, Wegner said. Even the king's bodily remains were ripped apart.

Work conducted on the skeleton suggests that Senebkay stood about 5 feet 10 inches tall and died in his mid- to late 40s.

## Reused Organ Chest

The tomb contained remains of a funerary mask, a coffin and a cedar chest. The chest would have been used to house the king's internal organs, customarily removed before burial.

The chest apparently had been reused and seems to have been taken from the nearby tomb of an earlier king already known to history. The discovery of that tomb, belonging to a king named Sobekhotep, was announced by the Penn-Egypt team this week.

The string of discoveries began last year, when Wegner and his associates found a 60-ton stone sarcophagus chamber that appeared to have been moved from its original site. They identified its original owner as Sobekhotep, but are still identifying the king for whom it was reused.

The new discovery of the tomb of Woseribre Senebkay occurred in the process of excavating ruins near the 60-ton chamber. The tombs of other apparent members of the dynasty are thought to lie nearby.

Senebkay's tomb is painted with images of the goddesses Nut, Nephthys, Selket and Isis. His reign occurred during what is known as the Second Intermediate Period, a time when multiple dynasties were competing for supremacy, Wegner said.
