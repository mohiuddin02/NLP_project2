KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia â€” A plane headed from Malaysia to China has been missing for more than a week. Now, Malaysian officials are saying that they believe the plane's disappearance was no accident. It has become one of the most puzzling mysteries in the history of flying.

A Malaysian official said on Saturday that the plane changed its course on purpose. In other words, it's believed that the plane was hijacked.

The plane left for an overnight flight from Malaysia to China at 12:40 a.m. on March 8. At about 1:20 a.m., air traffic controllers lost contact with the plane and it disappeared.

Now, it seems that the plane could still be traced using satellites.

The prime minister said the last confirmed signal between the plane and a satellite came at 8:11 a.m. It was 7 hours and 31 minutes after takeoff.

## Far From Flight Path

The prime minister of Malaysia, Najib Razak, said the satellites proved that the plane continued flying for more than six hours after losing contact with people on the ground. Now, investigators believe that the plane could have gone as far northwest as Kazakhstan in Central Asia. It could have also gone into the southern end of the Indian Ocean.

Many people already believed the plane's disappearance was not an accident. The prime minister's statement helped refocus the investigation.

Najib stressed that investigators were looking into all the possible reasons as to why the plane ended up so far away from its original flight path.

Experts have said that whoever took down the plane's radios and then flew the jet must have known a lot about planes. He or she also had flying experience. The investigators are looking at the pilots, flight crew and the 227 passengers.

Investigators are now fairly sure that one of the plane's radios was turned off before the aircraft reached the east coast of Malaysia, Najib said. Shortly afterward, someone on board switched off the plane's transponder. The transponder allows pilots to talk to air traffic controllers.

## Turned Back To The West

Najib confirmed that radar from the Malaysian military could tell that the plane turned back to the west. Officials had said before that they could not tell for sure where the plane went.

Investigators are looking into how far the plane may have flown after this last point of contact, Najib said. Airline officials said the plane had enough fuel to fly for up to about eight hours.

Satellites show that the plane was in one of two possible areas. It could have been near northern Thailand through to the border of the Central Asian countries of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. It could have also been near Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean. In other words, it could have flown northwest or south.

If the plane took the northern route, it could have taken the plane through China, India, Pakistan and Afghanistan. The plane could have also could have gone through Central Asia. If it did either, it is unclear how the plane wasn't noticed. Military planes from those countries, and U.S. military bases there, would likely have spotted it.

Flying south would have put the plane over the Indian Ocean. The ocean is 12,762 feet deep on average and thousands of miles from land.

## "Painfully" Slow Information

Two-thirds of the plane's passengers were Chinese, so China's government has been asking Malaysia's government for answers. The relatives of passengers want to know what happened.

The Chinese government's Xinhua News Agency said the Malaysian information was "painfully" slow. The agency said it was wasting time and effort. It was also stressful to relatives.

Najib said he understood the need for families to receive information. But he said his government wanted to double-check reports before releasing them.

In the Chinese capital, relatives of passengers have anxiously awaited news at a hotel near Beijing's airport. The relatives say they felt deceived. They thought they should have been told about the plane's last signal earlier.

Malaysian police have already said they are looking into the lives and pasts of the pilot and co-pilot. Both have been called trustworthy, community-minded men.

Fourteen countries are helping to search for the plane, using 43 ships and 58 planes.
