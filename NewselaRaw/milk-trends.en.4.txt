There's soy milk and coconut milk. There's even rice milk. But good old milk â€” the moo cow kind?

It's losing its place at the kitchen table.

Fewer and fewer people are drinking milk. Interest in milk has been falling for years. The last several years saw a huge drop in milk drinking.

"I was a milk lover. And I grew up drinking it. You just kind of had milk with your dinner," said Amy Bryant. She lives in Minnesota. She has two daughters. They are 8 and 5.

Adults drinking milk at dinner now seems old fashioned, she said.

## Drinking Less Milk

Kids used to be the biggest milk drinkers. But even they aren't drinking as much milk as they did.

One out of four preteens don't drink milk every day. This is from a government report. Preteens used to drink a lot more milk.

Mary Hanson-Busch lives in Minnesota. She used to have milk at breakfast. She drank it with cereal, a muffin or toast. But last fall, Hanson-Busch decided she didn't need as much milk. She thought milk was too fattening.

One of her daughters stopped drinking cow's milk. The daughter switched to coconut milk. The family used to drink two gallons a week. Now, they drink just one gallon.

Enter the "plant" milks. These come from almonds, soy and rice. They don't come from cows. So, they're not really milk. They're just called milk. That makes them sound healthier. "Plant" milks have just as much calcium and vitamin D as milk does.

## New Ads For Milk

Calcium and vitamin D are important for building healthy bones. They are added to "plant" milks in the factory. Cow's milk has them naturally. "Plant" milks also cost more money.

Dairy farmers are fighting back. They put out new ads for television and magazines. The ads say milk is healthy and gives people energy to get through their day.

But making milk popular won't be easy. Take Stacey Sundquist. She lives in Minnesota. She and her husband have three kids under age 10. The kids drink milk at meals.

Sundquist used to drink milk three times a day. Now, she drinks more water. She also has developed a taste for almond milk. She even likes it in her morning oatmeal.

"I started questioning whether I needed cow's milk," she said. "I decided I really didn't."
