NEW YORK â€” Bears have been in the news this year. But nowhere more than in Maine. Voters there face a question on Nov. 4. They have a bear problem to solve.

Like other states, they want to keep their bear population low. Hunting is one way of doing that. At the same time, animal rights groups are trying to stop certain ways of hunting. Maine is the only state other than Alaska where hunters can kill bears with bait, traps and dogs.

Voters are being asked if these ways of hunting should be banned. A ban would stop them in almost every case. They would only be allowed to protect property, people's safety, or to study bears.

"The fact is, you don't need to use these methods to hunt the animals," said Wayne Pacelle of the Humane Society. His group wants to change the hunting rules. "Hunting is supposed to give the animals a chance."

Pacelle is working with a group called Mainers for Fair Bear Hunting. They are leading the fight to change the hunting rules.

## Bears Could Lose Their Snacks

On the other side is a group called Save Maine's Bear Hunt. It is fighting to keep the old ways of hunting. The group has a lot of supporters. Maine's wildlife department even supports it. It says that Maine has more than 30,000 black bears.

"We have one of the largest bear populations in the country, certainly on the East Coast," said James Cody. He helps run Save Maine's Bear Hunt. Cody said nearly all of the kills in last year's bear hunt would become illegal. They all used ways of hunting that would be banned.

State wildlife officials said that bait was used most often. It was used in nearly three out of four kills. The bait is usually buckets filled with junk food and sweets.

Getting rid of these ways of hunting would increase the number of bears. It would also hurt businesses that make money from hunting.

## Bears Make The News

Also fighting against changes to the hunting rules are the National Rifle Association and Governor Paul LePage.

Groups that want hunting rules kept could have the news on their side. There have been recent bear attacks in states with large numbers of bears. The most well-known of these happened last month in New Jersey. A 22-year-old hiker there was attacked and killed by a black bear.

Officials killed the bear. A police report described it as a large male weighing 250-300 pounds.

Also last month, a Santa Barbara County, California, woman fought off a black bear. It attacked her while she was out walking her dogs.

## It's A Big Problem

The problem in Maine is a national problem. The number of black bears has increased in many states. The increases are due to efforts to protect the bears. At the same time, more bears and humans are living near each other in some areas.

In Ridgewood, New Jersey, police last month captured a black bear. It was wandering near a school. Wildlife officials there say bear sightings have gone up by almost one-quarter from last year. The bear captured in Ridgewood was let go back into the wild. It had climbed a tree and was shot with a tranquilizer gun.

Surveys show more people in Maine plan to vote "no" in November. They do not want the hunting rules changed. But the "yes" side is still hopeful.
