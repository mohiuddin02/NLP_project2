CHICAGO â€” Sarah Dupuis is a violin teacher. She teaches violin to kids. Some kids have parents who can pay for the lessons. But some of the kids she teaches live in one of Chicago's poorest areas. Their families cannot afford lessons or a violin.

"These kids are so brave, so strong," Sarah said. "They work so hard."

Learning the violin can cost a lot of money. Lessons are expensive. Buying a violin is expensive too.

## Starting With Boxes

Sarah began a free violin program. The program is called MUSIC Inc. It stands for "Music in Urban Schools Inspiring Change."

The program is at KIPP Ascend Primary School. Sarah wants to raise more money. She wants to bring the program to other schools.

At first, MUSIC did not have real violins. The kids learned with fake violins. They were made with empty boxes and strings. A local violin-maker gave the program 25 violins. After that, other people gave even more violins.

## Parents Go To Lessons Too

There are more than 70 KIPP students in the program. They are 7 to 10 years old. They must behave well. They must also finish their homework.

The children get a violin and a song book. Parents are an important part of the program. They attend all the lessons. They become "home teachers." MUSIC holds family classes. The classes teach parents to help their children at home.

## Learning More Than Music

Ashley Wiggins has a fourth-grade daughter. Her daughter is named Madison. Madison is learning the violin. She is learning even more than that.

Madison used to be shy, her mom said. Not long ago, Madison played her violin at their church. "She's much more confident," Ashley said.
