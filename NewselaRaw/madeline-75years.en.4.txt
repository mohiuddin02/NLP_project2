_In an old house in Paris that was covered with vines_

So begins "Madeline" by Ludwig Bemelmans. The well-loved children's book follows the adventures of 12 little girls. Madeline is the title character. She is the smallest and bravest.

"Madeline" was written 75 years ago. This fall, the Chicago Public Library is celebrating. It will throw "Madeline" birthday parties at six libraries. A "Madeline" character will be at the Bookamania children's book fair.

Some of us have been celebrating "Madeline" all along. We have passed our love of this special book to our own children.

## Reading To Our Children

Books like "Madeline" pack serious power. You don't just read them. You reread them, again and again. The words drum into your memory. After 50 years, they are still there.

Children's books feel utterly real. They feel real even if they have talking animals. I loved "Wait Till the Moon Is Full." I used to think I actually watched the raccoon child play ball with his friends.

I wanted my daughters to see this too. When they were young, I started reading my favorite books to them.

It turned out that I still loved them. Other parents love them, too. A friend's husband read "Little House on the Prairie" to their 7-year-old son. The boy was asleep, but the father kept reading.

Your children don't always love your favorite books. Mothers of sons may have a problem. Their boys may not like books about, say, horses or princesses.

## We Love The Same Book!

My children happily listened to all my favorites. We read "Madeline" and "Wait Till the Moon is Full." They snuggled up to me like I snuggled to my own mother.

We also read some of my favorite chapter books. One of them is "The Phantom Tollbooth."

Night after night my husband or I read it to the girls. We took them on travels with Milo. Milo is the main character. He is bored. Then Milo receives a mysterious gift. It leads him into adventures.

People write new and wonderful children's book all the time. Kids don't have to read their parents' old books.

But when they do, magic happens.

You and your children love the same book.
