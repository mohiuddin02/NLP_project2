HACKENSACK, N.J. â€” When he was 3, Mohammad Abdelhamid wanted to be a basketball player.

His mother listened. She took his dream seriously. She raised him to play sports. Mohammad is now in high school. He plays on his school's soccer, basketball and baseball teams.

On a Sunday afternoon, his mother watched Mohammad play against another team. Her name is Azza Abdelziz. She cheered for her son.

Abdelziz also deserves cheers.

## Parents Full Of Pride

She has given up a lot for her son. Other parents have too. They spend time and money so their children can play sports. Abdelziz has changed her life for her son. She no longer has much time to spend with family. She works as a school bus driver because the hours are good. They let her take Mohammad to practices and games before and after school.

Jocelyn Picache is the mother of another player on Mohammad's team. Picache's daughter was in gymnastics. When her daughter was younger, she spent more than $100,000 taking her around the country to tournaments. The girl might have made the U.S. Olympic team. Then, she hurt her back and had to give up gymnastics.

Picache was not angry about spending so much money on her daughter. She was full of pride.

## Dreaming Of College Sports

Howard Breindel is the father of another teen basketball player. He said parents want to help their kids.

"You have kids so you can support them through these years," he said.

He said sports teaches self-control, teamwork and respect. That point was made over and over by parents. Sports help their kids do well in school and in life.

Kevin Goodson's son also plays basketball in high school. Everyone on his son's team dreams of playing basketball in college.

Their chances are not great. About 3 out of every 100 high school basketball players will play on a college team. Just 3 out of 10,000 high school players will play professional basketball.

That is fine with Breindel. There is so much else to do in life, he said. His son will not play basketball in college. Instead, he will study how to make movies.
