OROSI, Calif. —  Emilio Isazaga is only 17 years old. Yet he has already had a hard life. His mother had to leave the United States.  She was in the U.S. without permission. It was against the law. The U.S. government made her go back to Mexico.

Emilio and his sister live with his grandmother. Emilio got in trouble with the police. He hopes going to school will help him.  Emilio hopes his education will give him a good life.

After school, Emilio goes to a program called Tech Connect. The program wants to help students like Emilio. All of its students get extra help. The students all go on to college.

## Helping Poor Kids

Miguel Castañeda started Tech Connect. Miguel wants to help poor kids. He wants them to have the same chances as rich kids. 

It is hard to live in Emilio's town. Orisi is in the state of California. There are many farm workers. They make little money. Orisi is also quite dangerous. There are some bad groups of people.

Students go to Tech Connect Class for one year. There are only 30 spaces. More than 100 students sign up. Miguel does not just take kids with straight A's. He takes students who love to learn.

Emilio is one of those kids.  Emilio loves Tech Connect. Miquel is like a father to him. "He's a role model," Emilio said about Miguel. Emilio makes better choices now. 

## He Doesn't Give Up On People

At Tech Connect, students learn how to fix computers. Miguel knows a lot about computers. He also takes students to visit colleges. He helps them find jobs, too.

Sara is another student in the program. Miguel "doesn't give up on people," she said.

Another big part of the program is helping the town. The students are required to make Orosi a better place to live. The students feed the homeless. They clean up the town.  They also teach adults how to use computers. 

Emilio hopes to go to college. He hopes more education will help him have a better life.
