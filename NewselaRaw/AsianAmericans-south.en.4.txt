WASHINGTON â€” Thousands of Asian-Americans have moved away from the big cities on the U.S. coasts and headed South. They are changing the communities where they settle.

The Asian-American population in the South grew quickly between 2000 and 2010. For every 10 that were there in 2000, seven more were there in 2010. That is an increase of 70 percent.

Asian-Americans were the fastest-growing group in the South between 2000 and 2010. Their population grew faster in the South than any other part of the country. The government collected these numbers in a count of the country's population.

The South includes 16 states from Maryland to Florida to Texas. Washington, D.C., is also included in the region. In some states the Asian-American population nearly doubled between 2000 and 2010. Georgia and North Carolina grew the fastest.

## They Grew Fast, Now What?

The sudden growth presents some problems in the states. Problems with new languages are one example.

Communities now have to teach students who do not speak English as a first language. There are 111 different languages in one part of Georgia.

Some cities also want Asian-American businesses to have signs in English. It would help police go to the right place in an emergency.

Officials also have to write papers in different languages to help refugees. Also, some states in the South are not used to dealing with large groups of people from other countries.

An older Asian-American population is another challenge. Experts say the number of elderly Asian-Americans in the region is increasing. The cheaper cost of living draws them to the South after they stop working. Since they are older, they need more health care. States will have to deal with that.

The Asian-American newcomers also mean new voters in the South. Almost three times as many Asian-Americans voted in Virginia in 2012, compared with 2004.

## Many Opportunities Are There

There are many reasons for the population shift. Many different groups of Asian-Americans are moving to the South. Groups of Chinese, Indians, Koreans and Vietnamese are just some of them. The government tracks 23 different ethnic groups that it considers Asian-American.

It's hard to find one explanation for the changes. Marita Etcubanez works for an Asian-American group. She says many move to the South to find better jobs. It can also be cheaper to live in the South.

People will move where there are good opportunities, Etcubanez said. Different people will have different opportunities. Refugees from parts of Southeast Asia will have different skills than an educated worker from India.

C.N. Le, a college professor, mentioned good universities in North Carolina as a draw for educated Asian-Americans. That state had the highest increase in its Asian-American population in the region.

Some states will adjust to new communities better than others. Some states, like Tennessee, have accepted refugees for many years. They might adapt better to a changing population.

This is a new situation for many states, said Chris Kromm, a civil rights worker. "A lot of them are catching up."
