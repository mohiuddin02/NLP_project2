MIAMI, Fla. — President Barack Obama paid his first visit to the Florida Everglades on Wednesday to give an Earth Day speech. He spoke about the risk of climate change to the endangered national park and the entire nation.

But his decision to give the speech in South Florida clearly had a political goal. Voters will elect the next president in 18 months. The Republican candidates for president, including one from Florida, question whether climate change is man-made. Important scientific research has concluded that climate change, also called global warming, is mainly caused by pollution from fossil fuels like oil.

In a speech delivered at Everglades National Park, the president also got a dig in at Florida Governor Rick Scott. The governor, a Republican, has come under fire for ordering state workers to avoid the term "climate change."

"Climate change can no longer be denied … cannot be edited out of the conversation," Obama said. Scott, who turned down an invitation to join Obama in the Everglades, has denied that state workers are forbidden to use the term.

## "Everglades: River Of Grass"

Before his speech, the president and park rangers walked the Anhinga Trail, the park's most popular tourist stop. They passed baby alligators, cormorants and a pair of black vultures, which are famous for eating the rubber off visitors' vehicles.

Obama said he could think of "no better place" to spend Earth Day than the River of Grass, as the Everglades is called.

The president was also in South Florida to speak about the steps he has taken to tackle environmental problems. Most notably, his government has limited pollution and also spent $2.2 billion on a project to restore the Everglades, the administration said.

Obama was expected to reveal new conservation efforts in four areas of the country, including Southwest Florida. The National Park Service also will designate Marjory Stoneman Douglas' cottage in Florida as a national monument. Douglas is a pioneering preservationist who inspired people to restore the  Everglades with her nonfiction book, "Everglades: River of Grass."

## The Presidential Campaign

Obama's decision to focus on climate change in South Florida also could have an effect on the 2016 presidential campaign. It may pressure Republican candidates into an open discussion of the subject. The candidate from Florida, Republican Senator Marco Rubio, is skeptical that climate change is man-made. Obama's trip to Florida to warn about climate change will hardly go unnoticed in the early days of the 2016 campaign.

"This is not an effort necessarily to go to anybody's home state," White House press secretary Josh Earnest said. Earnest said Obama's speech was intended to open debate on the issue. He said that the Republicans who deny the reality of climate change only do harm to the people that they were elected to represent.

On Tuesday, Governor Scott called on the federal government to give Florida the $58 million it owes to restore the Everglades. The White House admits that the government has owed the project money since even before Obama took office. Florida is spending $1.9 billion for the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Project, nearly a billion dollars more than the federal government.

"President Obama needs to live up to his commitment on the Everglades," Scott said. He added that critical parts of the project have been delayed for more than a year.

Earnest suggested Scott make the funding request to the Republican-controlled Congress. The Republicans oppose many of the policies from President Obama, who is a Democrat.

## Preservation Becoming Critical

Obama's visit comes at a critical time for the Everglades.

Last November, Florida residents overwhelmingly voted to buy land for restoration projects. Yet state lawmakers hesitated to spend the money to buy about 46,000 acres.

Preserving the Everglades is also becoming critical as the seas are rising, which is another effect of climate change. This week, scientists announced new research that showed even more dramatic changes could occur as a result of climate change. The United Nations group predicted increases in temperature, sea level and ocean salinity, or saltiness.

Mangrove forests, which protect the Everglades against storms and floods, could disappear, studies found. Scientists predicted that soil will become more salty, allowing the ocean to flood into the Everglades, shrinking it. The Everglades wetlands, which provides much of South Florida's freshwater, are already half their original size.

Evelyn Gaiser is an ecologist at Florida International University. She was invited to meet with Obama after his speech. Gaiser said now that public recognition is growing about climate climate, she suggested that awareness about the Everglades could be an example for other natural areas around the world.
