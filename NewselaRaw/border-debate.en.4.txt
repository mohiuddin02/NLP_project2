Last summer, a huge number of children tried to enter the United States on their own. Now, far fewer children are crossing the border without permission.

Even so, it seems the government will continue to fight over immigration anyway.

On Friday, President Barack Obama said he would order changes to some immigration rules. The rules say who can come and stay in the United States.

No one knows exactly what changes Obama would make. More than 11 million people are living in the United States without permission. Experts think he may protect more than 5 million of them from being sent back to their home countries.

## The Gloves Are Coming Off

Republican lawmakers have promised to fight. They think lawmakers should be the ones to decide whether the people can stay or not. They say an order by Obama would cause the new Congress to not trust him. Lawmakers in the Senate and the House of Representatives form Congress. The two groups make the laws for the United States.

In elections earlier in November, Republicans won control over both houses of Congress. The Republicans are a political group. They disagree with Obama, a Democrat, over running the country. They especially do not agree with him over the millions of people in the United States without permission.

Democratic lawmakers mostly say the illegal immigrants should be allowed to stay. Republican lawmakers argue that border security must be tightened first. They want to stop people from coming into the United States without permission.

## Fewer Children Picked Up At The Border

On Friday, the government announced that far fewer children are crossing the border on their own. For every five children who tried to cross the border in October of 2013, there were only three who tried to cross in October this year.

The number of families trying to come to the United States illegally also decreased.

The numbers have been going down for some time, said Jeh Johnson. He is a government leader. His job is to help keep the United States safe. Johnson is also in charge of protecting the borders.

The number of illegal immigrants is at its lowest level since the 1970s, Johnson said.

The government accomplished this in several ways. Hundreds of border guards were moved to the Rio Grande Valley. The valley is in Texas. It runs along the border with Mexico. The government also tried to stop criminal gangs from sneaking people to the United States. It added more flights to send people back.

In October, the number of children trying to come on their own was the lowest in two years. Over the summer, most of the children came from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras in Central America. They were trying to join family members in the United States, Johnson said. They also came for a better life.

## President Says He Will Use His Powers

More than a year ago, The Senate passed an important bill. It would have let people work here legally and visit their home countries. However, the House of Representatives never voted on the bill, so it did not become law.

On Friday, Obama said since Congress did not do anything, he would use his powers fix the problem. He said he would "try to make the system work better."

Obama promised he would take action by the end of the year.

Republicans are angry about Obama's promise.

We are going to fight the president if he does this, said Representative John Boehner. He is a Republican from Ohio. This is the wrong way to govern, Boehner said.
