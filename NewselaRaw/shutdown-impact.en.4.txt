WASHINGTON — On Monday night Congress couldn't find a way to keep paying for the work of government. The nation is now running differently. Some government services were shut down.

Most of the country might not even notice that the government is not completely open. But many government workers and average Americans are likely to feel the effects.

At least 800,000 federal workers won't be able to work in the shutdown. At least temporarily. Those workers will not be paid until Congress agrees on a plan to pay for the government.

The State Department, for example, will have to stop giving out some passports. People need passports to travel to other countries. This will disrupt their travel plans.

## Some Crime Fighting Forced To Stop

The Treasury Department cracks down on crimes involving money. That work will have to take a break.

But the Department of Transportation said that air traffic control services will continue. That's good news for people flying. The Amtrak railroad won't be disrupted, either.

Still, nearly a third of the Transportation Department's workforce will go on leave; 18,481 of the agency's 55,468 workers. Its job of looking into accidents and dangerous materials will continue.

A shutdown won't affect the military immediately. Soldiers will get paid. But they might face delays in receiving pay if the shutdown lasts for awhile. The military can also keep operating. And its emergency police, fire and medical services will continue. But more than 300,000 workers will be put on leave. Training of defense workers will stop.

People who served in the military will still get treated at veterans hospitals.

The Department of Homeland Security will have to idle more than 30,000 of its 230,000 workers. But Border Patrol, Customs and airport security agents will be at their jobs. Their work is important to the safety of the country.

Museums and national parks will close or operate with just a few people. For a class of eighth-graders from Illinois, visiting the nation's capital meant months of raising money. They will get a tough lesson in how the government works, and doesn't.

"It's a shame because the teachers at their school put an enormous amount of effort into planning and organizing this," said Cindy Hunter, a parent. "I feel so sorry for them."

## How Some Services Are Affected

Here's how the shutdown will affect some government services:

— Social Security money sent to retired people will still go out.

— Government healthcare for people age 65 and over won't be affected. The shutdown did not affect the launch on Tuesday of the Affordable Care Act. It's the new health program also called Obamacare.

— The Internal Revenue Service will continue to collect taxes but refunds will be delayed.

— Most federal education spending won't be affected. Aid for college students will continue. But a preschool program for children from poor families may have money problems and thousands of kids may have to stay at home.

— Post offices will be open as usual.

— Most of NASA will be shut temporarily. Space agency workers who support the astronauts on the space station will keep working.

## National Mall Closed To Tourists

The Smithsonian Institution's 19 museums will close. The National Zoo in Washington will be shut.

The National Mall will be closed to tourists. It is often called the nation's front lawn. The National Air and Space Museum, National Museum of the American Indian and National Gallery of Art are located there. They will be closed.

Tours of the U.S. Capitol will not be allowed unless conducted by members of Congress.

The Statue of Liberty in New York is one of 401 national parks that will close. Philadelphia's Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell will also shut down. At Yellowstone National Park, guests in hotels and campgrounds will have 48 hours to leave.

A worker at Yellowstone said that the park was getting many phone calls. People who booked trips there could have their vacations ruined. One call came from a man whose wedding and honeymoon are planned there.

"A wedding is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. He was kind of frantic," said the worker.
