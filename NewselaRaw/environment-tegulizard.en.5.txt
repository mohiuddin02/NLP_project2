MIAMI â€”A four-foot tegu lizard does not look too dangerous. It cannot swallow a whole alligator like a Burmese python can.

But a tegu can cause a lot more harm. At least when it comes to South Florida's animals. And now it's too late to wipe them out.

Scientists first noticed Florida's tegus in 2008. Back then, the scientists thought they could get rid of them.

But they had to give up that idea. Now they just hope they can stop the lizards from spreading.

## Lizards Love Eggs

Tegus come from Argentina. The black-and-white lizards are popular as pets. The ones found in Florida were probably given up by their owners.

Scientists need to catch as many tegus as they can before October. Tegus go into hibernation then. First, they find a spot to hide. Then, they sleep for three or four months. It will be hard to find them once they're sleeping.

Scientists are worried that tegus will spread to Everglades National Park. Some already have been caught there. Tegus eat just about anything: small animals, birds, insects and plants. But what they like most is eggs. And that's a problem: baby crocodiles hatch out of eggs. Tegus might end up killing off the park's crocodiles.

It's hard to keep tegus from spreading. They enjoy South Florida's steamy heat. But they also don't mind cold weather.

## Sharp Teeth And Claws

Tegus hibernate until January or February. Then they come out to search for food. They also start to lay eggs. Mother tegus can lay 35 eggs a year.

Scientists don't know how many tegus are out there. But the numbers are going up. Trappers caught 13 tegus in 2009. Last summer they caught more than 300. And scientists captured another 140.

Tegus are hard to catch, said trapper Jake Edwards. They move very quickly. If you see one, you only have 10 seconds to grab it. Putting eggs in traps is the best way to get them.

It's not a good idea to grab a tegu with your hand, Edwards added. They have very sharp teeth and claws.

Trapper Jeff Fobb knows how mean tegus can be. "I'd rather get bit by a 10-foot snake," he said.
