IRVINE, Calif. — Janice Stanley smiles cheerfully at her polite group.

Stanley is a nurse at a hospital. She uses technology to train doctors and nurses. 

Today, she is training a group of 11- to 14-year-olds. They are not health experts, but they could be someday.

"Hi, guys," Stanley says.

Instantly, she corrects herself.

"Hi, girls!" 

They are here to earn the Girl Scouts' new My STEM Life badge.

## Companies Want To Reduce Gender Gap

The Girl Scouts are working with companies. Their plan is to reduce the "gender gap." 

The gender gap is when men and women are not equal. Not as many women work in science, technology, engineering and math. These are called STEM jobs. The problem usually starts in middle school.

When girls turn away from STEM, the gender gap becomes worse. It also prevents them from entering certain jobs. 

Stanley tells her group that women in STEM jobs earn more money. "We could be having fun and doing better for ourselves and our families."

## Wanted: Female STEM Workers

Paula Golden runs a technology company. It is working to train Girl Scouts in STEM. Golden thinks more women need to join STEM. If not, half the people in America will be left out of the most exciting jobs. Women make up half of the U.S. population.

"The way women work, think and innovate is traditionally very different from that of young men," Golden explains. 

Companies that support the My STEM Life badge have created its teaching program.

They want girls to know that STEM is used for more than just jobs with special training. It is also teaches about how all types of fun activities work, from music playlists to sandcastles.

## Learning STEM The Fun Way

The girls with Stanley learned about hospital care with the "SimMan 3G" robot. They monitored his health and heart beat.

On the technology end, they changed SimMan's breathing, turning his lips blue. They also made the robot say, "Doc, I feel like I could die," and, "Go away."

Girl Scouts also take an ocean trip. They study fish and plants, collecting small amounts for a nature group. 

So far, 300 My STEM Life badges have been awarded.

## For Girls, It's Not Always Fair

In 2012, Girl Scouts of the USA wrote a STEM report. It found that three out of four high school girls were interested in STEM. However, it also found girls are not always treated fairly in STEM classes.

Last year, educators asked Girl Scouts how schools could keep girls involved in STEM learning. One suggested, "Make sure teachers know our first names. Not just the boys' first names."

Nancy Nygren loves science. She is president of the Girl Scouts of Orange County, in Southern California.

Nygren's first job was with NASA's space shuttle program. Her next job was making computer programs. All her life, Nygren has been one of only a few girls in her job.

## More Encouragement Needed For Girls

Times are changing, but not fast enough.

More women like Nygren need to encourage girls to work in STEM.

Taylor Duzel is 12 years old. At the end of her experience at the hospital, Taylor felt more sure about becoming a doctor. 

Taylor wants to get over one problem first. The sight of blood sometimes makes her sick.

"But," Taylor says, "I think I can do it."
