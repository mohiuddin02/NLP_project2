Our distant ancestors may not have roasted marshmallows. However, telling stories and singing around a campfire may have had a big effect on their lives.

A new study says it may have expanded their minds.

Humans first learned to control fire about 400,000 years ago. It changed their lives, a researcher believes. Brain size and stomach size increased. Predators became much less of a threat. Firelight also let humans stay awake longer, according to the study.

The light of the fire changed how their bodies made a chemical called melatonin. Melatonin makes people feel sleepy when it gets dark. Firelight let people stay awake after the sun went down.

Polly Wiessner is an anthropologist. She studies how people change over time. Wiessner wondered whether this new free time let people socialize in different ways.

## Between Day And Night

Wiessner argues that conversations at night around a fire are different than during the day. She published her study on Monday.

"I think people are much more open at night by a fire," said Wiessner. She teaches at the University of Utah.

In 1974, Wiessner recorded conversations among the Ju/'hoansi Bushmen. The Bushmen are a group of people who hunt animals and gather wild berries and plants to eat. They live in a vast area of 124 miles in southwestern Africa. Their lives have changed since the 1970s. Now, they get only a small amount of food from hunting and gathering.

Wiessner originally hoped to learn how they made and kept friends across such a large area. Recently, she listened again to the recordings. Their conversations were different during the day and night. Between 2011 and 2013, Weissner returned to Africa. She recorded stories from people she had met in the 1970s.

## Telling Their Stories

The new conversations took place between at least four or five adults. They lasted for 20 to 30 minutes. She recorded 122 conversations during the day. In nearly one out of three, people talked about technology or searching for food. Another third of the conversations were pretty harsh. People complained, disapproved or argued with others. Joking made up about one out of six of the conversations. Very few told stories.

At night, however, the Ju/'hoansi Bushmen gathered around a fire. Then they spent most of their time telling stories.

"During the day, the conversation was kind of nasty a lot of the time," Wiessner said. "But at night they would mellow out and talk about the past."

They told stories mainly about the adventures of people they knew. The stories were full of information about their lives. From these stories, the Bushmen became more empathetic, Wiessner said. In other words, they better understood how others thought and felt.

Wiessner does not think that the lives of the Ju/'hoansi in the 1970s were the same as our early ancestors. However, like them, our ancestors were hunters and gathers. By learning about the Bushmen, anthropologists can imagine how our ancestors lived hundreds of thousands of years ago.

## The Warmth Of A Fire

Next, Wiessner would like to examine the effect of firelight on our bodies. She hopes to measure what happens when we relax and talk by the fire.

Wiessner would also like to know something else. Does the lack of firelight and storytelling time in our own lives make us less empathetic?

Many of us enjoy the warmth of a fire. We love candlelit dinners, fireplaces with big fires, or making s'mores during a family camping trip.

Today, electricity has largely replaced firelight. Yet, our nights are still often spent listening to stories. We watch these stories on television or read them in books, although that seems to be changing.

Like hunter-gatherers, stories help us use our imaginations and gain new ideas, she wrote. Even so, she added, electric lights and computers make it possible to work all the time. They are replacing social and story time.
