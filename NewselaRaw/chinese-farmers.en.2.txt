BEIJING — When Ma Wenfeng was a boy, the last thing he dreamed of was becoming a farmer. His father earned next to nothing growing wheat and corn. The family was so poor it mainly ate mantou, a kind of plain steamed bread.

Now it is his greatest ambition to start a farm — but not in China. In his country, the word "farmer" is synonymous with "peasant." Most Chinese farms are small and inefficient, and are tilled by impoverished farmers long past retirement age.

More and more the Chinese are looking abroad, hoping to find big stretches of good farmland to use. They have turned their attention to many far-off places: the United States, Chile, Brazil, Russia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Australia, and various African countries.

"We're the world's fastest-growing economy, with a huge demand for agricultural products," said Ma, an agricultural analyst. "When we look overseas, we see large tracts of land where you can operate a farm."

## Polluting Or Paving Its Farmland

Chinese interest in overseas farmland makes perfect sense from an economic point of view. China has 20 percent of the world's population, but just 9 percent of its usable agricultural land.

"Throughout Chinese history, our land was never enough," said Tian Zhihong, a professor of international agriculture.

China suffers from frequent droughts and much of its land is gradually becoming desert. In recent years, it has added to its problems by polluting the land or paving it over.

Eight million acres of Chinese farmland are now too polluted for farming. Those areas add up to roughly 2 percent of the country's total agricultural land.

A series of well-publicized problems with Chinese food have made many Chinese prefer foreign-grown imports. These problems have involved everything from contaminated rice to exploding watermelon. Both of those particular problems were caused by the use of too much fertilizer.

"We want to bring American sunshine, land and water back to China," said Zhang Renwu, who owns two farms in Utah.

## From Blueberries To Pork To Cotton

Chinese companies are buying up farmland wherever they can. Many countries ban the sale of land to foreigners, but this has not been a major obstacle. Where land sales are prohibited, Chinese companies have been forming partnerships with local companies.

Last year, China's largest pork producer, Shuanghui International, acquired a vast amount of U.S. farmland: more than 100,000 acres in Missouri, Texas and North Carolina. It bought its U.S. counterpart Smithfield Foods.

In Australia, a group of Chinese-led companies acquired a sprawling 200,000-acre cotton plantation. This is said to have the largest irrigation system in the Southern Hemisphere.

In Chile, the Chinese company Joyvio is growing blueberries, kiwis and grapes, and is now looking to expand.

The focus on overseas farming is controversial both at home and abroad. The Chinese government has been criticized for allowing too much farmland to be paved over for apartments and shopping malls. It also has been blamed for dragging its feet when it comes to modernizing domestic agriculture.

Worldwide in 2012, there were at least 54 Chinese agricultural projects outside the country. Together these accounted for almost 12 million acres.

## A Dragon Devouring?

China's overseas farming projects take many forms. Large state-owned companies are buying or setting up plantations in Tanzania, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Zambia, and other African countries. These plantations are growing corn, rice, cassava and sesame. Some of these products are sold locally, and some are exported to China.

Smaller privately owned Chinese businesses have been active in Russia. Unable to buy land outright, they rent farmland as part of a deal with Moscow. Unlike in Africa, where the employees are local, Chinese workers have crossed the border into Russia as well.

China's interest in farmland often worries other countries, however. For many, it conjures up visions of a dragon devouring the world's food to feed its 1.3 billion people.

This past September, for example, claims about a Chinese company made many upset. The company was said to be planning to farm up to 11,562 square miles of Ukraine.

A farm that size would account for an area almost as large as Belgium or Maryland. And the location was particularly disturbing: Ukraine, which borders Russia, has long been known as the breadbasket of Europe.

Britain's Daily Telegraph ran a startling headline: "China 'land grab' sees it given control of 5 percent of Ukraine."

The Chinese company in question, Xinjiang Production &amp; Construction, quickly denied the claims. The arrangement, however, has proceeded — but with a far smaller amount of land being farmed under a 50-year rental agreement.

## Controversy In Africa

China's activities in Africa have been particularly controversial. Some have accused the Chinese of taking advantage of the much-colonized continent.

"Zimbabwe now a full-fledged Chinese colony," read a headline in the Zimbabwe Mail in November. The article pointed to large Chinese-owned wheat, soybean and tobacco fields in the country.

China is far from the world leader when it comes to overseas farmland, however: The United States still ranks first. And Britain, South Korea, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Singapore all hold more than China, or around as much.

But China is closing the gap fast. In 2012, it controlled almost twice as much overseas farmland as it did two years earlier.

"It is only the last two years that the big agricultural companies are going overseas in a big way," said Ma, the agricultural analyst. "I think you will see much more."
