In 1493, Christopher Columbus returned to Europe with much astounding news and a pocket full of corn seeds. He had learned about many things during his travels to the New World, but few were as exciting as the promising grain he had encountered for the first time. It was delicious, Columbus said, and could help feed a lot of people.

The only problem was that Columbus had left behind a fairly important bit of information. "He didn't take back the knowledge of how to process it," said Betty Fussell, the author of "The Story of Corn," which chronicles the grain's several-thousand-year history. His seemingly small omission "probably changed the course of history."

Over the next few hundred years, most of Europe grew to misunderstand corn rather than embrace it. Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, the story of the grain followed a different path: Corn thrived, and eventually found its way to the very center of the American diet.

Today, the United States is the largest producer and consumer of corn — and by a long shot. Corn is in the sodas Americans drink and the potato chips they snack on. It is in hamburgers and french fries, sauces and salad dressings, baked goods, breakfast cereals, virtually all poultry, and even most fish. The grain is so widely used that it would take longer to list the foods that contain traces of it than to pinpoint the ones that do not. "Our entire diet has been colonized by this one plant," journalist and food expert Michael Pollan remarked in 2003.

## Mass Production Boosted Popularity

Corn was not always so omnipresent, however. It took time for European settlers to warm to it.

Until the 1800s, corn was eaten mostly by the poor. It was a cheap and easy-to-grow crop, consumed by farmers and fed to prisoners. Slowly but surely, however, the grain made its way onto the dining tables of families all over the country.

In the 1920s and 1930s, scientists discovered a way to boost corn production to a level that was previously unthinkable. They bred new strains that had larger ears and could be grown closer together, which allowed farmers to produce a lot more corn without more land.

In the following decades, "the number of bushels of corn per acre doubled, and then continued to rise each year," as Paul Roberts wrote in his 2009 book "The End of Food." Corn yields have continued to rise ever since.

## Crop Is Very Inexpensive

Above all, what has allowed corn to seep into just about every food Americans eat today is the fact that it is so inexpensive.

At present, a bushel of corn costs about $4 — much less than soybeans or wheat — and the price is falling.

The most striking thing about the corn grown in America today is how little of it we actually eat.

Less than 10 percent of the corn used in the United States is directly ingested by humans. The bulk is either turned into ethanol, for use as fuel, or fed to the hundreds of millions of animals we raise. Cows, chickens, pigs and even fish, which are fed pellets made largely of corn, eat several times the amount of the grain people consume each year.

## Three Main Types Of Corn

There are many kinds of corn, but the most common forms can be divided into three general types.

The first is sweet corn, which Americans grill on the cob in the summer, and boil or bake during the rest of the year. The most beloved variety, it accounts for only about 1 percent of the corn grown in America.

Flint corn, which has a soft center and harder outer shell, is what most people know as popcorn. It became popular in the 1960s after Jiffy Pop, which cooked the kernels in aluminum foil on the stovetop, was introduced. Its popularity rose further in the 1970s and 1980s, shortly after the introduction of the microwave. Today, much like sweet corn, flint accounts for a steady but comparatively tiny portion of the U.S. corn crop.

## Invisible, But Found Everywhere

Then there is dent corn, also known as field corn, which is the most important kind. It accounts for the vast majority of corn grown in America today, as well as the vast majority of the corn Americans eat indirectly. It is in most animals we eat, because it is fed to most animals we raise for slaughter. It is in most of the beverages we drink, because high-fructose corn syrup, which is derived from field corn, is the most commonly used commercial sweetener. It is even in our cheese, because our cows munch on it instead of grazing on grass.

It is largely invisible, in other words, but also absolutely central to the American diet.

"It's in almost every product in the supermarket today," Fussell said.

Corn never did became popular on European dining tables. As American-style processed foods spread around the world, however, cheap corn is spreading too, and finding its way into stomachs everywhere.
