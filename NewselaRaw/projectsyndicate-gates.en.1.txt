SEATTLE, Wash. – A few years ago, my wife Melinda and I visited with a group of rice farmers in Bihar, India, one of the most flood-prone regions of the country. All of them were extremely poor. They depended on the rice they grew to feed and support their families. When the monsoon rains arrived each year, the rivers would swell, threatening to flood their farms.

Often, their crops would be ruined, and they would flee to the cities in search of odd jobs to feed their families. By the next year, however, they would return – often poorer than when they left – ready to plant again.

Our visit was a powerful reminder that for the world's poorest farmers, life is a high-wire act – without safety nets. They don't have access to improved seeds, fertilizer, irrigation systems, and other helpful technologies, as farmers in rich countries do. They also have no crop insurance, either. If they could buy insurance, they would receive money if floods happen or crops are lost. Because they cannot, just one stroke of bad fortune – a drought, a flood or an illness – could push them deeper into poverty and hunger.

## Climate Change Adds New Risks

Now, climate change is set to add a new risk to their lives. Rising temperatures in the decades ahead will lead to major disruptions in agriculture, particularly in tropical zones. Crops won't grow because of too little rain or too much rain. Pests will thrive in the warmer climate and destroy crops.

Farmers in wealthier countries will experience changes, too. But they have the tools and support to manage these risks. The world's poorest farmers are likely to suffer the most.

At the same time, the world needs their help to feed a growing population. By 2050, global food demand is expected to increase by 60 percent. Declining harvests would strain the global food system and increase hunger.

I'm optimistic. I think we can avoid the worst impacts of climate change and feed the world — if we act now. There's an urgent need for governments to invest in new clean-energy innovations that will dramatically reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and halt rising temperatures, both products of climate change. At the same time, we need to recognize that it's already too late to stop all of the impacts of hotter temperatures. Even if the world discovered a cheap, clean energy source next week, it would take time for humans to stop using oil, coal and gas. That's why it's critical for the world to invest in efforts to help the poorest adapt.

## Necessary New Tools Are Simple

Many of the tools they'll need are quite basic. They need to borrow money, and they need to get better seeds, fertilizer and training. They also need markets where they can sell what they grow.

Other tools are new and meant to help manage a changing climate. The Gates Foundation and its partners have worked together to develop new varieties of seeds that grow even during times of drought or flooding. The rice farmers I met in Bihar, for instance, are now growing a new variety of flood-tolerant rice – nicknamed "scuba" rice. It can survive two weeks underwater. Most rice would die and famers' crops would be lost if there were a flood. Now, the farmers are prepared if shifts in the weather pattern bring more flooding to their region. Other rice varieties are being developed that can withstand drought, heat, cold, and soil problems like high salt contamination.

All of these efforts have the power to transform lives. It's quite common to see these farmers double or triple their harvests and their incomes when they have access to the tools farmers have in the rich world. This new prosperity allows them to improve their diets, invest in their farms and send their children to school.

There will also be threats from climate change that we can't foresee. To be prepared, the world needs to accelerate research into seeds and support smallholder farmers — typically farmers with a small plot of land that support a single family. One of the most exciting innovations to help farmers is satellite technology. In Africa, researchers are using satellite images to create detailed soil maps, which can inform farmers about what plant varieties will thrive on their land.

## Can Africa Feed Itself?

Still, we need to get those better seeds and new technologies into the hands of farming families. A number of organizations, including a non-profit group called One Acre Fund, are finding ways to ensure that farmers take advantage of these solutions. One Acre Fund works closely with more than 200,000 African farmers. It provides them with access to financing, tools and training. By 2020, they aim to reach one million farmers.

Melinda and I have made a bet that Africa will be able to feed itself in the next 15 years. Even with the risks of climate change, that's a bet I stand by.

I know the world has what it takes to help put those pieces in place for both the challenges they face today and the ones they'll face tomorrow. Most importantly, I know the farmers do, too.
