MIAMI â€” Early in 2014, officials noticed something unusual at the United States border with Mexico. Tens of thousands of children were crossing from Mexico to the U.S. They were crossing without permission. They were also crossing without their parents.

The news shocked the country. At least 51,705 children and teenagers from Central America entered the United States illegally in 2014. It was more than twice as many as the year before.

Places to live were eventually found for most of the children. More than 3,100 are now living in South Florida.

## Some Are Doing Well, Some Have Big Problems

Fewer children are crossing the border now. Some of the children who crossed the border last year are doing well. Others are dealing with big problems.

Many people who cross into the U.S. without permission cannot stay. They will have to go back to the country they came from.

Nora Sandigo said she thinks half the children have been allowed to stay. Sandigo leads a group that supports immigrants. The group helps people who came from other countries to live in the U.S.

Sandigo said one problem is there are not enough lawyers. Lawyers would help more children fight to stay in the U.S. There is also not enough money going to public schools. The schools have to teach and provide lunch and help for the children.

## Many Parents Lack Papers

Francisco Portillo is president of another group. It is called Francisco Morazan Honduran Organization. He agreed with Sandigo. He also said U.S. officials also have gotten tougher on many of the children's parents. Those parents do not have papers showing they have permission to be in the country, he said.

Jose Cruz is a Cuban-American who used to be a priest. He helped young Cubans who came the U.S. in the 1960s. He said the Central American children have a big problem. Cruz and two other Cuban-Americans have formed the Peter Pan Border Operation. The group helps Central American children find homes and support in the U.S.

Cruz said nine of every 10 of the boys and girls do not have someone watching over them. They also do not have help with money.

Cruz said he is also concerned that some of the children may be living in homes that have too many people. Others may be forced to work to support their families. Some also have trouble in school. They don't know English and don't eat well, he said.

## Big Health Concerns

Dr. Jorge Herrera is president of the group. He said he also is worried about the children's overall health. They do not have insurance, which would pay the costs if the get sick. They also do not get regular health care, he said.

Cruz and Herrera have asked the White House to let them take charge of Central American children in the U.S. They have also asked for money to help them do this.

The White House has not responded yet, Cruz said.

## Schools Have Welcomed The Children

John Schuster works for the Miami-Dade County public schools. Schuster said the Central American children have been welcomed at school. They are adjusting as well as can be expected, he said.

Overall, Schuster said, the children may be facing problems. The problems are not at school, though, he said.

Schuster said the children are far away from their homes and families.
