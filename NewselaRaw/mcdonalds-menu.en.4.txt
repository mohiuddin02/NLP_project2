Want a burger off a fast-food dollar menu? Better have more than a dollar.

McDonald's is changing its Dollar Menu. The menu offered burgers and other food for less than a dollar each. It did so for more than 10 years. McDonald's sells a lot of food from the popular menu.

But soon, the menu will change. McDonald's is calling it the Dollar Menu &amp; More. It will have the $1 items. But there will also be $2 foods and $5 family meals.

The fast-food giant isn't the only one making a change.

## Higher Costs Doom Dollar Deal

Costs are going up. People's tastes are changing. So prices are being pushed above a dollar. People also want better ingredients. So the dollar deal may be doomed.

Wendy's used to have a 99-cent bargain menu. In January, it became the Right Price Right Size menu. It has items that cost as much as $2. The Burger King value menu recently included a limited-time Whopper Jr. deal. It cost $1.29.

John Gordon's job is to study the restaurant business. He said dollar menus will have to change. Talking about the dollar too much is not good. It makes customers think a restaurant isn't as good over time, he said.

More chains are experimenting with prices. They offer different levels of deals. There isn't just a flat menu of super-cheap options. Restaurants have raised prices to cover higher food costs. Other costs are also going up. Some favorites have moved above a dollar.

Restaurants may also raise prices if their health care costs go up. Some restaurants have to pay for their workers to have health care.

Higher pay for workers is another problem for the fast-food outlets. California will raise the minimum wage in the state to $10 an hour by Jan. 1, 2016. That is up from $8 per hour. The [minimum wage](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=minimum+wage) is the lowest amount a company can pay a worker. Gordon said that move probably will push the fast-food industry to raise the lowest prices to above a dollar.

## People Want Healthier Food

Prices for fast food are rising. But consumers also have begun questioning the quality of low-cost menus. Those menus rarely include fruits and vegetables.

A company called NPD tracks how people buy things. NPD found that low-cost menu orders at fast-food restaurants fell in 2011 and 2012. Sales of combo meals are also down in the past five years.

McDonald's is trying to bring back health-minded customers. The company plans to offer salads, fruit or vegetables in value meals in some cities. Customers can still order french fries, though.

Other companies are trying other ideas. Burger King last summer launched a $1 burger. It's stuffed with french fries.

KFC last month started selling the Go Cup. It's for people who more and more are eating small snacks while they drive. The container contains seasoned potato wedges and chicken for less than $3. It fits in the cup holder of a car.

KFC may be on the right track. A meal can still be convenient even if it costs more than a dollar, said William McCarthy. He teaches health at the University of California. People want to save money and have something easy to eat when they buy fast food, he said.
