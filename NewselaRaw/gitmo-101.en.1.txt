WASHINGTON â€“ As a candidate, Barack Obama pledged that he would close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. He found that this was easier said than done. As president, Obama has failed to shut down the facility he calls "expensive" and "inefficient," and a "recruitment tool for terrorists." On April 30, Obama promised that he will go back to the Guantanamo problem, which frustrated him during his first term. His pledge raises many questions, some easier to answer than others.

## Q: How long has the Guantanamo detention center been around?

A: Then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld announced on Dec. 27, 2001, that some prisoners captured in Afghanistan would be held at the 45-square-mile U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The first 20 detainees arrived Jan. 11, 2002.

## Q: Why send the detainees to Guantanamo?

A: According to a report by researchers at the Constitution Project, Pentagon officials considered a variety of Pacific islands and other remote locations for holding men captured during the so-called war on terrorism that President George W. Bush declared after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks on U.S. soil. Officials eventually turned to Guantanamo, which previously had been used to house Haitians and Cubans who had been picked up on the high seas trying to reach the United States. Officials thought Guantanamo's limited access would solve the question of security. Also, since it is part of Cuba, the men held there would not be able to access U.S. federal courts. The Supreme Court eventually rejected that argument and allowed the detainees to challenge their imprisonment.

## Q: Who is being held at Guantanamo?

A: Currently, 166 men are detained there, more than half of them from Yemen. Three of the 166 have been convicted of crimes by a military court, seven have been charged with crimes - including the five accused of conspiring in the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon - and 24 may face criminal charges. Another 86 have been cleared for release or transfer to other countries. Also, 46 face no criminal charges, but a review of their cases found them to be too dangerous to release. At its peak, in May 2003, the facility held about 680 men.

## Q: Why are they called detainees rather than prisoners?

A: The Pentagon says it uses the term for most of the men because they have not been convicted of crimes.

## Q: What are the conditions there like?

A: When the first detainees arrived, they were housed in wire enclosures that looked like a backyard dog kennel. Now most detainees are in air-conditioned buildings, styled after a maximum-security prison in the United States. The buildings are called camps, though they have little in common with the image that word conjures. Until recently, most of the detainees were in Camp 6, where they were allowed to keep their cell doors open and move freely in a common area where they could watch television and eat together. But in April, in response to detainees' covering cameras used to monitor them, the guards forced all the prisoners back into their 6.8-foot-by-12-foot cells. The most secret of the facilities, Camp 7, holds an estimated 15 of the detainees, including those accused of planning the 9/11 attacks. As of Monday, 100 detainees were refusing food; 23 of those are force-fed twice a day through tubes snaked up their noses and down their throats.

## Q: What rules apply to how they are treated?

A: The United States characterizes most as "unprivileged enemy belligerents," rather than prisoners of war. Still, detainees are supposed to be treated according to the Geneva Conventions, which prohibits  "outrages upon personal dignity." Congress also has specified certain standards, such as a law that prohibits "cruel, inhuman or degrading" treatment, and requires that interrogations follow normal U.S. Army standards.

## Q: Does the U.S. Constitution apply to detainees at Guantanamo?

A: To a degree. The Supreme Court ruled in a 2008 decision that Guantanamo detainees had the same constitutional right to file a habeas corpus petition as prisoners in the United States. Although Cuba owns the Guantanamo land, the Supreme Court noted, the United States has exercised complete control for more than 100 years.  The justices decided that meant it was essentially part of the United States.

## Q: How much does Guantanamo cost to operate?

A: The White House said it spends about $150 million per year to run Guantanamo. That works out to about $800,000 per prisoner. It costs about $30,000 a year to keep someone at a regular prison in the United States. The Bush and Obama administrations also have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to upgrade the facility.

## Q: What is stopping Obama from closing it and moving the men to U.S. prisons?

A: Since 2009, Congress has made it difficult for the Obama administration to transfer men out of Guantanamo. One law prohibits using military funds to transfer detainees to the United States. It also prohibits transfers to foreign countries unless the secretary of defense certifies that the country meets certain standards, including that it is not "facing a threat" that could make it hard for the U.S. to keep track of the individual. That is a problem for a shaky country like Yemen, which has an active al-Qaida branch. Obama ordered a halt to all transfers to Yemen after a Nigerian who said he had been recruited in Yemen tried to blow up a Detroit-bound plane. That has held up the release of 26 Yemenis who have been approved for transfer and 30 more people.

## Q: How many released Guantanamo detainees have returned to fighting the United States?

A: This is a hotly debated topic. In January, the director of national intelligence reported on the 603 men who had been transferred out of Guantanamo. The report found that 97 were "confirmed of re-engaging" against U.S. forces, of which about half were dead or back in custody. Another 72 were "suspected of re-engaging" against U.S. forces, though there was no explanation of what evidence led to the suspicion.
