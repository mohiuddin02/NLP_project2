COMBINED LOCKS, Wis. — Glen and Margaret Martin have put some pumpkins in their front yard to celebrate autumn and Halloween.

The Martins' pumpkins are a bit strange. They look like something from a science-fiction movie. They are humongous!

The pumpkins weigh more than 1,700 pounds each. Even so, they are not the biggest pumpkins grown in Wisconsin this year. Glen Martin knows this because he is president of Wisconsin Giant Pumpkin Growers. They are a group of gardeners who are not satisfied with regular-sized pumpkins.

Wisconsin is home to many giant-pumpkin growers. It ranks fifth in giant-pumpkin winners, according to the Great Pumpkin Commonwealth, a group that runs contests for giant pumpkins.

"It's in our blood here. That comes from our dairy farming background in Wisconsin," Glen Martin said. "It's like taking care of a calf — you have to take care of it every day."

## Giant Pumpkins Take Over

Wisconsin Giant Pumpkin Growers started 20 years ago with 14 growers. The group now has 120 members. It meets regularly to discuss competitions and schedule classes on pumpkin growing.

"As with many things in Wisconsin, it started in a bar," Martin said. "A bunch of guys standing around saying, 'I can grow a bigger pumpkin.'"

Group members pay $25 to join and get a how-to booklet, a packet of seeds and a list of growers. Every July, the group organizes a free pumpkin patch tour for the public, so people can see the giant pumpkins covering the ground.

Giant pumpkins grow so fast, you can almost watch them expand.

The vines can grow 6 inches a day and the pumpkins themselves can add 2 pounds per hour.

## That One Special Seed

The pumpkins begin as Atlantic Giant pumpkin seeds. Many giant-pumpkin owners produce their own seeds or get seeds from prize-winning pumpkins. Just because the pumpkins are huge doesn't mean they are filled with thousands of seeds — many have only 100 to 200.

Seeds from huge pumpkins can sell for as much as $500 each. Chris Stevens of New Richmond, Wisconsin, sold one seed from his 2010 world record pumpkin at a charity auction for $1,600. But in the world of giant-pumpkin growing, most seeds are swapped or given away.

In 2010, Stevens grew a 1,810-pound giant that broke the world record. Since then, he has been chasing the record again. It's been broken nine out of the past 10 years.

The world record was broken again this year by a 2,096-pound pumpkin from Switzerland.

## Bring On The Challenge

It's not easy to grow a giant pumpkin. The process starts in April, when seeds are planted in small pots. They are grown indoors for two weeks before they are put into the ground.

Gardeners must think ahead and leave room for the long vine and giant fruit. A plot of earth for one giant pumpkin is generally about 25 feet by 35 feet.

A pumpkin vine will often produce many flowers that could become pumpkins. The growers remove all flowers but one, to focus all the plant's energy on making one ridiculously large pumpkin, said Irwin Goldman. He runs the Department of Horticulture, or plant science, at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Growing a giant pumpkin is "actually a bit of a challenge," Goldman said.

Goldman and fellow University of Wisconsin professor James Nienhuis have grown giant pumpkins for several years. Their pumpkins are smaller, only 400 pounds. Still, that's big enough to carve them into boats. Students race the pumpkin boats each year on Lake Mendota in what's called the Giant Pumpkin Regatta.

## The Giants Keep Getting Bigger

One of Nienhuis' students made a chart of record-setting giant pumpkins dating back to 1950 and learned each year the winner has gone up an average of 20 to 30 pounds.

Nienhuis explained that selection — choosing seeds from the biggest pumpkins — is one reason that the fruits have gotten bigger. Another reason is the environment where they are grown.

"Wisconsin is a good place to grow them," Nienhuis said. "They grow best where you have large bodies of water with high humidity."

Growers of prize-winning pumpkins can bring home prize money and bragging rights, but they say the true rewards are something different altogether. They enjoy seeing the looks on strangers' faces when they spot the giant pumpkins. Eyes grow wide. Mouths drop open.

"This time of year when you're hauling them in your trailer, people think it's just absolutely amazing," Stevens said.
