San Francisco has sent workers to this area to help the homeless. If the plan works, the homeless will go to shelters where they can find help.

Jennifer Friedenbach works in San Francisco. Her job is to help stop homelessness. "When a lot of cameras are going to be pointed on the city, they want to have an image of the city that does not include poverty," said Friedenbach. She said that the city wants to move poor people away from Super Bowl City. They want it to look like San Francisco does not have too many poor people, Friedenbach said.

## Village Will Be Shown On TV

Homelessness in San Francisco is a big problem. It has gotten worse lately. Thousands of workers have moved into the city. They have good jobs that pay a good amount of money. It has raised housing costs to some of the highest in the United States. The city now has the eighth-worst homeless rate in the nation.

Starting on Jan. 30, there will be four security checkpoints to get into the Super Bowl City area. The CBS television network will broadcast from the village.

David Perry works to get the city ready for the Super Bowl. At a community meeting, he said that they will be working more than usual in the next few weeks. He said that teams will be out to help homeless people. He also said that San Francisco wants to make the Super Bowl safe and clean for everyone.

## Workers Tell Homeless About Plan

Jane Kim also works to help get the city ready for the Super Bowl. The mayor's office sent a message to her team. The city is only helping the homeless because of the Super Bowl, she said.

The city should offer help all the time, Kim said. It should not help only when it expects lots of visitors come to town.

Rachael Kagan works for the city's health department. She said that the homeless are not being asked to leave. Instead, workers have told the homeless that changes are coming. There will be construction and crowds. Things will be different for a few weeks, and the homeless should know that. 

Christine Falvey works for the mayor. She said homeless people are being offered shelter because of the winter weather. Falvey said the city is not helping the homeless just because of the Super Bowl.

## Street Life Called "Unhealthy"

"It's associated with cold, wet winter," Falvey said. "It is dangerous and unhealthy to live on our streets."

Christopher James, 33, is homeless in San Francisco. He said he has not been offered help. If he were, he does not know where he would go.

"Shelters are nasty," James said.

San Francisco is the 13th-biggest U.S. city by population. It ranks number 8 nationwide in the number of homeless. Most of the homeless do not live in shelters, according to a report from the U.S. government.

Jackie Jenks works at Hospitality House, based in San Francisco. Hospitality House runs a shelter for 30 men. She said there are 500 to 700 people on the waiting list for shelter at any given time.
