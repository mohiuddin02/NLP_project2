WASHINGTON — Texas cattleman Bob McCan wants nothing to do with the U.S. government's latest meat-labeling rules.

Letting shoppers know what country their meat comes from is something a lot of people say that they want.

But McCan's herd of roughly 4,000 includes cattle from Mexico. If the beef has to be labeled, he has to separate the animals when he sells them. There is no good reason for that, he said. It would just cost him and others millions of dollars more to handle the cattle. Those costs would get passed on. Beef would cost more at the grocery store.

"We don't want beef to become a luxury item," said McCan, a fifth-generation rancher.
## Consumers Have Right To Know

McCan is the president-elect of a group that represents cattle producers. The ranchers and meat companies have sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture for moving ahead in late May with new labeling rules. The regulations require that the country where the cattle came from be included on beef packages.

The groups claim the labels will hurt beef exports and are unconstitutional.

People who like the new rules say the labeling will not cost too much. They are ready to fight the cattle producers.

"They're totally wrong — consumers have the right to know where products are from," said Joel Joseph of the Made in the USA Foundation.The group promotes labeling and products made in the United States. Labeling where meat comes from is the same as labeling where a new car's engine comes from, he said.

If McCan does not want to have to separate his cattle, "then he shouldn't get cattle from Mexico," he said.

McCan said whether the beef is labeled is a matter of how ranchers try to sell their beef. The government should leave it alone.

"We're not anti-labeling at all," he said.

Cattle producers aren't the only unhappy ones.
## Rules Could Start Trade Fight

The new labeling rules also could ignite a fight with Canada. The neighbor to the north is threatening to fight back.

The Canadian government said the new rules make it harder for foreign products to be sold in the United States. It said it might respond by putting tariffs, or import charges, on products like pork, pasta, chocolate, cheese, office furniture and many others. The Canadian government fears that its beef exports to the United States would decline under the new rules.

Canadian officials immediately complained to the World Trade Organization. The WTO hears trade fights between countries.

The Agriculture Department is caught in the middle. Groups that favor labeling sued the department last year. They accused the government of dragging its feet on putting new rules in place.

For consumer groups, the labeling fight never ends. They are surprised by this, because people say they like labeling.

"I thought we were done with it, and all of a sudden it's still going on," said Chris Waldrop of the Consumer Federation of America.

A Consumer Federation poll in May said that 90 percent of Americans think packages should have to say where meat comes from.
## Consumers Care More About Price

McCan is not convinced.

"They might say they care, but most of them really don't care what country it comes from. Beef is beef," he said.

John Masswohl, director of government and international relations for the Canadian Cattlemen's Association, said consumers care more about price. The new rules would cost Canadian cattle producers $90 to $100 per animal, he said.

The new labels will say what countries the animals were born in, raised and killed. U.S. government officials say the new rules are legal and comply with WTO concerns.

But critics say the new rules did nothing to end discrimination against cattle from outside the United States.
## U.S. Meat Called Safer

Cattle producers say the new rules will be particularly hard for ranchers and meat companies in states like Texas that are next to other countries. Texas is the state that sells the most beef to other countries.

McCan said he has sold cattle from Mexico for a long time. His ranch is just three hours from Mexico.

"They're clean animals and their health is good," he said. Cattle from Mexico get heavily tested and treated. "There's no safety concerns with those cattle coming in from Mexico. If anything, they're even safer."

But Joseph said labeling is both a health and safety concern for American consumers. They trust U.S. products more. His Made in the USA Foundation had urged the USDA to pass the new rules.

"You're getting a better product when you get American goods of any type," he said. U.S. food is safer and cleaner, he said.
