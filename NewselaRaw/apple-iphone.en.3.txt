CUPERTINO, Calif.  â€” Apple took the cover off two separate types of the latest iPhones Tuesday. The company once changed the smartphone industry. Now it hopes the new iPhones will help it close the gap on Samsung, which sells more phones.

One of the iPhones was cheaper and made of plastic. The other aims to be "the gold standard of smartphones." And it reads your fingerprint.

Apple introduced the iPhones during an event at its Cupertino, Calif., headquarters. The move comes as the company tries to catch up to Samsung. It also needs to keep ahead of other companies in a very competitive smartphone market. The phones will be available on Sept. 20.

People in China and other parts of the world cannot spend as much money on new electronics. The iPhone 5C costs less. It may help Apple sell more phones in those places.

## Higher-Than-Expected Price Tag

Research firm Gartner Inc. said that Apple sold 14.4 percent of the world's smartphones from April through June. Samsung led the industry with 31.7 percent.

The lower-cost iPhone 5C will be sold in five colors . They are green, blue, yellow, pink and white. The 5C has a 4-inch screen. The rear cover lights up.

The iPhone 5C will cost $99 for a model with less memory and $199 for one with more memory. Those prices are only good if you have a two-year wireless contract.

Jefferies analyst Peter Misek called the phones "lovely." But even the lowest $99 price for the 5C "is higher than expected and still leaves Apple" less attractive to people looking to spend less, he said.

Without a contract, the 5C costs $549 and $649 depending on memory size.

## More Health And Fitness Apps

The second phone is the 5S. It is "the most forward-looking phone we have ever created," said Phil Schiller. He is an executive at Apple. It will come in silver, gold and "space gray" and has electronics inside than can work twice as fast as the A6.

Schiller said the new phone can run more health and fitness programs. These apps have become increasingly popular. More people are using them to track exercise, how much they eat and even sleep patterns.

The camera in the 5S received some major upgrades, including several automatic features designed to produce better photos. It can capture more light. The phone also has a "true-tone" flash feature. The flash is designed not to clash with the colors in the room or a person's skin color. Schiller said this has not been done on a phone before.

The camera, called iSight, is designed to  help avoid blurry pictures. It also has a slow-motion camera for video. A "burst mode" can take 10 frames per second as long as you hold your finger on the button. Then it finds the best one to store.

The 5S also includes "Touch ID," which reads fingerprints, Schiller said. The 5S learns about your fingerprint. Then you can just touch the home button to unlock the phone. The company said fingerprints will not be stored on Apple's computer servers.

Tying the fingerprint scanner to how people pay for things could also open new ways for Apple to make money.

## High Hopes For iOS 7 System

Both models will be on sale on Sept. 20 in the U.S., Australia, China, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Singapore and the U.K.

Apple said this is the first time that a new phone has been available right away in China. This is a sign of the growing importance of that market to the company.

The 5S will cost $199 , $299 or $399. The price depends on how much memory the phone has. You have to have a two-year contract with a cellphone company to get the price.

Apple also said its next mobile operating system, iOS 7, will be available as a free download on Sept. 18. The operating system manages how the phone works and how apps work on it.

The new system can be downloaded on the iPhone 4 and later models, as well as on the tablets beginning with the iPad 2.

Apple also said that it expects to ship its 700 millionth iOS device next month.

Apple CEO Tim Cook predicts that iOS 7 will become the most popular mobile operating system in the world. Investors seemed unimpressed. Apple's stock price fell $11.60, or 2.3 percent, to close Tuesday's trading at $494.58 per share.
