LONDON â€” A scientist says he may have solved the mystery of the Abominable Snowman. The ape-like creature is rumored to live in the Himalayan mountains but is hard to pin down. The scientist thinks the legendary animal is actually a bear.

He ran tests on the creature, also known as the Yeti. They suggest it is the descendant of an ancient polar bear.

Professor Bryan Sykes studied genes from two Himalayan animals known as Yetis. Genes are the building blocks that make a living thing look the way it does. Sykes found those genes were similar to the genes in a polar bear jawbone that was found in the Arctic circle. The jawbone is at least 40,000 years old.

Sykes said Thursday that the tests showed the creatures were not related to modern Himalayan bears. They were direct descendants of the prehistoric animal.

## "Go There And Find One"

It could be a new species, he said. But it could also be a cross between polar bears and brown bears.

"The next thing is go there and find one."

Sykes asked around for samples. One came from an alleged Yeti mummy in India. It was taken by a French mountaineer who was shown the body 40 years ago. Another came from a hair found 10 years ago in Bhutan, 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) to the east.

The distance and dates suggest the species is still alive, Sykes said.  They couldn't have gotten samples from the only two bears left in the Himalayas, he said.

Sykes hasn't published his report. It's being reviewed by other scientists first. But his findings will be part of a TV show Sunday on Britain's Channel 4. They could explain the Yeti legends, said professor Tom Gilbert, of the Natural History Museum of Denmark.

It's easier to believe than something else, said Gilbert. "If he had said it's some kind of new primate, I'd want to see all the data," he said.

## But The Legend Lives On

It probably won't end the myth of the Yeti. It's one of many legends about beasts, such as Sasquatch and Bigfoot. Decades of eyewitness reports, blurry photos and stories have kept the legend alive. But scientists doubt it.

It won't stop yeti believers, said David Frayer, a professor at the University of Kansas. No scientist's data could, he said.

If Sikes wanted to stop the Yeti nonsense, "good luck," he said.

Sykes said he was just using science in a confusing field.

"The Yeti, the Bigfoot, is surrounded in myth and hoaxes," he said. But you can't invent those genes that were found in the hairs, he explained.
