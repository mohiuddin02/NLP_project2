NEW YORK  — What do you get when you mix Thanksgiving with Hanukkah? Thanksgivukkah!

This year U.S. Thanksgiving is happening at the same time as Hanukkah. The rare event has created huge excitement.

The last time it happened was 1888, or at least the last time since Thanksgiving was declared a holiday by President Abraham Lincoln. By one calculation, the next time may be 79,043 years from now.

There's money to be made in Thanksgivukkah. A 9-year-old New York boy created the "menurkey." It's a menorah in the shape of a turkey. A menorah holds candles that are lit during Hanukkah. He's already trademarked the name. That means he owns the rights to use it. He's raised more than $48,000 on Kickstarter, a website where people can give money to projects they like.

## T-Shirts Too, And Songs

T-shirts inspired by the Woodstock festival of 1969 show a turkey on a guitar and read "8 Days of Light, Liberty &amp; Latkes." The creators nabbed the trademark to "Thanksgivukkah."

Songs have popped up celebrating the day. "The Ballad of Thanksgivukkah" has a line saying, "Imagine Judah Maccabee, sitting down to roast turkey and passing the potatoes to Squanto..."

Rabbi David Paskin helped write the song. He also helps run the Kehillah Schechter Academy in Norwood, Mass. He proudly declares his Jewish day school to be the closest to Plymouth Rock. That's thought to be the first place that the Pilgrims landed when coming to America. It has a central place in the Thanksgiving legend.

He says it's amazing that we can have religious and non-religious celebrations at the same time in this country. "There are a lot of places in the world where we would not be able to do that," Paskin said.

The Jewish calendar makes Hanukkah and other religious days appear to drift slightly from year to year. That's different than the U.S., or Gregorian, calendar. But much of the interest over Hanukkah this year is buried in the history of Thanksgiving itself.  Interestingly, Thanksgiving hasn't always been fixed in the same spot. That caused some confusion over Thanksgivukkah.

## Doing The Math

In 1863, Lincoln declared Thanksgiving as the last Thursday in November. The holiday remained there until President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Congress fixed it as the fourth Thursday. That began in 1942.

Jewish practice calls for the first candle of eight-day Hanukkah to be lit the night before Thanksgiving Day this year. So, technically, Thanksgivukkah falls on the "second candle" night.

And then there's Texas. Before 1863, each state decided on its own date for Thanksgiving. As late as 1956, Texans were still chowing down on turkey a week later than everyone else. That's according to a history put together by Chabad.org, a Jewish website. That means Jews in that state might have also been lighting their first Hanukkah candle in 1945 and 1956 at the Thanksgiving table.

There's more early Thanksgiving legends and 2,000 years of tinkering involving the Jewish calendar. But, we'll spare you the trivia.

Jonathan Mizrahi, a scientist at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M., puzzled on the meeting of the two holidays. He did the math showing how often the two holidays have met. And he calculated the chances they may meet again in the future.

## And A Comet To Boot

Last January, he wrote a blog post that generated a lot of buzz on the internet. More than 100,000 people have visited the blog since then, he said. Some visitors questioned his calculations. The interest, Mizrahi said, "has truly blown me away. I've just been totally flabbergasted at the number of responses."

While the whole thing is lots of fun, is there anything bigger happening here?

Well, there's Comet ISON, which is scheduled to pass close by the sun on Thanksgiving this year. It may provide a nice show — possibly even during daylight. Or not, since comets can't always be counted on.

Dana Gitell is a mother of two who lives outside Boston. She partnered with an artist and the Jewish gift site Moderntribe to create and sell souvenir T-shirts, cards and a poster. She sees it as something that happened by chance. But, it's a happy and meaningful occasion. She's donating one-tenth of what she sells to Mazon, a Jewish hunger relief group.

"It's just a day when Jews and the rest of America are celebrating on the same day," she said. "It's an opportunity for us to really celebrate the Jewish American experience, and to give thanks in America for the religious freedom we enjoy here."
