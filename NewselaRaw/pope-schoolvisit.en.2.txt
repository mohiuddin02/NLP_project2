NEW YORK, N.Y. — Pope Francis, the powerful and much-loved leader of the Roman Catholic Church, is coming to New York City later this month. One of the spots he will visit is a rundown block in East Harlem.

The block certainly deserves a blessing more than most places in New York City. Rat poison signs are posted in the soil outside a housing project. Dog droppings dot the sidewalk on one end of the block. Overall the scene is far from the splendor of some of the other places the pope will visit, such as St. Patrick's Cathedral.

Yet Francis has a good reason for coming to the area. On Sept. 25 he will be dropping by Our Lady Queen of Angels School, which sits at the heart of the predominantly Latino and black neighborhood. Most of the school's students are immigrants and come from poor families. They are exactly the kind of people the pope sees as most deserving of assistance. His visit to the school will help draw attention to his fight against poverty and will underline the many struggles immigrants face.

Our Lady Queen of Angels is one of six Catholic elementary schools in Harlem and the South Bronx. Pope Francis sees Catholic schools as essential to his mission of serving the poor, but these days many of those schools are facing extreme challenges.

## Difficult Times For Catholic Schools

New York has lost more than 50 Catholic schools since 2011. They were forced to close because of shifts in population, competition from free private schools, and other factors.

Kathleen Porter-Magee heads the Partnership for Inner-City Education, which manages Our Lady Queen of Angels and five other Catholic schools. She said she hopes the pope's visit "changes the conversation." For too long people have thought the school closings were unavoidable and perhaps not worth fighting over, she said. Recently, many people, both Catholic and non-Catholic, have finally begun to realize that the schools "serve a unique and important need. I believe his visit will help shine a spotlight on them."

Our Lady Queen of Angels has 290 pupils, from prekindergarten to eighth grade, most of whom come from poor families. While visiting the school, the pope will talk with a few students selected by lottery. He will also meet with dozens of refugees and immigrants, including several children who came to the United States on their own, without their parents.

## Excitement, Hope Spread As Visit Nears

Across the street from the school sits the Vianel Beauty Salon. The hairdressers there hope the pope's visit will also draw attention to the loss of Our Lady Queen of Angels Church, which once operated next to the school. The church was closed in 2007, after church leaders decided too many of its members had moved away or died.

Lili Garcia was 17 when she married the love of her life, Junior, in the church 54 years ago. On a recent afternoon, she was missing the church and her husband, who died a year ago.

Garcia held a black-and-white photograph of the wedding couple, she in a puffy white dress, Junior in a rented tuxedo. She clutched it to her chest and wept.

"It is emotional for me," Garcia said of the papal visit to the neighborhood.

She has been getting ready for the visit for weeks. She plans to post Spanish-language newspaper clippings about the pope on the walls and windows of the shop as the day of the visit draws near.

## Party Atmosphere Building In Some Businesses

Vianel Garcia, who runs the beauty salon, and her mother, Amparo Duarte, spoke of the balloons they planned to fly outside the little shop on the big day. They are also planning a party inside the salon for people hoping for a glimpse of the pope.

"I get goose bumps just thinking about it," Duarte said.

Not everyone on the block is caught up in papal excitement, however. Danny Sheeri, who works at a plumbing store a few doors up from the beauty salon, just shrugged when asked about the visit.

"I'm worried about business — why do I care about the pope?" Sheeri said as he puffed on a cigarette.

For Lili Garcia, though, the visit may be just what the neighborhood and its residents need.

## A Pope Of The People

"I like that finally we have a pope who understands the people," she said. She praised Francis for being humble and for helping the church adapt to the times.

"It's a big blessing to have the pope," Garcia said. "We know we're going to have a lot of change. We can feel it."

Duarte said various friends and relatives will be coming to stay with her at her apartment. Their dream is to catch Francis' attention and perhaps draw the famously friendly pope across the street for a blessing and maybe a hug. If he comes over, they plan to offer him a plate of delicious Spanish-style chicken and rice.
