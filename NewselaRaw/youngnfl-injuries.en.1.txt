When is it safe to play tackle football? A new study published Wednesday in the journal Neurology suggests that kids may want to wait until they are at least 12 years old.

Researchers wanted to know if kids who start playing tackle football earlier in life develop differently than kids who start playing later on. To try to find out, they gathered a group of former National Football League (NFL) players and tested their cognitive abilities, such as memory, attention and ability to reason and process information.

The researchers found that the players who had started playing football before age 12 performed an average of 20 percent worse on tests than those who had started after their 12th birthday.

## Pro Players Split Into Two Groups

The study looked at 42 former professional football players between the ages of 41 and 65. They fell into two groups: half started playing tackle football before they were 12, and the other half started when they were 12 or older.

Researchers organized the players for comparison, matching each player with someone in the other group who was a similar age and size. They wanted to make sure that the only significant difference between the players was the age at which they started playing football.

The players were then given a series of cognitive tests. A memory test, for instance, required the players to remember a list of words immediately after it had been read to them, and then again 15 minutes later.

Players were also asked to organize a deck of cards based on various characteristics. This tested their mental flexibility and problem-solving skills. Finally, to gauge their verbal intelligence, researchers asked players to read and pronounce a long list of uncommon words.

On all three tests, the players who had started playing tackle football earlier in life performed significantly worse than their counterparts. The findings suggest that the participants who started playing football before the age of 12 had developed less cognitive ability as a result.

## Brain's Development During Childhood

Bob Stern, a professor of neurology at Boston University School of Medicine, was the lead author of the study. He said that the research team chose the age of 12 as the dividing line because it is an important time for the brain.

"Other research has shown that the brain undergoes key periods of development during childhood," he said. He explained that "several brain structures and functions reach a peak or plateau leading up to the age of 12 in males." In other words, a great deal of brain development takes place in the years before a child's 12th birthday.

The study's findings may be of interest to a lot of young football players and their families. According to researchers Christopher Filley and Charles Bernick, 70 percent of all football players in the U.S. are younger than 14. Players between 9 and 12 are exposed to an average of 240 head impacts in a single football season.

While Filley and Bernick applauded the new study as "innovative," they also noted that it had some major limitations. Studies often try to draw conclusions about the general population by looking at a representative sample group. It is possible, though, that the sample group will be different in one way or another from the general population.

This study only looked at 42 people, a relatively small sample. Maybe this particular group of players was unusual in some way, or the difference in their cognitive abilities was coincidental. Filley and Bernick suggested that a larger study group would have provided more reliable evidence.

## Study Has Limitations

Also, all of the participants in the study were professional athletes. Pros may be different than the average person who plays football as a kid but does not go on to play in the NFL. What is true of professional players may not be true of everyone.

Finally, Filley and Bernick noted that all of the players who participated in the study had been experiencing symptoms of cognitive, behavioral and mood problems in the previous six months. This is another way in which the players may have been different from the general population. Given this difference, the results of the study may not apply to other groups of people.

Stern agreed with the criticism and admitted that the study had limitations.

"Since we only dealt with former NFL players we can't generalize to people who played up to college or high school; we can't generalize to other sports; we can't generalize to girls," he said.

However, if common sense tells parents that it's not a great idea to put a kid at risk of getting a head injury during a time when the brain is doing some important development work, this study seconds that notion, he said. "Common sense may be right," he added.
