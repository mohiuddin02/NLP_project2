He wasn't in the main cabin with the rest of the passengers. Instead, he flew in the wheel well of the plane, the place where the wheels are kept during flight.

He got there by jumping over a fence at San Jose Airport. Now, his adventure is making airports across the nation question how secure they really are.

There have been several break-ins through airport fences across the country in recent years. But none was as unbelievable as the incident Sunday. The California teenager survived a 5½-hour, nonstop flight to Maui, Hawaii.

"If somebody can come onto an airport and get to the wheel well of an airplane, then someone else can plant a bomb," said Brian Jenkins. He works for a group that helps the government with law-making by doing research on things like safety.

## Questions About Security

San Jose's airport is surrounded by 6-foot fences. Some sections have barbed wire on top. At least some of the area where the planes take off is watched by cameras. But airport officials were unaware that anyone got through the fence.

"We have 1,050 acres," Rosemary Barnes said. She is the spokeswoman for the airport. "That's a lot of fence line. He could have scaled the fence line really through any area here at the airport. It's very easy to do so under the cover of darkness, and it appears that's what he did."

Barnes said there is footage of "an unidentified person walking on the airport ramp and approaching" the plane. But that footage was not discovered until after the Hawaiian Airlines Boeing 767 landed in Maui.

"If there is video of him going over the fence, why was there no response?" asked Jenkins. He also directs the National Transportation Security Center at San Jose State.

The U.S. Transportation Security Administration sets the rules for airport safety, but airports are responsible for enforcing them. This can be a little different from airport to airport, with their different geographies and distances from cities. But the break-in has raised questions about security at San Jose.

The embarrassing incident adds to a string of airport break-ins over the past few years. They have stirred concern in Congress.

## Other Incidents

"People shouldn't be able to just access a runway or airliner without getting through pretty tight security," said Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif. He sits on the transportation subcommittee of the House Homeland Security Committee.

The subcommittee is drafting a request that the Government Accountability Office update its 2009 report on airport fence safety needs.

Since that report:

— A driver crashed through a gate onto the runway at Philadelphia airport.

— A jet skier came out of the water and walked across two runways past cameras and motion detectors at JFK International Airport in New York.

— A 16-year-old stowaway got into a Boston-bound airplane's wheel well in Charlotte, N.C. He was killed when the wheel well opened.

— A man dressed as a woman jumped a security fence at Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, N.J. The break-in, although captured on video, wasn't known about for a day, according to reports.

— A drunk 49-year-old man climbed a fence at Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix. He ran across the area where the planes take off.

## Watching Monitors

Some airports use infrared or radar sensing systems. Others rely on video cameras or even guard dogs and police patrols. No matter how complicated the systems, they still depend on individuals watching monitors, experts said. Studies have found the attention span of someone watching a bank of 30 monitors is half an hour at best.

Airport spokeswoman Barnes said Mineta's safety program has many parts. There are "more than 2,800 badge employees," she said. The employees are trained to report safety concerns to law enforcement and airport operations.

But those measures weren't enough to stop a teenager.

Advanced systems are "pricey," noted John Hernandez. He is an aerospace and defense analyst. He is part of a global consulting firm that works with government contractors.

Airports in general don't place high importance on safety around the fences, he said.

Even after the latest incident, "I don't see them spending much money on any enhancements other than the basics," he said. "Maybe some new cameras, some new key cards, better gates, better fences."
