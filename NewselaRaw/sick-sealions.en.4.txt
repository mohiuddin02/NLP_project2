LOS ANGELES â€” Baby sea lions in California are in trouble. Many of the pups are hungry. They are sick and too small. A record number are turning up on beaches.

For the third year, sea lions are in danger.

The pups are not the only ones in danger. Rescuers are finding adult sea lions that are also sick.

## "A Real Shock"

Shawn Johnson works at the Marine Mammal Center. The center is in Sausalito, California. It rescues and cares for sea animals.

In January, his group found 67 sea lions stranded on the beach. Usually, they see just one or two.

"It's a real shock to us," Johnson said.

"It's shaping up to be a very, very bad year," said David Bard. He works at the Marine Mammal Care Center. This rescue center is in Los Angeles. In January, the center cared for 75 sea lions.

## An Emergency

In 2013, the government declared an emergency. There were too many sick and hungry sea lions.

"But then it happened again last year," Johnson said. "Now it's happening again."

Sea lion experts are worried.

What's going on?

Experts have different ideas. Some think the sea lions might be sick. Others think it may be poisons in the ocean. The poisons get into fish. Then the sea lions eat the fish. There also may be too many sea lions and not enough food.

## Not Enough Food?

California sea lions used to be hunted for their fur and a special kind of fat called blubber. The hunting nearly wiped them out. In 1972, the government protected sea lions. Hunting them became against the law. The numbers of sea lions grew, Johnson said. There are now about 300,000 sea lions. About 50,000 baby sea lions are born each year.

There may not be enough food for them all.

"Maybe the fish have all left, and that's why this is happening," Johnson said.

"I hope that we have some answers soon," Johnson said.
