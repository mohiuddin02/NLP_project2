CHICAGO, Ill. â€” Students at a school in Chicago are putting down their cellphones for a few minutes. They're taking a break from technology to look through the paper pages of their school yearbooks.

The pictures we share online are forgotten over time, said Caroline Chengary. She is a senior at Prospect High School. Chengary helps put together the school's yearbook. She likes that the yearbooks last a long time. You can look back at them years later.

Surprisingly, high school students do not really want digital yearbooks. They still want their yearbooks to look like books and not tablets.

## A Book In Your Hands

Hardcover yearbooks are still very popular with students.

It seems a bit unusual. Improvements in technology mean that fewer books are being printed. Now, more books can be read on screens. This is not true for yearbooks.

Kevin Miller works at a company that makes yearbooks. He said that his company tried making digital yearbooks. But the company stopped making them because students wanted hard copies. He said people still want to feel a book in their hands.

## Watching Videos With An App

Still, yearbooks have changed.

Some schools are using technology with their yearbooks. The new technology uses smartphone apps. The yearbook puts links on photos. The smartphone app can then use the links to show videos with the pictures. The videos can be from the prom dance or even an exciting football game.

Technology may change, but books last forever. That is why students want the hard-copy books, experts said.

## "When The Yearbooks Are Handed Out"

Pete Macabobby works at Wheaton Warrenville South High School. He helps students put together their yearbook. Ten students at the school design the yearbook.

The students thought about using videos for their yearbook. But they seemed to just want a traditional yearbook, Macabobby said. He thinks many students feel differently about technology now. He said they do not want to use technology all the time.

New Trier High School has a special event for students in the 12th grade. A jazz band performs while the students write in each other's yearbooks.

Kevin Bond works at New Trier High. He said students still buy as many yearbooks as always. He said the students don't want to just go online to look at their yearbooks.

At Prospect High, Brady Schwartz smiled as he picked up his yearbook. "It's always exciting to see your pictures in the yearbook," he said. "And when the yearbooks are handed out, you know it's that much closer to the end of the school year."
