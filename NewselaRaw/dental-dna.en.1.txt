Clues to what our ancestors ate, how they interacted and what diseases they fought may be found in their teeth, according to a new study.

The information comes from the DNA of millions of tiny organisms embedded in the ancient dental plaque of four medieval skeletons.

"I feel like we discovered a time capsule that has been right under our noses this whole time," said Christina Warinner, the lead author of the study. Warinner is a molecular anthropologist — a scientist who uses DNA information to determine links between groups of humans in different time periods. The study was published in the journal Nature Genetics.

"This is a game changer," she said.

Matthew Collins of the University of York, a co-author of the paper, put it this way, "What we found is a microbial Pompeii."

Pompeii was an ancient Roman city that was preserved nearly intact after it was buried by lava from a volcano eruption in 79 AD.

## Small Fossils In Mouths

Calcified plaque is the rough, bumpy stuff you might notice coating your teeth if you have skipped too many dental appointments. Today, dentists scrape plaque off our teeth as part of our regular dental cleanings. But before the days of modern dental care, it could grow layer upon layer until sometimes the hard plaque covering a tooth was thicker than the tooth itself.

The layers of calcified plaque trap the bacteria that also live in our mouths — turning them into small fossils even when we are alive. And when we die, these dense, calcified micro-fossils remain intact, even as most of the rest of us decomposes.

Throughout most of the history of archaeology, researchers have considered calcified plaque disposable and often removed it from skeletons in the process of cleaning them. But recently, it has become clear that calcified plaque contains a tremendous amount of information.

"People are realizing that you have this rich bacterial community living on the surface of your teeth," Collins said. "There is so much information there. The challenge is how to access it."

Over the last decade scientists had started to look at ancient plaque samples under a microscope, hoping to find microscopic bits of food stuck in its hard material. But Warinner wanted to know whether it had also preserved DNA.

To find out, she scraped the fossilized plaque off the teeth of four skeletons of people who lived 1,000 years ago in a medieval convent in Dalheim, Germany. After treating the samples with various chemicals, she put them through a machine that separates out the DNA.

The result, she said, was thrilling.

## Treasure Trove Of DNA

"When you get DNA from bones it is so damaged and there is so little of it left," she said. "When we analyzed the dental (substance) we got 100 to 1,000 times more DNA fragments than we would have from a bone."

From those DNA fragments, Warinner and an international team of scientists determined that the bacteria associated with human dental disease have not changed much in 1,000 years. The researchers also discovered that ancient oral bacteria had a gene that could allow it to resist low-level antibiotics, just as some of our bacteria has today. And they found bits of plant DNA in the plaque, which provides direct evidence of what people ate in the medieval period.

But these results are just scratching the surface of what scientists can learn from ancient plaque.

Anne Stone, a molecular anthropologist at Arizona State University who was not involved in the study, said the findings were significant.

"What is exciting is it looks like the way (plaque) protects the DNA — almost like it is sealed in concrete — so it is more protected from the environment," she said. Researchers who study germs that cause disease in the respiratory tract will be interested in the study. The study will also be useful to researchers who study how tooth decay and gum diseases have changed over time.

Warinner notes that every known human population has had dental plaque problems. So this technique could be used to learn more about people from a wide range of time periods.

"Everything was there in an incredible level of detail and it was frozen in time," said Collins. "You have so much DNA that you can get complete (sets of DNA) without even trying."
