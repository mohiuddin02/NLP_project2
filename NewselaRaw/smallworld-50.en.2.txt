LOS ANGELES — Alice Davis was working as a seamstress in 1963, sewing ladies underwear in the downtown Los Angeles garment district. One day she got a call: Walt Disney needed her help.

When she got to Disney's office, he told her he was planning a new ride for the 1964 World's Fair in New York. He promised the attraction would bring joy "to every child from 1 to 100."

Disney wanted Davis to design costumes for the ride. She was thrilled. It was a dream come true for a girl who grew up without dolls during the 1930s, when many people in the U.S. were jobless and poor.

"It was marvelous, the joy of my life," she said.

Fifty years later, It's a Small World remains one of Disneyland's most popular attractions.

## A Catchy (Or Annoying) Song

More than 290 million visitors have cruised on its boats. That's about 111,000 a week for half a century.

Go on Small World and you'll be taking a slow-moving and peaceful boat ride through the countries of the world. Each room displays mechanical dolls in traditional costumes dancing and singing the title song over and over again:

"It's a world of laughter / A world of tears / It's a world of hopes / And a world of fears / There's so much that we share / That it's time we're aware / It's a small world after all …"

Small World isn't much different now than it was in 1964. It's still a simple, low-tech attraction with a positive message of peace and understanding. Adding to its popularity: the ride is 15 minutes long, air-conditioned, and the line moves fast.

"It's a Small World," the song, is famously catchy or annoying, depending on your point of view.

Amusement park rides don't usually last this long. Just look at Colossus, a huge wooden roller coaster at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Southern California. It was the world's tallest and fastest wooden coaster when it opened in 1978. Today, Six Flags is preparing to tear it down.

"Ultimately, technology is going to fade," said Phil Hettema, who works in the amusement park business. "What sticks with people is a story."

## "He Wanted Something Special"

The idea for Small World was born more than 50 years ago when the World's Fair came to New York. Walt Disney was asked to build an attraction for UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund.

Disney wanted a ride with a wholesome, inspiring theme, Davis said.

"He wanted something special for little girls," she said.

Disney imagined a boat journey with more than 200 mechanical dolls, dressed in traditional clothes from around the world. The theme song, written by Richard and Robert Sherman, plays an average of 1,200 times a day.

The Sherman Brothers wrote the song as a message of hope after the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. The United States nearly went to war with Russia when it was called the Soviet Union.

Rolly Crump, 84, helped design the ride. He said it is the simple theme and detailed artwork that have kept Small World popular all these years.

"The technology today is burning people out," he said. "This ride is so simple, so clean and nostalgic."

## Through Children's Eyes

Small World opened in 1966 at Disneyland, where it has been steadily popular. It has been copied in Disney parks in Orlando, Tokyo, Paris and Hong Kong.

In 2009, Disney renovated the original ride in Anaheim, California, to add modern Disney songs and movie characters. Now you can see Ariel, Flounder and Nemo in the South Seas section; Woody and Bullseye in North America; and Tinker Bell flying over Tower Bridge in London.

The changes angered some traditionalists but did little to hurt the ride's popularity.

Disneyland art director Kim Irvine, who led the revision work, said she believes Small World allows riders to see the world through the eyes of children.

"It's innocent and pure and tells a story that everyone would love to believe in," she said.

## "It's A Small World" — The Movie

Juanita and Mark Harrigan used to bring their daughter to Small World about 25 years ago. On a recent summer day, they introduced the "fun and relaxing" ride to their 20-month-old granddaughter.

Cindy Oporto has been on Small World about 50 times. Her 2-year-old son, Logan, recently took his first trip on the musical boat journey.

"He likes the singing and the animals," she said.

Fifty years after the ride's birth, it's marking a new milestone: "It's a Small World" — the movie.

Jon Turteltaub, who is directing the movie, first rode Small World in 1966. He recently introduced his own children to it. Small World is innocent and sweet, he said. It provides a rest "from the noise of our society."

He hopes to use computer animation to create "a world of laughter, a world of tears."
