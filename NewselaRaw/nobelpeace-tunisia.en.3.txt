OSLO, Norway â€” A group in Tunisia won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday.

The group is called the Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet. The award is one of the highest honors in the world. The group won the award for leading its country toward democracy and away from war. A democratic government allows people to vote for their leaders and gives their citizens more freedom. Before becoming a democracy, the country was ruled by a leader who had total control and made life difficult for the people.

The Norwegian Nobel Committee said the quartet played an important role as a peacemaker. It encouraged different groups in Tunisia, as well as Tunisian citizens, to sit down peacefully and discuss what kind of government the country should have. The group prevented violence from breaking out.

The prize is a huge victory for small Tunisia in Northern Africa. Its democracy is new and still shaky. The country suffered two extremist attacks this year that killed 60 people. Most of them were tourists. They were killed at a museum or at one of Tunisia's famous beaches.

## Winner Says Prize Shows Others That Peace Works

Mohammed Fadhel Mafoudh is head of the Tunisian Order of Lawyers. It is one of the four groups that make up the quartet. He called the Nobel Peace Prize a message to all groups around the world involved in conflicts.

The prize tells them that everything can be settled by talking it out peacefully, he said. Weapons and war lead people nowhere.

When the prize was announced, Tunisian television and radio stations stopped their programs to excitedly relay the news. Many Tunisians celebrated through social media. Joyful crowds gathered in front of buildings in Tunis, the capital.

In 2011, Tunisian protests started what is called the Arab Spring. The protests throughout the Arab world removed leaders and changed the old way of doing things. Tunisia was the only country, though, that actually built a democracy. The country now has a constitution and a Parliament.

## Official Says Nobel Meant To Encourage Tunisians

Kaci Kullmann Five is the chairwoman of the Nobel committee. She said the prize was meant to encourage the Tunisian people. Five said it also set an example for the other countries that did not become democracies.

She hopes the prize will help protect democracy in Tunisia. It will also give hope to people trying to create peace in the Middle East and North Africa, Five said.

Kullmann Five said the 8 million Swedish kronor prize was for the quartet as a whole. It equals $960,000,

The quartet was formed after the 2013 murder of a politician. His death created a crisis in the country.

Houcine Abassi, the leader of the Tunisian General Labour Union, said he was "overwhelmed" by the award.

He said the prize "crowns" more than two years of the quartet's work during a dangerous time for Tunisia.

## Finding Hope While Continuing To Face Challenges

Abassi said he hopes the award will help "unite Tunisians to face the challenges presenting themselves now." He said the main one was terrorism.

The Peace Prize decision came as a surprise to many. Some people guessed it would go to someone dealing with Europe's migrant crisis. Others thought it would involve the Iran-U.S. deal to prevent Iran from making an atomic bomb.

"It is a very good prize that tries to get into the heart of the conflict in the Muslim world," said Oeyvind Stenersen, a Nobel Prize historian. "It was very unexpected."

Francois Hollande is the president of France. He said he was "happy for all the Tunisians" and added that the prize shows Tunisia's success at becoming a democracy. France used to control Tunisia.

The prize gives support to Tunisia, which has been dealing with terrorist attacks, he said. The day before the prize, a lawmaker was shot at in the Tunisian city of Sousse. An attack in June at a beach in Sousse killed many people, mainly from Great Britain.
