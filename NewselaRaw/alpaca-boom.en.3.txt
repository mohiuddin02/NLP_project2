When police arrived at the ranch, they found 16 dead alpacas, 20 that were dying, and about 175 that were very sick. The animals were starving to death.

These animals were being raised by Robert Silver, 73, and his wife. The couple had hoped to make money raising and breeding alpacas. They ended up losing money and were unable to care for the animals.

Now they both have been charged with animal neglect. In court, they are saying they are not guilty.

Alpacas, related to camels, were first brought to the U.S. from the mountains of Peru. They are valued for their soft and shiny fur.

## At The Large-Animal Hospital

Alpacas can be worth a lot of money. One alpaca farmer, Chris Sturgeon, says he has a male worth $350,000.

The Silvers paid about $6,000 for each of their alpacas, but could only sell them for $1,000.

The 175 sick alpacas are now being cared for at the large-animal hospital at Oregon State University. The veterinarians there have agreed to take care of the alpacas for free. It is also good training for the vet students.

Shari Bond found out about the starving alpacas, called the police, and contacted Oregon State vets for help. She is the co-founder of an alpaca rescue foundation, Cross Creek Alpaca Rescue.

Finding homes for the 175 ill alpacas is the biggest job ever for her group. She is at the animal hospital, deciding which animals are ready to be adopted.

"Look, you can see her backbone," says Bond, pointing to a skinny alpaca.

Even after a month of normal eating, this alpaca is so thin that her spine is showing. In a healthy animal, the spine wouldn't show.

But it's better than in late December, when police were called to rescue the starving animals.

At that time "you could see ribs and hip bones," Bond said.

## Ranch Lost A Lot Of Money

Oregon and Washington are home to many alpacas. Washington state has 20,000 registered alpacas. Oregon has 16,000. In the U.S., only Ohio has more, with 28,000.

Rober Silver says he and his wife got into the alpaca business after she went to a livestock show and fell in love with the cute creatures.

The Silvers, who live in Oregon, spent $320,000 for 50 alpacas, about $6,400 each.

They also had to build a barn, pay for alpaca food, and pay other expenses. They spent a total of $750,000.

"It was our life's savings," Silver says.

"We never were able to sell any," Silver says of baby alpacas.

By last year, they had to sell adult females for only $1,000 each. They were losing a lot of money.

## Heading For New Homes

Now, Silver is warning others that it is not very easy to make money in the alpaca business.

You must be rich already, and really love alpacas, he says.

Today, their alpacas are recovering in the animal hospital at Oregon State, waiting to be adopted.

There are 300 people who want to adopt the alpacas. Today, four have arrived with their trailers.

One of them is 71-year-old Jo Sowards, of Washington.

She and her husband, Glen, retired there and raise racing dogs. They also rescue dogs that need homes.

She takes home four adult female alpacas, one a mom with a baby, and one that is pregnant.

"I'm doing what you call community service. These are dumb animals that needed help," Sowards says.
