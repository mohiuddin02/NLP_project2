CHICAGO — Once up wooden steps, Dr. Fred Richardson Jr. walked into Louise Cannon's house.

He pulled back curtains to a dining room, which had been made up to be almost like a hospital room.

There, the 79-year-old Cannon lay in bed, but when she saw Richardson she beamed a big smile.

Born on Chicago's South Side, Richardson became a doctor in 1990. Since then, he has been grabbing his old, black leather bag and making house calls in the city's most dangerous neighborhoods.

## Helping Other Students In Turn

Richardson also has helped inner-city students struggling with medical school. Three days a week, he helps them with their classwork at no charge.

"He's our brightest light," said John Bradley with the Chicago Area Health and Medical Careers Program. The program helps poor black and Hispanic students through medical school. By Bradley's count, Richardson has saved 50 students from dropping out of medical school, the most of anyone doing that kind of work.

"He's tremendous," Bradley said.

Richardson knew no black doctors when he entered Rush Medical College in Chicago in 1982. His mother was a bookkeeper and his father was a construction worker who struggled with alcoholism. The family lived in a poor area with few jobs and much crime. They moved frequently, and Richardson remembers spending a night in a homeless shelter.

## Mom Pushed For Excellence

There are many reasons why Richardson became a doctor, but it all started with his mother, Gladys Richardson.

"Her goal in life was to educate her children because she thought that was the only way out of Englewood," Richardson said, describing the tough South Side neighborhood where he grew up. His mother was strict and stressed schoolwork and excellence, he said.

Gladys supported the family, somehow earning enough to keep her four kids in Catholic schools. Homework was taken seriously, and straight A's were expected.

That was her way of making sure her children avoided the dangerous path many young people took in Englewood, he said.

Richardson's neighborhood friends "were into all sorts of bad things," but they protected him and his younger brother, Lendell, who also became a doctor. Their friends respected their dream of becoming doctors.

Their attitude was "OK, don't mess with them because they may have to take care of us," Richardson said.

## He Keeps On Going

When he was young, Richardson dreamed of playing shortstop for baseball's Cubs, but he knew that education was his path in life.

In high school, he was one of the best students in his class and earned a scholarship to Loyola University in Chicago. In medical school, he was the only black male in his class.

Medical school was so tough that Richardson had to study 12 hours a day. To get through it, Richardson said he relied on the example his mother set — and still does.

As a doctor, Richardson works six days a week. His patients can call him 24 hours a day, seven days a week. He says he sleeps four hours a night and does not drink alcohol or coffee.

What keeps him going is the effect he has on people's lives.

On the same night he made a house call to Louise Cannon, he visited the home of 95-year-old Alberta Bowles, who lives alone.

He asked about her shortness of breath and gently massaged her hands, asking her if they hurt.

"One of the things I enjoy the most about having a doctor like Dr. Fred is that he's a good listener," Bowles said. "He is the son I didn't have."

## Next Generation Of Doctors

After he finishes making house calls, he helps medical students study to be doctors.

Twenty years ago, Clyde Whiting was one of those students.

Without Richardson's help, he might not have finished medical school. "I could have been lost," he said.

Today, Whiting is an emergency room doctor and Richardson is his own personal doctor.

At Louise Cannon's house, Richardson checked her blood pressure and hearing. After that, he let her 2-year-old great-great-granddaughter listen to her own heartbeat with his stethoscope.

"There you go," Richardson said. "You could be a doctor someday."
