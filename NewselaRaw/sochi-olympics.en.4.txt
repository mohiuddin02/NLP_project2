LONDON â€” People all over the world get excited about the Olympics.

But the next Olympics is having trouble selling tickets. It's Russia's first Winter Olympics. It will take place in the city of Sochi from February 7-23.

Less than three weeks before the Sochi Games start, hundreds of thousands of tickets still haven't been sold. There could be empty seats. It could also mean less excitement.

Many fans from other countries are staying away for several reasons. Some are worried about terrorism. Also, flying there costs a lot of money. There's not much else to do in Sochi. And getting permission to enter Russia is hard.

## Last-Minute Sales Expected

Gerhard Heiberg is a member of the International Olympic Committee from Norway. The committee runs the Olympics. He said some people in Norway are afraid to go. "Of course, there will be Norwegians there but not as many as we are used to."

Sochi organizers said seven of every 10 tickets for sale have been sold.

The chief of the Russian group organizing the Olympics is Dmitry Chernyshenko. He said about 213,000 fans are expected. About three-fourths are likely to be Russians.

"Tickets are being snapped up fast," the Russian group organizing the Olympics said in a statement. It said a lot of people will buy tickets at the last minute. Organizers aren't worried about empty seats.

But other Olympics sold most of their tickets. Almost all were sold for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. And almost all were also sold for the 2012 Summer Games in London.

## Tickets From $15 To $1,200

Heiberg helped organize the 1994 Lillehammer Winter Olympics in Norway. He said the Russians have cut down by half the number of viewers for the mountain events. The reason was worry about safety.

That means there will be less people than in Lillehammer, he said. And probably less excitement. The Lillehammer games stood out for being colorful. A lot of it was because the Norwegian fans were so excited.

Sochi's ticket sales began in February 2013. Tickets have been sold first-come, first-served on Sochi's website. Ticket offices are now open in Sochi and Moscow, Russia's capital.

The cheapest tickets go for about $15. The ones that cost the most are $1,200. More than half of all tickets cost less than $150. That's expensive since the average Russian makes $890 each month.

The only ticket office in Sochi was busy one afternoon. A lot of people were lined up. Many complained that all the cheap tickets were already gone.

"What can you can do?" said Yana Ivolovskaya. She lives in Sochi. She bought two tickets for the bobsled event for $60. "We're not going to get another Olympics in Sochi so I thought I should go."

## Flights To Moscow, Then Sochi

Attracting visitors from other countries has been hard. Terrorism is a big worry. Two bombings killed 34 people last month in Volgograd. It's only about 400 miles from Sochi. An Islamic group in Russia claimed responsibility, and threatened to strike the Sochi Games.

It also costs a lot of money to fly to Sochi. Most travelers from around the world have to fly first to Moscow. Then they have to get another plane to Sochi.

For travelers from the West, getting permission to enter Russia takes time. They also have to get a special pass to watch the games.

Jan Serenander helps run a company in Norway that sells tickets to the Olympics. He mentioned another reason. "When Sochi was announced, no one had even heard of the place," said Serenander. He said they had to get out their maps to find it.

Die-hard winter fans will not be discouraged. You can't miss speedskating fans from the Netherlands at any Winter Games. They are all dressed in orange. It's the national color of the Netherlands.

"I expect it to be orange," Jeroen de Roever, said of the place where Sochi's speedskating will be held. He's the head of a ticket seller in the Netherlands. "We have been sold out for quite a while."
