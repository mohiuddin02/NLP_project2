FLORENCE, S.C. — One afternoon last week, Jeb Bush's black SUV pulled up to Wholly Smokin' barbecue joint. Bush is running for president and the crowd was excited to see him. Bush is 6-feet, 4-inches tall, and his head poked above a bunch of television cameras.

"What we need is quiet, strong leadership," Bush told about 150 people in the room. He shook hands and posed for dozens of cellphone pictures. Everyone running for president is known as a candidate. The race for president is not about a candidate's personality, Bush said. "It's about a servant leader who fixes the big things."

The former Florida governor had picked the right state to make his case.

## Primaries Tend To Winnow Outsiders

It might seem to the Republican leaders that voters are going crazy. Many of them are supporting two outsider candidates — Donald Trump and Ben Carson. Both of them say rather extreme things. Yet to win the vote in South Carolina, a candidate has to appeal to many different groups in the Republican Party.

Before a Republican candidate can get to the general election, he or she has to compete in elections called primaries. There are two sets of primary elections, one for the Democrats and one for the Republicans. The winners from each political party run against each other in the general election in November.

The first state in the South to hold a primary election, South Carolina has had an almost perfect record. Since 1980, it has correctly picked the Republican candidate every election year except 2012.

## One State, Many Types Of Republicans

In South Carolina, there are different kinds of Republicans, and different issues are important to them. There are many conservative Republicans. In general, conservatives support old-fashioned values and traditional ways of doing things. Yet, some South Carolina Republicans mainly want the government to be careful about money. Meanwhile, there are others who are hunters and fishermen and want to preserve nature. 

Finally, the military has major bases in the state, and 400,000 veterans have settled there after their military service ended. Many of them are interested in a strong military.

State Republican Chairman Matt Moore said South Carolina Republicans are practical. They want to know whether a candidate can win the general election. "They want to elect a president," he said.

## Rubio Looks Presidential, But He's Young

Ken Wezl was waiting in the restaurant to hear from Bush. He thinks Bush would be "a good president."

He also likes Florida Senator Marco Rubio, another Republican candidate. Wezl said people support Rubio because he is able to explain his message well and because they like how he looks. "You can picture him up there against the Democrats," said Wezl, who is a retired owner of a construction company. Rubio looks like a president. Yet Rubio, who is 43, is in his first term as senator and might not have enough experience to be president, Wezl said.

Wezl's wife, Karen, wants to vote for Jeb Bush, but she isn't completely sure.

## Checking Out Kasich

In Spartanburg, Ron Pockette was at the Beacon Drive-In checking out Ohio Governor John Kasich. He likes that Kasich is blunt. Pockette also admires that Kasich worked toward a balanced budget when he was a member of the House of Representatives in the 1990s. A balanced budget is when the government does not spend more than it takes in through taxes.

"He has lots of experience in Washington and in running a state, and he sounds strong, like he'll push his ideas forward," said Pockette, a retired nurse and Navy veteran. "He has a proven track record."

He won't vote for Trump, although he said the billionaire businessman keeps him entertained. "I like to hear him go off, but the guy can't carry the load," Pockette said.

## Trump Leads In The State

Right now, Trump is leading in South Carolina and about one out of four Republican voters support him, according to surveys in the state. Carson is running second, with about one out of five Republican voters. About one of out of 10 support Rubio, and even fewer say they will vote for Bush.

Jim Drury was at a Trump campaign event in Spartanburg last week. "We do need to make America great again," said Drury, a retired firefighter from Union, South Carolina.

"We are losing everything, we're losing the war on terrorism, we're losing our jobs," he said.
