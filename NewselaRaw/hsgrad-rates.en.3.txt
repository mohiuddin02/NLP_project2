WASHINGTON, D.C. — Students who finish high school receive a diploma. The diploma proves they have finished all their courses. They then can go on to college or start looking for a job. 

Finishing high school is known as graduating. 

Not all students graduate, though. Some never finish high school. Instead, they drop out. 

Many people worry that far too many U.S. high school students do not graduate.

The U.S. government keeps track of how many students graduate from high school. The overall number of graduates is not the important number, though. It could go up just because the number of students went up. 

The important thing to ask is how many students out every 100 students graduate. The answer to that question is known as the graduation rate.

## First, The Good News

The U.S. government recently released its latest report on high school graduation. The report gives the figures for the 2013-2014 school year. 

The news is both good and bad. 

The good news is that the graduation rate rose slightly. In the 2013-2014 school year, 82 out of every 100 students finished high school. The year before, only 81 out of every 100 students graduated. 

Also, the graduation rates of white and nonwhite students are closer than before. African-American and Hispanic students still have lower graduation rates. However, the difference has gotten smaller. 

Eighty-seven out of every 100 white students finished high school in 2013-2014. 

During the same period, around 72 out of every 100 African-American students graduated. Seventy-six out of every 100 Hispanic students graduated. Both African-American and Hispanic students have higher graduation rates than they did before.

## And Then The Bad News

There is bad news, however. The graduation rate did not rise as much as it did in the past three school years. Also, only some types of students did better than other types.

Many people are worried that too many students are still not graduating. Students are dropping out of high school without getting a degree. Not having a degree makes it much harder for them to find a good job.

The latest figures show big differences from state to state. Some parts of the country have much higher graduation rates than others. 

Iowa did the best of all the states. Around 91 out of every 100 high school students there graduated. Washington, D.C., had the lowest rate. Only 61 out of every 100 students graduated.

Nebraska, New Jersey, Wisconsin, Texas, New Hampshire and Indiana were close behind Iowa. All were in the high 80s. Nevada and New Mexico were down at the bottom of the list. They were in the 60s, just ahead of Washington, D.C.

## Groups Still Concerned About Graduation Rate

The country's overall graduation rate did go up. However, the rate also went up the past three school years. In 2013-2014 it did not go up as much as it did during those earlier years.

Many people feel the graduation rate is still much too low. Almost 1 out of every 5 students is not graduating. They will find it hard to get good-paying jobs.

Several groups are now pushing for a new goal. They want to see 90 out of every 100 students graduating by 2020. 

Going from 81 out of every 100 students graduating to 82 is certainly good news, these groups say. However, the change is not big or fast enough. The U.S. must do better, they say.

Still, African-American and Hispanic students are graduating more than before. The national graduation rate has gone up. Those are reasons to be happy.
