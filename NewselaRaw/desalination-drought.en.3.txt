CARLSBAD, Calif. — Along this patch of the Pacific Ocean, construction crews are busy. Many people will be watching the huge building they are putting up. It may soon help solve problems caused by California's terrible drought.

The new building is known as the Carlsbad Desalination Project. It will be used for something called desalination. The process of desalination uses machinery to remove salt from ocean water to make it drinkable. Each day, 56 million gallons of Pacific Ocean seawater will be turned into drinking water for San Diego County.

Right now, the county needs drinkable water badly. It has to rely on water that is shipped in from elsewhere. Desalination is very expensive, but at least people in the area can count on it as a way to get the water they need. After all, the Pacific Ocean is right there, and it is huge.

"It's drought-proof, that's one of the most important" things, said water-use expert Bob Yamada.

## Tiny Ocean Life To Consider

Not everyone thinks desalination is a good idea, though. It is very expensive, because it takes so much electricity. It also can cause problems for fish and other ocean life.

Desalination should be the last choice to fix drought, said environmentalist Conner Everts. "There's a lot of challenges to it."

Desalination involves two main stages: taking in seawater and then sending leftover water back into the ocean.

Desalination plants operate by drawing in seawater. Unless the way it takes in water is carefully designed, it can harm ocean life.

One approach is to use fish screens. Just as window screens are made so that air can pass through but insects cannot, fish screens allow in water, but keep most fish out. The problem is, they don't keep out the smallest fish. They also do not keep out the many forms of ocean life that are much smaller, like fish eggs. Such tiny lifeforms may seem unimportant, but these organisms make up most of the life in the ocean. Fish depend on them for food.

Everything that passes through fish screens will be sucked into the desalination plant. At that point, it will be killed.

## Leftover Water Is Even Saltier

The second problem with desalination is discharge water. It is water that is released back into the ocean. Desalination typically uses two times more seawater than it produces in fresh water. To make 50 million gallons of fresh water, Carlsbad will need to draw in 100 million gallons of seawater. The leftover water will be returned to the ocean. However, it will not go back the way it came in: It will be much saltier. Normally, returned ocean water is twice as salty as when it was pulled in.

Discharge water is usually so salty that it does not mix well in the ocean.

"It's like oil and vinegar — they stay separate," water expert Victoria Whitney said. "You end up with these very large dead zones … where you have really salty water just sitting on the ocean bottom."

Carlsbad has plans to deal with this problem. Before the super-salty water is returned to the ocean, it will be mixed with unsalted water that is not drinkable. The discharge water will then be only about one-fifth saltier than ocean water usually is.

Not everyone agrees with desalination. Other cities in California are trying different ways of fixing California's water problem, including trying to recycle water or catch more rainwater.
