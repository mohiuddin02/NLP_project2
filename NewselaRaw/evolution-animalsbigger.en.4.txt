Scientists say they have proved that bigger is better. At least when it comes to evolution.

Evolution is an idea, or theory, about how life has developed over the years.

A theory called Cope's Rule said that animals start out small. Then they get bigger over a long period of time. Scientists have argued about Cope's Rule for years. Scientists Jonathan Payne and Noah Heim say that they have proved the rule is true.

Payne and Heim work at Stanford University. They studied records about the remains of things that lived hundreds of millions of years ago. Scientists call these the fossil record. A fossil can be an old bone, or a shell, or even an imprint of an animal on a rock.

## 17,000 Types Of Fossils

They looked at animal growth over the past 542 million years. Payne and Heim studied animals that live in the water, called marine animals. They say marine animals have gotten 150 times larger.

The scallop is an example. Scallops from millions of years ago were much smaller than they are today. Back then, they were only about one-quarter inch long. Another example of Cope's Rule is the horse. Horses started out the size of dogs.

The Stanford team took a tough look at Cope's Rule. They measured more than 17,000 groups of marine fossils. High school students and Stanford students helped with the work.

Students carefully measured pictures of fossils. Then the measurements were studied using computers. The scientists found that the rule was correct.

## Predicting Evolution

They also found out that evolution can be predicted. This finding was even more important.

Take an animal called the sea urchin. Two million years ago, sea urchins were only about two inches long. Now they can be nearly a foot long, said Heim.

Animals don't just get bigger from parent to child. Instead, bigger animals take over from the smaller ones, the scientists found. Then the bigger ones mate together.

Also, the animals didn't get a little bit bigger at a time. Their size got bigger at certain times. The urchin's first big jump in size started more than 500 million years ago. Then they stopped growing in size from 250 to 65 million years ago. Urchins then had another jump in size around 60 million years ago.

## What's The Big Deal?

These growth spurts may happen when a lot of animals die out. These are called mass extinctions. They make room for new creatures, Heim said.

The scientists didn't study why being big is so important. Maybe it's harder for anything else to eat them. Or they could be better at fighting off other animals.

Does this mean Earth will be full of giants someday?

No. Size eventually becomes a problem, Heim said. Breathing becomes difficult. Lungs need to be huge and work very well to keep supplying air to animals with large bodies. Food is a challenge, too. There just isn't enough of it.

There is one other thing. Humans can change the rules. Hunters and fishers want large animals. That means smaller animals have a better chance to live, said Heim.
