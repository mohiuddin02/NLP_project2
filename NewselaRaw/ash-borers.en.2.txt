The emerald ash borer, a tiny, glitter-green insect from China, is expected to kill nearly all ash trees in the eastern United States, unless they are treated with expensive chemicals. Now, there is more disturbing news: The borer may have found a new target.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed that the borer had attacked the white fringe tree, which is in the same family as not only the ash, but forsythia and lilac.

Experts don't know quite what to make of the find yet, other than that it is worrisome.

Tom Tiddens supervises plant health care at the Chicago Botanic Garden. The finding, he said, "is bringing up more questions than answers."

The Botanic Garden has 42 "beautiful" fringe trees of its own to worry about.

## Will It Snack Or Enjoy A Feast?

Will the half-inch insect be a major fringe tree pest, or a minor one? Will it kill fringe trees, as it does ashes, or just damage them?

Maybe the insect was merely taste-testing a close relative of the ash because, by now, so few ash trees are left alive in Ohio. That's where the discovery was made by a college science professor on a walk. He passed a fringe tree and decided to examine it — bingo! There the bugs were.

Perhaps the bugs were sampling a fringe tree only because they could not find any ashes. "If the buffet is crowded at the prime-rib station," Tiddens said, "the meat loaf station may get some visits."

A much scarier explanation is that the insect is adapting. It could be developing the ability to live off of other kinds of trees besides the ash.

## Looking For The Next Meal

Researchers, Tiddens said, have wondered for years what would happen after the borer swept through an area, killing all but a few ash trees. "It makes sense they would begin feeding on other stuff in the same family."

It completed its life cycle on the tree. Adults laid eggs, which hatched into larvae, which turned into pupae and then re-emerged through D-shaped holes as adults.

Officials in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, which are experiencing just the early stages of the borer's attack, are on the alert, but not yet alarmed. The fringe tree is not common in either state, fortunately.

New Jersey bug expert Paul Kurtz said he is not too worried at this point. He said he knew of just a few small pockets of fringe trees in the southern part of the state.

"I can say with confidence, this will not really affect the forest diversity in New Jersey," he said.

Forsythias or lilacs, he said, would not be likely targets because they do not have the quantity of bark that the insect needs to survive. Neither "has enough meat on the bones, so to speak," Kurtz said.

What the Ohio discovery has done, he said, is to make people reconsider the borer, which scientists previously believed was only interested in ashes. Only research and time will tell if the insect has changed its diet.

## They Arrived Hungry

Likewise, Don Eggen, a Pennsylvania bug expert, said that in his state the unwelcome development is "early on." Rather than being a crisis, he said, it is "something more to keep a lookout for."

The emerald ash borer — one of many borers that attack trees — has been chomping its way south and east from Detroit, where it was discovered in 2002. It is believed to have entered the Detroit port on wooden packing crates.

The borer lays its eggs on the bark of ashes. Eventually, the larvae girdle the tree, cutting the flow of needed chemicals and minerals and killing it. For local authorities and homeowners, taking down dead or dying trees, which can cause damage or injury if they fall, has been a huge expense.
