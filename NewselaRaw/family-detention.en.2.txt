SAN ANTONIO, Texas â€” Mothers with children are being released more quickly from Texas centers where immigrants are being held after crossing into the U.S. illegally. Far more are being given ankle-monitoring bracelets instead of paying bonds, according to immigration attorneys. The change came after the nation's top immigration official announced a new policy.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is the government agency in charge of enforcing immigration laws. An ICE spokesman would not confirm that more people were being released. He did say ICE would usually not hold mothers with children who reasonably think they will face trouble from the government in their home countries. To get released, these mothers still have to provide an address in the United States where they will stay. They also cannot be a national security risk or somebody who might run away.

"This is a decision they should have made a long time ago," said Jonathan Ryan. He is director of RAICES, the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services. The group offers legal help to detainees.

## More Families Need A Place To Stay

Ryan said his volunteers have seen more women and children at the downtown San Antonio bus station who have been released from two South Texas facilities where immigrants are held. The volunteers also noticed an increase in the number of families needing a place to stay overnight.

"We've seen ICE start to implement additional strategies for releasing people," added Brian Hoffman. He is leading a volunteer lawyers project for the American Immigration Lawyers Association and other groups at the nation's largest family detention center in Dilley. The Dilley center is about 70 miles southwest of San Antonio.

"But there are people who have been here longer than a month," he said.

## Asylum Seekers Want To Live In The U.S.

ICE opened two large detention centers south of San Antonio after tens of thousands of migrant families crossed the Rio Grande last summer. Most of the families were from Central America. Detention centers are places where the families are held until a decision is made about whether they can stay in the United States. However, amid political pressure and a lawsuit, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson announced in June that families seeking asylum would only have to stay in the centers for a short time. Families seeking asylum want to live in the U.S. because they are afraid the government in their home countries will persecute them, or treat them badly.

Johnson promised substantial changes. These included "reasonable and realistic" bonds and quick release for families with believable asylum claims. A bond is money that a person pays to be set free until their case can be decided.

Among the recently released immigrants was Juliana Tecu. She said she fled Guatemala with her 9-year-old daughter after her ex-husband threatened to kill her. During an interview, she said she spent 17 days at the 2,400-bed holding facility in Dilley after illegally crossing into the U.S. in late June.

She was granted a $4,000 bond. Her son in Los Angeles was able to pay the bond with help from friends and relatives.

"If I waited up to a month, maybe they would lower it," she said in Spanish, referring to the bond. "But when? I didn't want to be there."

## Use Of Ankle Bracelets On The Rise

About a half dozen other mothers with their children at the bus station were wearing ankle bracelets. Their jeans barely concealed the chunky technology. The ankle bracelets allow authorities to keep track of people who wear them.

Ryan said there's been a significant jump in the number of mothers being given ankle-monitoring bracelets. However, he and other immigrant supporters say the devices are given out inconsistently.

Linda Brandmiller is an immigration lawyer. She has represented several women held at the 500-bed immigrant holding facility in Karnes City. Brandmiller said ankle-monitoring bracelets are a fair alternative in some cases. Still, she said there should be sound rules for using them.

"Everybody shouldn't need an ankle bracelet," she said. Not everyone will run away, she said.

ICE said it uses ankle bracelets and other alternatives to detention on a case-by-case basis.

## Centers Will Remain Open

ICE reported the Karnes City facility was housing 122 people as of Tuesday. The Dilley facility was housing about 2,000. A third family holding facility is in Pennsylvania and is much smaller.

The agency said the number of women and children at the facilities is expected to drop in the coming weeks. Still, the centers will remain open to process new immigrants who have crossed illegally into the United States. They will also be used to hold people who don't meet the standards to ask for asylum.

RAICES reported that in the week after Johnson's announcement, nearly 70 women and children were released from the Karnes City facility. Ryan said that is an increase from previous weeks. He said his organization expects about 30 families to be released each day in the coming weeks.

"ICE and the administration have known all along that family detention doesn't work," he said.
