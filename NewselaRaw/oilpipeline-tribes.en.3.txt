WASHINGTON — Faith Spotted Eagle figures that building a crude oil pipeline near tribal lands would bring little to Indian Country besides more crime and dirty water. But, she doubts that [Native Americans](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=native+american) will get the U.S. government to block the project.

"There is no way for Native people to say no — there never has been," said Spotted Eagle, 65, a Yankton Sioux tribal elder from Lake Andes, S.D. She says her people's history of losing their lands doesn't make her hopeful that the project will be stopped.

South Dakota is home to some of the nation's poorest American Indians. And there's a lot of money behind the huge pipeline project. It would be a 1,700-mile pipe stretching from Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast.

Opponents may be down after a government study released on Jan. 31. It found that the proposed Keystone XL pipeline would not contribute to [global warming](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming). The study said that the warming of the earth caused by burning oil wouldn't increase because of the pipeline.

## Pollution Worries Vs. Money

Tribes are busy preparing for nonviolent battle with TransCanada — the company that plans to develop the pipeline.

Organizers said they want to keep their exact plans a secret. But, they want to block the movement of construction equipment and the delivery of materials.

"We're going to do everything we possibly can," said Greg Grey Cloud of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe. Tribes may set up camps nearby to follow the construction. He stressed that any actions would be peaceful. "We're not going to damage anything," he said.

Like much of the country, however, tribal members are divided over the pipeline. In South Dakota, some fear the effects of pollution. Yet others want the money and jobs the pipeline project will bring.

In Winner, S.D., Mayor Jess Keesis is eager to welcome construction workers. If President Barack Obama approves the pipeline, a 600-member "man camp" would open just 10 miles from this town of 3,000 people.

"We deal with drought and 8-foot blizzards and all kinds of stuff," said Keesis. Besides being mayor, he's also a member of the Potawatomi Nation. "So anytime we can get something like this to give us a shot, it's a good thing."

## Barack Black Eagle's Promise

Opponents say the risks are too great.

Two weeks ago, a group of Native American tribes approved a statement saying that they stand ready to protect their "sacred water."

Tribes also want to protect Native women. They fear that Native women would become easy prey for thousands of construction workers living in work camps. The government says that one of every three Indian women are assaulted during their lifetimes. Most attacks are by non-Native men.

Opponents said they don't want to have to follow through on their plans. They hope that they have sway with a president who just happens to be an adopted Indian. That would be Barack Black Eagle. The president was formally adopted by members of Montana's Crow Indian Tribe in 2008, when he visited the tribal reservation.

Grey Cloud said Obama has promised to "not allow pollution in our area."

Keesis said the project carries risks but would work out in the long run. His city of Winner stands to get a windfall of money. Construction workers would be spending money at the town's restaurants, bars and movie theater.

After spending 20 years working in oilfields and nearby towns, he's says much has changed. Construction workers are forced to behave now.

## Pipeline Close To Their Lands

Obama has not said when he'll make a final decision. But, he is under heavy pressure to approve the project. Just last week, 45 senators sent a letter to the president, saying thousands of jobs are at stake. They reminded him that he had promised to make a decision by the end of 2013.

In South Dakota, the proposed line would not go through any of the state's nine reservations. But, tribes say it's close enough to still be risky.

The argument for building the pipeline is a hard sell in South Dakota, where history is still raw. It's the scene of the some of the bloodiest battles between Indians and the federal government. In 1890, U.S. troops killed nearly 300 Sioux at Wounded Knee Creek.

Spotted Eagle said she feels obliged to try to stop the pipeline. She wants to keep her land and water clean for her grandchildren and to protect women from attacks.

She said that "bringing in these man camps" is a reminder of "when they put us in forts and they wanted our land."
