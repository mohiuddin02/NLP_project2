When people get caught for being cruel to their animals, they get sent to jail. In the meantime, what happens to the animals they own? For years, the criminal justice system in Chicago, Illinois, failed to properly handle animals whose owners were involved in court cases.

Mostly dogs, the animals were victims of abuse or neglect. They were seized when their owners were arrested. The cases moved slowly through the courts and the animals would remain locked up as evidence, sometimes for years. When the cases were finally settled, the common outcome was to euthanize them, or put the dogs to sleep.

Animal rights supporters in Chicago were angry because they thought this was unfair. "The dogs did the time but not the crime" is one of their favorite mottos. So they developed a plan to save the animals.

## More Dogs Are Being Rescued

In 2010, a group called Safe Humane Chicago launched the Court Case Dogs program. They worked with Animal Care and Control and received money and workers from Best Friends Animal Society, and with help from those groups, got the animals out of cages, rehabilitated and into homes.

The approach was the first of its kind in the nation. It is now fully run by Safe Humane, a group that encourages positive relationships between people and animals.

When the program was started, only 2 out of 10 of the jailed dogs got out alive, or 20 percent. Today, that number is 7 out of 10, and 760 dogs have gone through the program.

They have had to work hard to get convince people that the dogs are more than just evidence, says Cynthia Bathurst. She is the president of Safe Humane Chicago. "These are the dogs everyone should care about."

## The Animals Had Hard Lives

The stories of these dogs and the people who are saving their lives is being told in a new photography book by Susan Russell called "A Ruff Road Home: The Court Case Dogs of Chicago." The book shows more than 20 dogs that had been brutalized or neglected, and shows them in their new homes, safe and loved. It is available online for $40 at the Safe Humane Chicago website.

"Some of the dogs were fought," says Russell, a writer, lawyer and shelter volunteer in Chicago. "Some of the dogs were dumped in trash cans. Some of the dogs belonged to hoarders. Some were beaten mercilessly. Every one of these dogs had a terrible start." Yet this shows the toughness of the dogs and the kindness of people, he said.

The hefty 105-page book features remarkable images by photographer Josh Feeney. He is a master at capturing dogs' personalities and worked for free on the book.

Likewise, editors, the book designer and Safe Humane volunteers and partners worked for free on the three-year project. The finished book is beautiful and moving, and every penny from sales goes directly to Safe Humane Chicago.

## Every Dog Has A Story

At the heart of "Ruff Road" are the stories of the dogs.

There's Bruno, the first dog in the program, who spent more than a year in a kennel after being taken away from an abusive owner who was kicking him down the street. Bruno now is the loving pet of a family outside Chicago city. There is Dolly, who was imprisoned in a basement before being found by Chicago police. She has now earned her AKC Canine Good Citizen certificate under the tutoring of Steve Lackey. He is a former prisoner who has become a famous dog trainer. Then there's Derek Jeter, also known as DJ. DJ is a terrier mix who had been abused on videos that were posted online for entertainment. He too, has found a couple to love him.

Then there are the people who work in the program. Bathurst oversees Safe Humane's operation, and runs it along with experts in dog training and behavior. They are helped by an army of volunteers. The families who adopt the animals are also special.

The dogs are strong, but the people show how it can be done, Russell says.
