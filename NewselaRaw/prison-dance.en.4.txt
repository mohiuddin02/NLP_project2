MIAMI â€” Ernest Williams stopped asking his family to come see him in prison. The visits made him sad because he could not see them more often.

Recently, Williams traded his prison uniform for a suit and tie. He danced with his three daughters. He had not seen them in months.

Williams and his girls attended the first-ever Daddy-Daughter Dance in the government prison system. The theme was There's Still Time at the Ball. It reminded prisoners that they still have time to become better fathers.

## Making Families Stronger

"I was so happy to see them but so sad that I will not be able to leave with them," said Williams. He is spending 41 months in a Miami prison for selling drugs. "I am here instead of being outside with my family because of the choices I made."

The Daddy-Daughter Dance reaches out to families of prisoners. The goal is to help prisoners do well when they get out of jail. Strong families help keep ex-prisoners from breaking the law again.

The prison system plans to hold dances at other prisons around the country.

Charles E. Samuels Jr. leads the Federal Bureau of Prisons. "You are a key to the success of your father," he told the 20 girls. They were 4 to 18 years old.

Some of the girls were so young, they only knew their father in prison. Others were old enough to remember when their father was home.

## Dancing, Hugging, Laughing

"I haven't been there for so many special moments," said prisoner Michael Rangel. His eyes began tearing up. Rangel has three daughters. He has been in prison almost three years for theft. "I talk to them and email them all the time, but it's not the same as being there."

The dance was held in a meeting room transformed into a fairy-tale ballroom. It was decorated with purple ribbons, glitter paper, and a big cardboard carriage.

One by one, each man greeted his daughter to the song "You Are So Beautiful."

The 13 fathers and their daughters danced and hugged, laughed and cried.

"I wanted to dress up to look pretty for my daddy," said Rangel's 15-year-old daughter. Her 13-year-old sister said, "I wanted to make him feel special."

## A Better Future

Still, no one could forget that the dance was held in prison.

Each of the girls walked through metal doors. They had to remove their shoes, jewelry and belts to go through a scanner.

Walter T. Richardson is with the Miami-Dade Police Department. He hoped the dance would change the prisoners. "We want the focus not so much on what happened, what brought them here, but what kind of future they can have. Their daughters are their future."

## "She Misses Me"

After the dance, Anthony Martin sat quietly. One of his two daughters was crying, head in her hands.

"She misses me and I love her so much," he said, comforting the 8-year-old. "I was so glad to be able to interact with my girls in a different way."

Martin is in prison for 70 months for selling drugs.

"I missed my youngest daughter learning to talk. I missed the 'terrible twos.' I missed the first day of school," he said. "And then something like this happens where you see them all dressed up and looking so pretty. It just makes you want to do the right thing."
