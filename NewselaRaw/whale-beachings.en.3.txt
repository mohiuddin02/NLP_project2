This is almost three times as many as would normally be expected.

The sharp rise in strandings has left scientists baffled. They are now beginning to wonder: Could there be a single, deadly explanation?

"We're all starting to pay close attention to what might be going on," said Florida state government scientist Denise Boyd. Scientists are hoping to "see if there are any links or if they're unrelated."

One theory is that the whales might have come down with morbillivirus. This illness has been attacking dolphins along the East Coast this year. But examinations of dead whales have failed to turn up the disease.

The series of cold fronts that marched across Florida in the past month could be part of the problem. "Any kind of front or a hurricane disorients the animals," said ocean scientist Erin Fougeres. And when that happens, "they come in."

## Two Mass Strandings

Sonar waves sent out by Navy ships to locate objects underwater can cause whales to aim toward shore. But that explanation has been ruled out, Fougeres said. The Navy wasn't conducting any sonar exercises when the whales stranded.

Or, the whales could have been following a sick leader, Boyd said. Sick whales often head toward shallow waters to make breathing easier. Whales have to surface to breath.

But nothing so far is certain, Fougeres said. And "there are cases where we just never know the cause."

On average, about 200 whales each year land on Florida's shores. About one "mass stranding," involving at least several whales, occurs every three years in the state.

Yet in just the past two months, a total of 93 whales came ashore in Florida. And most of those, 91, were involved in two mass strandings.

On Dec. 4, 43 pilot whales got caught in the shallows of Everglades National Park on the state's southwestern coast. Nine died. Four days later, 11 pilot whales, part of the same pod, beached near Key West. All of those whales died.

From Jan. 19–22, 12 pilot whales beached themselves between Naples and Fort Myers. Eight died or were put to sleep. On Jan. 23, 25 more whales, most believed to be part of the same pod, were found dead on Kice Island.

"Mass strandings aren't necessarily rare," Fougeres said. "But to have two so close together is."

At the same time, on Jan. 2, a dead sperm whale was found floating near Key Largo. And on Jan. 10, a sperm whale weighing up to 15 tons was found dead in Boca Raton.

## Well-Meaning Bystanders

Florida sees more stranded whales than any other state, followed by California. Beachings also have been reported in large numbers along the northern Gulf Coast. Before the latest cases, the most recent strandings in Florida were in 2012, 2011 and 2003.

Pilot and sperm whales are commonly found 1,000 to 2,000 feet down in the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico. There they feast on squid, octopus, crab, shrimp and other fish.

Pilot whales are typically 18 to 20 feet long and weigh up to two tons. Normally, they live in tropical and cooler waters.

Sperm whales are considerably larger. Up to 60 feet and 40 tons, they are roughly the size of a school bus. Females remain in tropical or subtropical waters year-round. Males migrate north to find cooler waters, then return south to breed.

Various other kinds of whales also can be found near Florida. These include: pygmy sperm whales, humpback whales, North Atlantic right whales, Bryde's whales and gervais beaked whales.

Government scientists point to one problem they face during rescue tries: Well-meaning bystanders who attempt to push the large whales back into the sea.

"We always ask people not to push the animals back out, because they generally strand for a reason," Boyd said. "These people are well-intentioned, but that can do more harm than good."
