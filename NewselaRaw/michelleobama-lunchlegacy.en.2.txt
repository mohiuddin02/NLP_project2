WASHINGTON, D.C. — First lady Michelle Obama has spent years trying to make school lunches healthier, but she has faced resistance from Republicans. Now, even though they do not always agree, Republicans and Democrats have compromised. U.S. Congress members came up with a deal that preserves much of what the first lady wants. It also loosens some rules in ways that benefit major food companies.

The agreement is part of a five-year bill, or proposed law. It covers $30 billion annually for school nutrition and related programs. The bill eased rules about whole grains and sodium, or salt. It also preserves fruit and vegetable standards and keeps junk food off menus. Both sides claimed victory, urging Congress to pass the rare bipartisan deal and move on. The Senate Agriculture Committee is voting on the 200-page plan Wednesday.

## First Lady's Nutrition Policy

"School nutrition policy can't thrive with just part of the country behind it," said Parke Wilde. He is a nutrition policy professor at Tufts University in Boston. "Even if some of the compromises were painful, it seems hugely beneficial for the kids involved to have bipartisan legislation moving forward. This still is better off than where we started."

The agreement keeps most of a nutrition policy that the first lady has fought for. Stricter rules that she supported took effect with the last child nutrition legislation in 2010. Since then, huge food companies such as Pepsico Inc. and General Mills have spent millions of dollars trying to influence the latest bill. 

Republicans have fought the regulations. They claim the federal government is doing too much to control school lunches. They also say the program costs schools too much money and discourages children from eating the meals. The School Nutrition Association is a group of food service professionals that tries to influence the government on money for school food programs. The group sided with Republicans.  

## Working Out A Deal

Senator Pat Roberts is the Republican chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Senator Debbie Stabenow is the committee's top Democrat. The two senators negotiated the agreement. It lowers the amount of whole grains that need to be in grain products from 100 percent to 80 percent. It also eases restrictions on sodium. Under the 2010 law, the amount of sodium allowed in meals was to be cut in half. The new bill says schools can take a little longer to reduce the amount of salt in their food. 

Both changes make it easier for food companies to sell schools inexpensive food. They also meet nutrition standards.

Other rules were preserved, including a mandate that schools serve a half-cup of fruit and vegetables with each meal. Reimbursement for meals served in summer school-feeding programs was expanded. This was a top goal of the Obama administration.

## "Step In The Right Direction"

The White House has approved the agreement, according to Agriculture Committee staff. The first lady's office referred questions to the White House. An official there said that while the administration was still reviewing the bill, it shares the goals that Senators Roberts and Stabenow have set out. The official was not authorized to speak on the record.

In a statement, the nutrition association praised the agreement. "(It) eases operational challenges and provides school meal programs critical flexibility to help them plan healthy school meals that appeal to students." 

The deal was also cheered by Food Policy Action, a group that promotes healthy eating and was founded by "Top Chef" head Tom Colicchio. It said the deal was "a huge step in the right direction" that "protects the progress we made on nutrition standards in 2010." 

## The Fight Against Obesity

Michelle Obama has actively sought ways to combat obesity. The condition now affects more than one-third of American adults and 17 percent of children, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Her Let's Move! program is geared toward making kids more physically active. Meanwhile, her nutrition guidelines show her involvement in policy that affects things like the school lunch program. The U.S. Department of Agriculture says more than 31 million children each school day take advantage of the program, which offers nutritionally balanced, low-cost or free lunches. 

The full Senate may take up the bill as soon as next month.
