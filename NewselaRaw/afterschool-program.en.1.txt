OROSI, Calif. —  Emilio Isazaga says he hopes his education will get himself and his family "out of the struggle" to lead better lives.

The 17-year-old takes part in an after-school program called Tech Connect in Orosi. The yearlong program teaches students how to repair computers, prepare taxes and perform community service. 

For many, the class is a chance at a brighter future. Every high school senior in Tech Connect has gone on to attend college. It's a great accomplishment, especially considering that 62 percent of adults in Orosi and nearby Cutler don't graduate from high school, compared to 32 percent throughout Tulare County, according to a 2013 survey. 

## Equal Opportunities For The Poor

After he was inspired by a similar program in San Francisco, Miguel Castañeda started Tech Connect in 2009. Castañeda grew up in an agricultural city called Delano, California. He thought students who were raised in poorer rural areas should receive the same opportunities as those raised in wealthier areas.

"It's hard out here," he says of Cutler-Orosi, adding that many people work as farm laborers for very little money and there are lots of gangs.

There are regularly more than 100 high school students in the Cutler-Orosi Joint Unified School District who apply for 30 slots in his Tech Connect class. Castañeda doesn't choose participants based on grade-point average. He looks for students with a passion, and a need, for learning.

Emilio is one of those young people. "Honestly," Emilio says, "I've been through some things, you know? I'm trying to learn some things."

## A Father Figure

Emilio's mother was forced to leave the United States because she had come to the country illegally. After she was deported to Mexico, Emilio and his younger sister moved in with his grandmother. Emilio broke the law and is currently under tight supervision. Despite his troubles, Emilio managed to graduate from high school two years early at age 16.

One of the reasons Emilio loves Tech Connect is because Castañeda has become a father figure.

Emilio sat in his classroom last week. Outside sirens could be heard screaming in the distance, surely an omen of someone in trouble.  

Emilio says Tech Connect enables him to channel his energy in positive ways. "Right now, it's helping me stay out of those sirens, right? It will help me build some character, help out my people, you know? I feel like it's a good choice, to help out."

## Doing What It Takes To Help Others

Tech Connect students are required to do community service. They clean up graffiti around town, feed the homeless and teach adults how to use computers. Starting again next month, students will volunteer doing taxes for low-income Orsi residents on Saturdays. Each year, all of Castaneda's students have become certified in tax preparation.

Castaneda also takes students on field trips to colleges, offers tutoring and helps connect them with jobs in the community. One of his students is Adylene Saucedo, 15, who says Castañeda is a great leader and "will do whatever he can to help you out."

Tech Connect is a California Services Employment Training (CSET) program that is also funded by the Cutler-Orosi Joint Unified School District and the Central Valley Community Foundation. Castañeda is also a senior program specialist for CSET.

"He's just really good at what he does," says Elizabeth Gonzalez. A grant writer who applies for government funds to help pay for the program, she watched Castañeda teach students about computer parts last week.

"This subject could be really boring, but as you can see, the kids are really engaged," Gonzales said. "He's just very giving, very giving."

## Being A Role Model

Emilio agrees that Castañeda is a role model. "Mr. Miguel, he's really nice to us, you know? So I think that's good for a teacher."

Emilio's classmates have a similar perspective.

"My family is so unstable right now," says Sara Rabadan, 17. "He doesn't give up on people. He literally told us, a couple of times, he's not going to give up – even if we put up the struggles. I think that's nice 'cuz there are parents that give up on you, ya know."

"He teaches us to help your community, help other people," says Christian Salacup, 15, "and by doing that, now it gives us at least a little bit of a habit to help others.

"He said in one of our first meetings that he had a rough past, bad people around him," Salacup  added. "Even though he went through all of that, he was still able to find a way to help others and himself succeed."

## Doing Some Good ... For A Change

Emilio says he will likely attend a community college before transferring to a four-year college "if they want me." He's still deciding what he'd like to study, but he's sure the skills he's learned through Tech Connect will help him.

"Hopefully I get to get out of my struggle too, ya know, and will learn a little something along the way. And do some good for a change, right?"
