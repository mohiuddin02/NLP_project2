WASHINGTON â€” The Supreme Court is the highest court in the land. On Monday, it voted in favor of religious freedom. The court told companies that they cannot refuse to hire someone because of his or her religion. Companies must allow different religious practices in the workplace, the court said.

Workers cannot be treated unfairly and unequally because of their religion, the court declared. Unequal and unfair treatment is known as discrimination.

Many religions haves rules about how people should dress. Companies also often have rules about how people should dress at work. Sometimes the two sets of rules do not match up. On Monday, the court declared that companies must be willing to make changes to their rules in order to allow people to follow their religion. Such changes are known as accommodations.

The court was considering the case of Samantha Elauf, a Muslim girl. When she was 17 years old, Elauf was turned down for a job at Abercrombie &amp; Fitch because she wears a headscarf. The girl accused the clothing store of discriminating against her. She claimed it did not hire her simply because she is Muslim.

On Monday, the Supreme Court ruled in her favor. The vote was 8 to 1.

## Store's Bosses Said Scarf Did Not Look Right

In 2008, Elauf tried to get a job at an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch store in Oklahoma. When she went in to talk to the bosses there, she wore a black headscarf. Many Muslim women wear such scarves every day for religious reasons. For many Muslims, it is not proper for a woman's hair to be uncovered in public. Elauf was turned away because the store's bosses thought her scarf did not fit in with the company's look.

In court, the clothing company said it wanted all its workers to have a certain "look." After all, it is a clothing store. The look it wants simply does not include wearing a headscarf.

The company also said Elauf did not mention her religion. It said it did not discriminate against her because of her religion, since it did not know she was Muslim.

The company's claim was rejected in the courtroom Monday. Justice Antonin Scalia said it was simply not believable. The store must have known or "at least suspected" that Elauf wore the headscarf for religious reasons, he said.

The court ruled that it did not matter whether or not Elauf mentioned her religion. What counted was that the company must have known. It simply wanted to avoid making any accommodations.

Experts in workplace discrimination said the decision could have a big effect.

From now on, workers and job seekers will not have to ask for a "religious accommodation," said lawyer Michael Droke. It will be up to companies to make accommodations whether they are asked or not.

The court's decision was welcomed by many religious groups.

## Company Has Changed Its Dress Code

Abercrombie &amp; Fitch was not happy about it, however.

Carlene Benz works for the company. She denied it had discriminated against Elauf. She said the company lets workers wear headscarves when they ask to be allowed to do so for religious reasons.

Benz also said the chain has a new dress code. Workers now have more choice in what they wear.

The Supreme Court's decision on Monday was based on the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The act says businesses may not "refuse to hire" someone because of their "race, color, religion, sex or national origin."

Courts have rarely used the act to protect people against religious discrimination. The law is better known for banning discrimination based on race.

On Monday, Justice Clarence Thomas was the only judge to vote in favor of Abercrombie &amp; Fitch.

Thomas said the company's dress rules covered all workers equally. Wanting a particular person to follow those rules is not discrimination, he argued.
