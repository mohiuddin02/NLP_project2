REHOVOT, Israel — Israeli schools opened their gates Monday as 2 million children returned to school in a welcome sign of normality after the Gaza war.

But despite balloons and cheerful signs, this was not a typical first day of school.

Though the return to school is always something of a national holiday in Israel, emotions were mixed this year. Pupils, parents and educators were relieved to get back to their routines although they were still sorting through the heartbreak of a summer of war.

## Students Are Easing Back Into Routines

A week ago, a cease-fire ended the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic group that rules the neighboring Gaza Strip. The war claimed the lives of 72 people on the Israeli side, most of them soldiers. The Gaza Strip is reeling from a far larger loss of more than 2,000 lives, mostly civilians, according to international agencies.

In Israel, regular studies were suspended for the beginning of the school year and security remained a concern, although the cease-fire appeared to be holding. Adding to the sense of unease was the fact that school funding was cut 2 percent to help pay for the war. In Gaza, it will be weeks before the school year can begin. At least 220 schools were damaged or destroyed and many still serve as shelters for Palestinian families who lost their homes in the war. In the meantime, half a million Gaza students will be out of school.

In Israel, rather than hitting the books immediately, students will be eased back with two weeks of discussions about their personal experiences during the war. Schools will also take part in "relaxing activities, facilitating emotional expression," the Education Ministry said. Special, if low-key, attention was given Monday to pupils whose families lost loved ones in the fighting.

## Children Ask Probing Questions

Politicians flocked to schools to welcome students, especially in the southern parts of Israel that were hardest hit by rocket fire.

Schoolchildren in the town of Netivot peppered Communications Minister Gilad Erdan with tough questions: What would happen if Israel were to topple Hamas? Why does Israel provide electricity to Gaza?

"These are questions of political science university students, not children returning from summer vacation," Erdan told Israeli news media.

At age 5, kindergartner Daniel Neardea of Rishon LeZion recognizes the different sounds of incoming rockets and Iron Dome interceptors. Iron Dome is Israel's air defense system that shot down rockets fired from Gaza. Daniel can also identify Israel's army chief of staff and the top Hamas political leaders.

Describing the summer as "loud," his mother, Enav Neardea, said her children mostly took the rockets and sirens in stride, even when they were out at the playground or swimming pool and had to immediately find a bomb shelter. "I guess they understand this is part of their lives now," she said over the counter of her cafe in the town of Rehovot. She said she was relieved to have them back in school.

## Education Suffers A Funding Blow

Looming over the return to school Monday was the financial cost of the war. The Israeli Cabinet decided Sunday on a 2 percent across-the-board cut for all government ministries — except defense.

With the second-highest annual budget after defense, the Education Ministry stands to lose about $140 million. This will give a big boost to the defense budget, as well as urgent assistance to the communities closest to the border with Gaza.

Education Minister Shay Piron insisted Monday that the move would not harm core education programs, teaching hours or important programs. He added that the cuts were coming from additional funding the ministry had been expecting.

Still, many parents argue that the Israeli government does not spend enough money on public education. Per-pupil, Israel spends well below international averages for developed countries, as measured by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Parents are forced to dig into their pockets for extra spending for their children's schools.

"We will feel the impact directly," said Sophie Hod. The policewoman and mother of two said parents had been notified that school payments would go up. "I suppose there's not much choice," Hod added, noting that tourism, business and most other economic areas were suffering.

"There's always some urgent need that puts off reforms," she said. "Everything takes second place to security, but that's how it must be here for now."

## A Financial Balancing Act

In a series of interviews over the weekend, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged the challenge of balancing defense needs while maintaining a strong economy and good government services. However, he said, "security must come first."

As unpopular as tax increases are, some politicians criticized the budget cut. They said that the citizens who need government services most will be the ones to suffer and that a temporary tax would be a fairer way to offset war costs.

Environment Minister Amir Peretz, who voted against the cut, said it would hit poorer Israelis "directly in the pocket." Peretz said that it is true that the government promised not to create new taxes. However, it should acknowledge that an unexpected event had taken place — the war — and "have enough courage to impose a temporary tax that would spread the burden more equally."
