FRESNO, Calif. — Picture the award-winning photo taken by Time magazine's Instagram Photographer of the Year. What flashes through your mind? A perfectly timed picture of a Super Bowl-winning touchdown? A surprising photo that gives a glimpse of what your favorite stars' lives are like behind the scenes? How about a hard-earned shot taken from the eye of a dangerous storm or the middle of a war?

Matt Black pictures something entirely different. Black, who won Time's 2014 Instagram award, prefers to photograph California's Central Valley farmworkers. He captures the stories behind their sunburned faces and physically demanding lives.

## Drought, Dust And Human Suffering

Richard Steven Street is a well-known photographer, journalist and historian. He describes Black's work as "the highest form of photography." Street points out that it would be much easier for Black to snap random pictures of Kim Kardashian. He says they would sell like crazy, too.

Street praises Black for using his talents on what some find boring or sad. He says it is far more important than other popular topics.

Black's photographs provide an in-depth look at large-scale agriculture: the expensive tractors, the huge yields of vegetables, the once-dry land transformed into a giant food-making machine. He also photographs drought: the cracked earth, the dust, the human suffering. Black also photographs migrations of farmworkers as the they travel from their homes in other countries, like Mexico, to the farms where they work in California.

## Creating The Images

Black has pursued his own persistent, patient brand of journalism for more than 25 years. But Black's project choices are not what sets him apart from other photographers. The way he creates such gritty images is also quite different.

Black does not jump from one assignment to the next — the issues he is tackling are just too important for that.

It takes Black months, sometimes years, to really get to know a story. He spends a long time building the trust that allows him to get images that few photographers have the patience to catch.

During California's last big drought, Black rented an apartment close to farmworkers for three months just to be near to his project. He got a feel for what it was like to to be a part of the community there. He got pictures that out-of-town photographers cannot get by "parachuting" into a story for a few days.

## Photography Is Storytelling

Black's appreciation for the storytelling power of photography began in high school. He worked weekends at the local paper, where he got hooked on black-and-white photography.

One day in 1988, he volunteered to cover Cesar Chavez, a leader of farmworkers who was breaking a 36-day hunger strike to protest poor safety conditions on farms. Black went on his own to shoot the pictures and, reluctantly, his editor ended up deciding to print them in the newspaper. Black says it showed him what photography can do. "Because I went on my own, the story got published," he said. "It was based on nothing more than the fact that I did it."

Black came back to the central San Joaquin Valley after college because it was home to the type of photography he wanted to do. He did not want a steady job at a magazine or newspaper. He took freelance jobs so he could pick and choose the projects he wanted. They did not pay as much money, but he got to do work that mattered to him.

His wife, Melissa Martell Black, had similar goals. She wanted to focus on her writing, which involves social themes like those found in her husband's work. She taught classes at a community college to keep money coming in each month.

Without his wife's support, Black says he would never be where he is today.

## Quiet Man Has A Lot To Say

Black had an especially good year in 2014. The New Yorker magazine published eight pages of his California drought photos. Then his "From Clouds to Dust" exhibit was featured at an elite art gallery in New York City.

Black also received support from MSNBC.com to expand his "Geography of Poverty" project with a three-month road trip across the country. He wants to let people know that the Central Valley is not the only area with economic and environmental struggles.

As his fame grows, Black remains humble. He did not shout and celebrate when he won the Time magazine award. As his wife explains, that is not his way. He is by nature a quieter man, but he is still thankful for all the attention because it means his work — and the issues it explores — will be seen by more people than ever before.

"I've devoted myself to these images," Black says. "That's the one voice I have. I've got a lot I want to say."
