Tesla Motors makes the Model S electric car. It already claims its car can go the longest distance without being plugged in to recharge its betteries. Now it also says the S stands for safest car on the road.

Tesla said the car had the best score ever on government safety tests. People inside the car were the least likely to be hurt during a crash.

The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration didn't say if Tesla was right. But the Model S did get a five-star safety rating. Only vehicles that do the best on the crash tests get that rating.

The NHTSA is a government agency. It sets vehicle safety standards and makes sure they are followed.

## A Safety Star Is Born

Tesla said the NHTSA does not release scores above five-stars to the public. But car makers get an overall score. The score that goes to the car companies can show a rating above five, Tesla said.

The Model S got 5.4 stars, Tesla said. That was a new record, the company said. The NHTSA didn't return phone calls for comment on whether that was the case.

Cars powered by gasoline typically have a big engine in front. The Model S does not. That helps make the car safer, Tesla said.

The front of the Model S has "a much longer crumple" zone, Tesla said. The crumple zone is designed to be smashed. It can absorb some of the energy in a crash. A longer crumple zone helps prevent injuries to the riders inside a car, Tesla said.

## Won't Roll Over

Tesla also tucks its large, heavy battery pack below the floor of the car. That helped in another test. It kept the car from rolling over, Tesla said. "The Model S refused to turn over" with the normal testing methods, the car company said.

The Model S is getting good reviews from others too. Consumer Reports said it was one of the best cars the magazine has ever tested. A lot of people pay attention to what the magazine says.

Tesla wants to become the first successful brand new U.S. auto company in nearly 100 years. Tesla started selling the Model S about a year ago.

A Model S costs $63,570. But the price jumps to well above $100,000 if a customer buys a larger battery. The bigger battery lets you drive the car more than 200 miles on one charge. Other electric cars can't make it half that far.

## Making More Money

The automaker made money for the first time at the beginning of the year. Tesla also made more money in the second three months of the year. Analysts on Wall Street predict how well companies will do. Tesla made more money than they had expected.

Tesla gets special tax rewards every time it sells a car. The rewards are called credits. The credits help the company make money. It has sold about $150 million of these credits to other automakers so far this year.

Tesla expects to sell about 20,000 Model S cars this year.

Tesla builds the Model S at a factory in California. It plans to also make an electric SUV there. It will be built on the same platform as the Model S and share much of its technology. It plans to start building the SUV next year.
