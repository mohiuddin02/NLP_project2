BAGHDAD â€” Earlier this month, members of the Islamic State group entered Mosul's Central Library. The mission was to destroy books containing ideas they do not like.

The Islamic State group has been fighting government forces in both Iraq and neighboring Syria. It is also known as ISIS or ISIL. So far, it has managed to take over one-third of Iraq. It has also seized a third of Syria.

The group wants to make Iraq into a country that is controlled by its brand of Islam. It aims to rid society of everything that does not fit its religious vision. It has destroyed many old things, including ancient buildings. Now, it is going after books.

## Smash And Burn

The men smashed the locks that had protected the library, which is the largest in the Iraqi city of Mosul. Then they loaded about 2,000 books into six pickup trucks. The books included children's stories and books on sports, health and science. Only Islamic books were left behind.

The books attack God and "call for disobeying Allah," an Islamic State official declared during the raid. "So they will be burned." The books were stuffed into empty flour bags and taken away.

It is not yet known what has happened to the Central Library's materials that were removed. However, most people think the old books, newspapers and maps have probably been destroyed.

Islamic State members struck again only days after their attack on the Central Library. The new target was the University of Mosul's library. They gathered up hundreds of books and burned them in front of horrified students.

## Different Century, Same Hate

A University of Mosul history professor said that Islamic State members had started attacking libraries last month. He reported that three libraries were especially damaged: a Sunni Muslim library, the library of a 265-year-old church, and the Mosul Museum Library. The museum library contained works dating back to 5000 BC.

Hakim al-Zamili is an Iraqi lawmaker. He said the Islamic State group is just like the raiding Mongols who attacked Baghdad in 1258. Back then, the Mongols dumped many ancient books into the Tigris River. It is said that the waters turned black from running ink.

"The only difference is that the Mongols threw the books in the Tigris River," while the Islamic State group "is burning them," al-Zamili said. The way of thinking is just the same, he said.
