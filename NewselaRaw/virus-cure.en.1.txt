In the spring of 2012, Emma Whitehead was close to death. She was just 6 years old and suffering from leukemia, a form of cancer.

After she was diagnosed in 2010, Emma's parents, Kari and Tom, originally tried a traditional cancer treatment - chemotherapy  - to cure their daughter. But after each chemotherapy treatment, Emma's cancer reappeared.

Desperate to save their only child, Kari and Tom decided to enroll Emma in an experimental treatment at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in April 2012. The treatment involved collecting and removing millions of Emma's T-cells - a type of white blood cell that is a vital part of the body's immune system. Those T-cells were then infected with a disabled form of the virus that causes AIDS. The virus is called HIV.

## Serial Killer Cells

"The virus has been engineered so it can't cause disease anymore," Dr. Carl June of the University of Pennsylvania said in the short film "Fire With Fire". "But it still retains the ability to reprogram the immune system so that it will now attack cancer cells."

The altered T-cells are injected into the patient's veins. If all goes according to plan, they will multiply.

"We call the modified immune (T) cells, serial killer cells," June tells Ross Kauffman. Kauffman directed the film about Emma's treatment. "Each infused cell can kill more than 1,000 different tumor cells," June explained.

The experimental procedure made Emma very ill. She was placed on a ventilator to help her breathe. Her body temperature reached 105 degrees. Swollen and unconscious, Emma's family prepared for her death.

"Emma had breathing difficulties and blood pressure difficulties," Dr. Stephan Grupp of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia told Kauffman. "We knew that she could not have gotten any sicker without actually dying."

But Emma did not die. The modified T-cells that had been injected into her body began to grow and started to fight the cancer in her system. On May 2, her 7th birthday, Emma woke up feeling better. Her fever had dropped and she was able to breathe on her own again. She was also cancer-free.

"It was like the calm after the storm," June said in the film. "The clouds went away and she woke up and there was no leukemia. When that child survived it was an amazing event."

## Treatment Does Not Work For All

Emma was the first child to receive the experimental treatment. However, she was not the first patient in the advanced stages of leukemia to try the procedure. Adults have also tried to cure their cancer with the disabled HIV procedure.

The New York Times reported that three adult leukemia patients treated at the University of Pennsylvania were also found to be cancer-free after the treatment.

However, six other adults and one other child who received the treatment still have leukemia.

"The reality is the dramatic responses of cancer to new treatments are very unusual," Grupp told Kauffman.  "We need to make it clear when we talk to a family that (this treatment) may not work."

According to The New York Times, "the research is still in its early stages, and many questions remain. The researchers are not entirely sure why the treatment works, or why it sometimes fails."

The modified T-cells not only destroy cancer cells, they also destroy some healthy cells. This means patients are at risk of becoming sick from infection.

Even though it has had mixed results and may cause side effects, there is a lot of interest in the treatment. Novartis, a global drugmaker, gave University of Pennsylvania researchers $20 million. The money will pay for more studies of the drug. They hope to eventually offer it to more patients.

## A Cheaper Cure

The new virus treatment could replace a difficult and expensive treatment. Normally, when other options are exhausted, the majority of leukemia patients try a bone-marrow transplant. Bone marrow is the soft, spongy, fatty tissue inside your bones. A bone-marrow transplant replaces damaged or destroyed bone marrow with healthy bone-marrow stem cells. The transplant is hard on the patient. Its results are uncertain. It is also a very expensive procedure.

Although using altered T-cells requires a tailor-made drug, it is much cheaper than having a bone-marrow transplant.

While the price is an important aspect of this experimental treatment, researchers and leukemia patients alike would like to find a cure for the disease - no matter what the cost.

Just ask Emma's parents. Last year their daughter was deathly ill and today she is completely cancer-free and leading a healthy life. Emma will enter third grade this fall.
