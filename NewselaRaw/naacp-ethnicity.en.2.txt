SEATTLE, Wash. â€” Rachel Dolezal has created a national conversation around some of the most difficult issues in American life today. People are talking about what it means to identify with a certain race, gender or culture. However, the civil rights activist probably did not dream of this becoming her teachable moment.

Dolezal, who is 37, resigned Monday as president of the Spokane, Washington, chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). The civil rights organization works to stop racial discrimination, particularly for African Americans. Dolezal gave up her position after it was revealed that she is a white woman posing as black. Her situation was confirmed last week by her white parents, who live in Montana and have not seen their daughter in years.

Dolezal's case highlights Americans' conflicting feelings about the country's increasingly multicultural population and the race people identify with. The quick, loud response to her startling situation swirls around the issue of white privilege and the adoption of a different cultural identity.

## National Controversy Surrounds Case

This much is known for sure: An ambitious activist in a midsized city unleashed a storm of anger and sympathy last Thursday. The debate spread coast to coast and shows no sign of resting. On Monday, Dolezal sent a letter of resignation to the NAACP's national headquarters and posted a lengthy explanation on the Spokane chapter's Facebook page.

She spoke about the fight that lies ahead to move "the cause of human rights and the Black Liberation Movement along the continuum ... and into a future of self-determination and empowerment." She did not address the claims that she lied about her race. She did not apologize for the controversy.

Baz Dreisinger is the author of "Near Black: White-to-Black Passing in American Culture." Many people have liberal and flexible ideas about race, she said. Still, "they're really stuck in a very black-is-black and white-is-white ideology. When a scenario like this comes around to upend those categories, it's a shocker."

## Work In Washington State Earned Praise

Dolezal has been praised for revitalizing Spokane's chapter of the 106-year-old civil rights organization. But according to court documents obtained Monday by the Los Angeles Times, when she was a graduate student in art at Howard University, she sued the historically black school in Washington, D.C. Dolezal claimed that she was a victim of racial discrimination.

She said that university officials removed some of her artwork from a student exhibit in 2001 because it favored African-American students over her, according to a court summary of her arguments.

Her claims were dismissed by the courts. A spokeswoman for Howard University declined to comment because the matter was resolved.

Dolezal recently walked away from a TV reporter who confronted her about her race. The reporter from KXLY in Spokane showed Dolezal a photograph of an elderly black man whose picture was on the Spokane NAACP's Facebook page and asked whether it was her father. "Yes, that's my dad," she replied. Then, when asked whether she is African-American, Dolezal replied, "I don't understand the question," and walked away.

## Mom Suggests "Advantage In Her Activism"

Dolezal's mother and father have adopted three African-American children and one Haitian child. They say she has passed as black even though she was born to white parents.

"She may have felt that she had some advantage in her activism by being portrayed as a black woman," her mother, Ruthanne Dolezal, said on NBC's "Today" show Monday morning. "We hope that Rachel will get the help she needs to deal with her identity issues."

"We taught our children, as we raised all six of them, tell the truth, always be honest. So we weren't going to lie; we told the truth: Rachel is our birth daughter," her father, Lawrence Dolezal, said on the show.

## NAACP Leader Sees "Disappointment And Pain"

The NAACP national president, Cornell William Brooks, spoke in an interview on Monday with the Times. The former chapter leader was widely liked and respected in Spokane, he said. There is "a great deal of disappointment and pain now."

Brooks also insisted that "racial identity is not a qualifying or disqualifying characteristic for leadership or membership within the NAACP."

What is important is the organization's "credibility in terms of truth-telling," Brooks said.

When asked about the fact that Dolezal lied about her identity, Brooks said, "No. Lying is not consistent with our values."

Ed Prince is the executive director of the Washington State Commission on African American Affairs. He said the outrage over the Dolezal case "goes to the heart of white privilege. An African-American can never wake up and say, 'I'm gonna make my hair blond, put on white makeup and go through my day as a white person.'"
