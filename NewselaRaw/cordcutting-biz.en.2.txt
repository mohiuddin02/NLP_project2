SAN DIEGO, Calif. — On weekdays in the Larsen household, Kirsten, 12, and Soren, 15, get up early and park themselves on the couch before school. They do not turn on the TV, though. Instead, the youngsters each pull out their cellphones and watch YouTube to get a dose of videos. This is the way they acquire the information they need to know before encountering peers.

These are the young people who will be leaving cable TV behind in the future. Not only is cable becoming increasingly unnecessary to them, but so, too, is the actual TV set.

In fact, the changing of TV viewing habits is most evidenced in how tots, tweens and teens consume content. They use phones and tablets to watch the video-streaming apps of their liking. YouTube and Netflix are the standouts.

"The shift away from traditional broadcast cable TV services, that has been happening for years," but now it has become a really big deal, said Terence Burke of KidSay, a company that does research on kids' habits. "Kids still watch TV. They still head to Disney and Nickelodeon." They just do not do it for as long, he said.

## Small-Screen Takeover

Burke spends much of his time in elementary, middle and high schools studying the habits of kids. He believes there is a massive movement underway, with kids shifting away from cable TV. The future is about videos being watched on handheld devices, he believes.

Smarty Pants is a company that conducts an annual study on the digital behavior of children ages 6 to 12. It found that 81 percent of 6- to 8-year-olds use YouTube, as well as 76 percent of 9- to 12-year-olds.

Netflix, meanwhile, is used by more than three-quarters of the older group. A large chunk of the 6- to 8-year-olds are also Netflix users, according to the company's, "2015 Clicks, Taps & Swipes Report."

There is an endless selection of videos that are funny and even educational on YouTube. The website is not only the new stand-in for traditional cable TV for kids. It is the way they search for video. As kids get older, Netflix satisfies tweens' growing interest in shows that have a continuing story. Tweens are typically 11 to 12 years old.

## Always Something On

YouTube and Netflix win with kids because there is always something to watch.

To attract kids and, more importantly their parents, YouTube, Netflix and even Amazon have all created special spaces just for kids. Those family friendly zones do well with preschoolers and kindergartners. Older kids want the real thing, though.

Kids should be 13 to watch regular YouTube, Burke said, but even 8-year-olds watch it. "How are you going to keep them on YouTube Kids when they've seen YouTube? You're not." 

That, in part, explains the existence of YouTube Red. It is a new $10-per-month subscription service that removes all ads, allows for offline viewing, lets users watch clips while they are using other apps, and will eventually come with original programming and movies featuring YouTube stars. YouTube has already successfully hooked kids while they are young, so why not create a way for them to pay for more of what they clearly love?

In fact, YouTube ranks as the most-used smartphone app for boys and girls ages 8 to 11, according to KidSay. It is also their favorite app and top website.

## Videos Appeal To All Ages

Boys' favorite YouTube channels include "JackSepticEye," "PewDiePie" and "Stampylonghead." They sound more like ridiculous, cartoon characters than big entertainment brands. Yet, these channels make up an important group on YouTube, one that has made video-game commentators and comedians famous.

Young girls have slightly different tastes, but still pick Internet video. KidSay's survey found that 33 percent of tween-age girls picked streaming services like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon as their first choice for watching shows.

YouTube is, of course, still very much a winner with young girls.

Susan Polizzotto's daughters Rachel, 9, and Lauren, 11, watch a variety of YouTube channels using their own iPad mini tablets. The kids watch Stampy's Minecraft videos. They also check out clips on how to paint nails or style hair.

Their habits line up with those of other pre-teen girls, a bunch that also named the family video blogs, or vlogs, "Shaytards" and "Bratayleys" among their favorite channels in the KidSay survey. The vlogs are created by real families with their real kids featured prominently. For young girls, the appeal is a connection to the family that feels more real to them than what is on TV, Burke said.

## Move Over, Cable

Hastening the move away from cable is the growth of smartphones, which are common among teens. Even tweens are getting their own devices.

"Once kids are tweens, they act like teens, and once they get a phone of their own phone, they're glued to it," said Wynee Tyree, the founder of Smarty Pants. Some kids as young as 8 are getting their own phones, she said, and "most have their own phone by the time they're 12."

If they are not getting on cellphones, then tablets or computers will do the trick. Some kids are even skillfully using them all at the same time.
