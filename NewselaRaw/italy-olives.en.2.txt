SALENTO, Italy â€” There is only one certainty in the emerging botanical crisis in southern Italy: centuries-old olive trees are dying due to the deadly Xylella fastidiosa bacterium. This disaster is occurring mainly in the region of Puglia, where acres of once picture-perfect olive groves now look like tree cemeteries. Dead trunks shoot from the earth next to other plants and flowers that have not been affected.

The rest of this situation remains far less clear. No one even knows how many trees have already died. Some estimates suggest as many as 1 million of Puglia's olive trees are infected by the bacterium. These trees are either dying on their own or are being cut down and burned by authorities who are under pressure from world leaders.

Many leaders fear that the bacteria could wipe out olive groves across Europe. Among the charred remains of a small grove, officials paint olive trees with red Xs to mark their eventual destruction.

## Accidental Infestation Versus Conspiracy Theories

No one can say exactly how this bacterium affects the trees. Nor can they say exactly how it moves or whether burning the trees works. Puglia produces more than 40 percent of Italy's olive oil. Its oil is famous throughout the world. The outbreak could cost the region more than $225 million in olive oil production losses this year. It could also result in higher olive oil prices worldwide.

Less certain still is how the bacterium was introduced to the area. The scientific community believes it was accidentally brought in with a shipment of plants from Costa Rica. Yet local Italians have their own conspiracy theories. These theories range from the intentional killing of the trees by developers who want to use the land to build resorts, to the so-called ecomafia that supposedly wants to use the land as a chemical dump. Even that a U.S. company is responsible for the disease so it can come in and rescue the area.

An even more important problem is how to keep it from spreading throughout Europe. Xylella is carried by bugs that feed on the trees' xylem, the tissue in plants that support their structure and direct water. The bug keeps the bacterium in its throat then moves among the trees and injects the bacterium when it feeds. Scientists cannot agree on how far these bugs are able to travel.

## Some Farmers Say Disease Is Unfounded

The European Union (EU) is understandably worried. They have declared that everything south of the Pugliese town of Lecce is a dead zone. The farmers in this region are very upset. "There is no such thing as Xylella," said Pasquale Spina, a farmer whose trees are in the dead zone. "Does this tree look sick to you?" he asks as he strokes new growth sprouting from the top of a stump from a supposedly infected olive tree. "Xylella only exists in the head!"

One of the heads he is referring to is that of the virologist Donato Boscia. Virologists are scientists who study viruses that affect humans, animals, insects, bacteria and plants. Dr. Boscia found the first confirmed case of X. fastidiosa in his father-in-law's olive grove in 2013. He is asking the government for money to create an outdoor research center to study the disease and find ways to stop the bacterium.

Boscia is also at the center of a criminal investigation being conducted by the court in Lecce. They are investigating the possible responsibility of scientists for either introducing the bacterium or being paid not to stop it. Boscia is not worried, at least on the surface. He vowed to continue to find enough proof to discover what is necessary to stop the bacteria. "We can't get distracted," he said. "To beat this we need to stay focused."

## Convincing People To Work Together

Science does not always do well in a land where people have a deep suspicion of authority. Boscia's main concern is convincing the public to follow the EU's plan. This is becoming increasing difficult. The lack of money offered by the EU to fight the bacterium makes discussion with the public difficult. Many growers do not trust the government and feel that they need to take care of the crisis on their own.

Few experts know as much about X. fastidiosa bacterium as Alexander Purcell, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. He has written a lot about the effects of Xylella on crops. He said that the cultural significance of the olive trees in Europe has a bigger effect than in other cases he has seen. However, he thinks that until the majority of people are willing to work together to overcome it, the disease will not slow down.

The only good news for Puglia's legendary olive growers is that the bacterium has no effect on the fruit and oil the healthy trees produce, because infected trees cannot produce olives. Thus, the only danger to people who consume the unique Pugliese oil is that there will not be enough to go around. The bad news, however, is that these ancient trees are dying fast, and with them, an ancient culture.
