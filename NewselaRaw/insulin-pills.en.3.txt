CHICAGO, Ill. â€” Five-year-old Weston Murphy has a disease called Type 1 diabetes. He cannot play too hard or go too long without eating. If he is not careful, a problem with the sugar in his blood could make him very sick. It might even send him to the hospital.

Weston's family must help him to prick his fingers several times a day. They need a drop of his blood to run a test. They use a small machine that tells them how much sugar is in his blood.

People with diabetes have too much sugar in their blood. The body needs sugar in the blood, but too much can be a bad thing. Normally, our bodies can keep just the right amount of sugar in the blood. The body uses insulin. People with diabetes do not have enough insulin.

## Watching Blood Sugar Carefully

When there is a problem with Weston's blood sugar, he might need to get a shot of insulin. Most children with diabetes need several shots each day.

A doctor might teach the patient to give themselves a shot. They might get a pump with a tiny tube that goes into their stomach. These tools help patients put insulin back into their bodies.

There are more and more people with diabetes every year. More than 1 million Americans have Type 1 diabetes. It can damage the patient's kidneys, heart and eyes.

Doctors usually notice Type 1 diabetes when children are very small. Weston's family has known about his disease for three years.

Doctors are also watching Weston's big brother, Hayden, who is 13 years old. Hayden took a blood test. It said there is a good chance he will get diabetes, too.

Hayden was very upset about the blood test. "He has the daily reminders. He sees what his brother goes through," said the boys' mom, Myra Murphy.

## Getting In On The Testing

Hayden and his family found out that a group of doctors were testing a new idea. The doctors want to keep people from getting Type 1 diabetes. They give people insulin before they need it. Hayden and his family wanted him to give it a try.

Over 400 other children and adults volunteered to help with the study, too.

Doctors give Hayden and the other volunteers insulin every day. The insulin comes in a pill instead of a shot or through a pump.

Hayden gets blood tests every once in awhile to see how he is doing. Doctors check him for signs of diabetes.

"I hope it does not come to me," he said. "I really did not want it to come to Weston."

Hayden has been taking insulin pills for three years and has not gotten diabetes. He and his family are thankful, but they are still concerned.

## Being Super Thirsty Is A Clue

Hayden and Weston have a middle brother named Daxton. He is 9. He could also get diabetes because his little brother has it.

The boys' mom says she worries every time her sons seem thirstier than usual. Doctors noticed that Weston was thirsty before they figured out he had diabetes.

She does not want her other boys to have the same life-changing challenges Weston does.

Doctors will keep studying Hayden and the other volunteers until 2017. If the pills work, they should be much less painful and less expensive than treating diabetes.
