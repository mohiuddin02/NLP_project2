MINNEAPOLIS — Bit by bit, the farm at Little Earth is growing.

So, too, is a new trend that is spreading among Native Americans across the nation. The idea is to improve the health of Indians through rediscovering the foods of their ancestors.

Little Earth is a housing complex for low-income people in south Minneapolis. Its residents live far from the natural maple syrup, wild rice and game meat their ancestors would have eaten. Yet, they are finding new old ways to grow crops that existed long before European settlers arrived.

Some even have a name for the idea: the decolonized diet — meaning, a way of eating free from the influence of European settlers and a return to traditional Indian crops.

"It's growing in the last 10 years within the native communities in the United States," said Susen Fagrelius, coordinator of Little Earth's community health projects. More people are realizing "they can grow a significant amount of vegetables on a small parcel of land," she said. They discover that "they have the ability to take back their food system."

## Gardening Projects Are Spreading

Lakota sage appears where once ordinary grass grew. Rows of Oneida cornstalks tower 6 feet in the air. Raspberries — the kind that once blanketed North American forests — cover a small patch of the farm.

Across the country, projects like the Little Earth Urban Farm are springing up. They are taking aim at the health problems that plague American Indian communities. Indian adults are twice as likely to be diagnosed with diabetes as the general population, and many are seriously overweight.

Devon Abbott Mihesuah runs the American Indian Health and Diet Project at the University of Kansas. Health problems among native people have become extremely widespread and serious, she said.

"You have no place to go but up," she added. "It has to be addressed."

When Indians were forced onto reservations, Mihesuah said, their diets changed. Government-supplied goods replaced the natural foods rich in nutrients they were used to eating.

"Type 2 diabetes didn't start showing up until after the Civil War," she said. "Up until that time there weren't any pictures of (Indian) people being fat."

## Preserving Seeds Just In Time

Fry bread is a flavorful, deep-fried dough. It's served at many Indian gatherings, but it is not a native food, Mihesuah argues. She has a bumper sticker on her car with a red line crossing out the words "fry bread." She has taken some criticism for that statement from other Indians who have called her "anti-Indian," she said.

There's been some resistance from those who do not want to give up familiar foods, but the decolonized diet idea is spreading nationwide.

In New Mexico, food programs are working to preserve seeds from hundreds of years ago. Known as heritage seeds, these are often the last link to traditional plants that have almost died out. Tribes in North Carolina are restoring native fruit and vegetable plants in newly established gardens.

The Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community is leading these efforts. Lori Watso, a nurse and Shakopee tribe member, came up with the idea for the large garden built on tribal land in Prior Lake, Minnesota.

Through food, she wanted to "help our community and other native communities" deal with a severe health crisis, she said.

## Gardens Are Growing

A number of plants in the garden come from heritage seeds. Once harvested, the fruits and vegetables are divided among Shakopee tribe members as well as other Indian communities.

Watso thinks these are the foods Native Americans are meant to eat.

"I believe in our bodies, our DNA or whatever, (we have) the ability to recognize those foods," she said. "It's in our genetic makeup — those things sustained us and I believe our bodies recognize those things."

The Shakopee Mdewakanton garden is called "Wozupi," a word that means "a place where things grow" in the Dakota language.

Since starting in 2010, the garden has more than doubled in size.

The 12-acre Wozupi now has an orchard filled with fruits local to the region — June berries, elderberries and wild plums. There is also a Heritage Garden, where ancient seeds given to them from other tribes grow. Chokecherries, prairie onions, Cherokee tomatoes and Lower Sioux corn are among the native plants recently brought back to life.

"When you pull the seeds out, people just light up," said Rebecca Yoshino, the Wozupi's director.

## Generously Sharing Seeds

Far from the wide open spaces of Shakopee, city farmers at Little Earth in Minneapolis work a tiny strip of land. The ground is contaminated, they say, so the Little Earth farmers use raised beds. They add fertile soil donated by the Shakopee tribe, which also shares seeds with this small community.

"They've been really generous," Fagrelius said. "There's been a process of awakening going on at Little Earth."

She hopes one day the tiny city farm will become fully sustainable. Plans are underway to add a greenhouse that would allow them to grow more fruits and vegetables traditionally native to the area.

If these goals are going to be achieved, Little Earth will need the help of people like George Lussier. The 68-year-old has embraced the decolonized diet and tends the farm's corn.

A member of the Red Lake nation, he grew up watching his grandmother and mother tend gardens full of vegetables.

He said he now tries to live by the words his grandmother, who lived into her 80s, would often say: "Remember the things that you were taught when you were young."
