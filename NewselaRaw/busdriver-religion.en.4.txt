MINNEAPOLIS â€” Minnesota school bus driver George Nathaniel was fired last week. The reason? He was leading kids in Christian prayers on the bus. He had been warned to stop, but kept doing it anyway. Nathaniel says his freedom of speech was denied.

Nathaniel, 49, is also a pastor. He leads two Minneapolis churches. He was in his second year as a school bus driver for a company called Durham.

After the school district complained about the prayer, Nathaniel got a warning, he said. The school district gave him bus routes at two different schools.

The warning didn't stop Nathaniel, though. "I let them know I am a pastor and I am going to pray," Nathaniel said.

## School Prayer Ruled Unconstitutional

Nathaniel continued to lead prayers on his new routes. Durham fired him on Oct. 30.

The Supreme Court ruled in 1962 that public schools may not lead students in prayer.

Courts have ruled that school prayer is forbidden by the First Amendment. This states that the government may not set up an official religion.

But Nathaniel says he wasn't doing the children any harm. "To fire a bus driver for praying for the safety of the children" is not right, he said.

Nathaniel prayed in the seven-minute ride to school after the last child got on board. "We start out with a song," he said. "Then each person will pray if they want to pray. If they don't want to pray they don't have to pray. Then I will pray and ask them if they want to join me in prayer." He said he prayed on the route all last year as well.

## Prayer "Belongs At Home"

Lawyer Teresa Nelson said Nathaniel "has the right to pray on his own time." But he doesn't have the right to pray with an "audience of kids on a school bus." Doing that, she said, is forbidden by the First Amendment.

Lawyer Marshall Tanick agrees. Nathaniel has the right to express his views, he said. But only as long as they aren't forced upon others.

The problem is that students may have felt they had to do what Nathaniel wanted, Tanick said. He could be seen as forcing the students to pray.

Gayla Colin has been a bus driver in the district for 13 years. She is a Christian, but she would never think of praying on the bus. "That belongs at home," she said.

People living in the district come from all sorts of backgrounds, Colin said. For example, there are many Muslim students.

## Driver Had Told Some Parents

Sanaa Hersi's family is Muslim. Her child goes to a school that runs buses driven by Nathaniel. Hersi doesn't like the idea of prayer on the bus. "That would confuse the kids because we teach them to pray in the Islam way."

Nikki Williams' three children also go to the same school. But she feels differently about the idea of a bus driver praying with students. "It wouldn't bother me at all," she said.

"I think if someone is praying, they can either be included in it or not," she said. "If they don't like it, they can just ignore it."

Nathaniel said he had talked with some parents. All were OK with him praying with the kids on the bus, he said.

"We got to get Christians to be able to be Christians" and not keep their faith hidden, he said. "You have something good, you are going to share it with somebody."
