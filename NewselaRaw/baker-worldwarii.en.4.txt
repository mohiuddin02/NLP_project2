INCLINE VILLAGE, Nev. â€” Ernie Feld runs a small bakery. It's called Ernie's International Pastries. He has been cooking up treats there for years. Strudel, a baked dessert, is one of the most popular items with his customers.

When he was a young man, he survived World War II. It was one of the worst wars in history. In 1939, Germany started attacking neighboring countries. Over the next few years, the country conquered most of Europe. Everywhere they went, the Germans captured Jews. They were sent to work camps and millions were killed.

The Germans who ran the camps were called Nazis.

## "Baking Saved My Life"

The Nazis killed more than 30 people in Feld's family. He survived, however. He became a prisoner at a Nazi camp and was forced to work as a cook. Because they liked his food, the Nazis did not kill him.

"Baking saved my life," Feld said. "If I wasn't a baker, I'd probably be dead."

Feld was born in 1925 in Czechoslovakia. It was a country next to Germany. Feld's father died in an accident when he was young. His mother, Sara, supported their family by running a restaurant.

Feld grew up watching her bake. Soon, he followed in her footsteps.

"When I was 14, I was always licking this and licking that," he remembered. "Mother would say, 'Are you eating again? I'm going to send you to baker's school.'"

He worked as a baker for the next three years. Then war broke out in 1939. In 1942, three years after they invaded Czechoslovakia, Nazi soldiers began rounding up Jews. The Jews were sent to camps, where millions were murdered or forced to work.

Feld was just 17 years old. He was sent by train to Hungary. There, he worked as a cook at a farm camp. Then a Nazi leader heard he was a baker. The Nazi leader needed a baker to cook for German officers at a new airport they were building. "He asked me, 'What can you cook?'" Feld remembered.

## Working In The Kitchen

Feld was chosen for the job. Over the following months, he cooked for German officers. They liked his food. His poppy-seed strudels were especially popular.

Feld asked if some of the other Jewish prisoners could work with him in the kitchen. This would keep them from having to do more difficult and dangerous jobs for the Nazis. He remembers how he and the other cooks used to bake together, feeling lucky to be alive.

By 1945, the war had turned against the Germans. The Nazis were on the run. Feld escaped and was saved by Russian soldiers. When he made it back home, he learned that his mother and younger brother, Alex, had been killed. Cousins, aunts and uncles had died, too.

## Sweet Taste Of Success

Feld eventually made his way to the San Francisco area, where he kept baking.

Now, at age 90, he is slowing down. His wife, Marika, does the baking. Since breaking his leg five months ago, he often uses a walker and wheelchair.

As Feld opened a box of old pictures, Marika whispered something to him in Hungarian.

"She wants me to say that those Nazis are probably dead, but Ernie is still making his poppy-seed strudels," Feld translated. He was smiling.
