Scientists are not singing the praises of energy drinks. A team of researchers tested one brand, the Rockstar energy drink, and found that each can packed a big punch.

A team of researchers at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, said that in just 30 minutes, one can of Rockstar boosts blood pressure and causes a fight-or-flight hormone to rise and affect the cardiovascular system, made up of the heart and blood vessels.

## Do These Ingredients Rock?

Scientists worked with 25 volunteers, 14 men and 11 women, each of whom downed a 16-ounce can of Rockstar on an empty stomach in five minutes or less. One drink contains 240 milligrams of caffeine and 2,000 milligrams of taurine. It also contains guarana seed, ginseng root and milk thistle extracts.

Taurine is amino acid that helps regulate the level of water and minerals in the blood. Some studies say it improves mental and athletic performance. Guarana is made from the seeds of a South American tree and is high in caffeine. Ginseng root is believed to provide energy and lower blood sugar, and milk thistle has a few uses including also lowering cholesterol.

Another day, the same group of people drank a placebo energy drink that had the same taste and texture as Rockstar, but none of the caffeine, taurine or other stimulants. The volunteers did not know which drink that they were getting on each day.

## Rockstar Vs. Placebo

All of the participants were healthy, with an average age of 29 and body mass index (BMI) of about 25, right on the border of normal weight and overweight. BMI is a measure of body fat based on weight and height. None of the volunteers were on medications, and none had consumed alcohol or caffeine in the 24 hours before each test.

Before drinking, researchers measured participants' heart rates and blood pressure, and took blood samples. All of the tests were repeated 30 minutes later. Just like the volunteers, the researchers conducting the tests did not know who got the real Rockstar drink and who got the placebo.

Before the drinks, volunteers had heart rates and blood pressure readings in the normal range, but after drinking Rockstar, blood pressure readings changed dramatically. Their systolic blood pressure rose an average of 6.2 percent, and their diastolic blood pressure rose an average of 6.8 percent. The placebo drinkers were better off with systolic blood pressure rising just 3.1 percent and no change at all in diastolic blood pressure.

## Blood Pressure: No Big Difference

Systolic blood pressure measures the force created in arteries when the heart beats, and diastolic blood pressure measures artery pressure between heartbeats. People with high blood pressure numbers have a greater chance of developing heart disease.

Both drinks caused the volunteers' hearts to beat faster. Rockstar drinkers averaged 3.1 additional beats per minute, and placebo drinkers averaged about 4.3 more beats per minute. Scientists said the difference between the two was unimportant.

The biggest difference was in blood levels of norepinephrine, the hormone that can lead to the so-called fight-or-flight response. Norepinephrine, released by the body, constricts blood vessels and increases blood pressure and blood sugar levels. The hormone gets blood pumping and the heart pounding and mobilizes the brain and body for action. It is related to adrenaline. When norepinephrine reaches much higher levels during situations of stress or danger, it leads to the fight-or-flight response, which prepares animals or humans to fight or flee.

## Does Stress Make A Difference?

After consuming Rockstar, the average amount of norepinephrine rose 74 percent in the blood, compared with a 31 percent increase after finishing the placebo drink.

To see whether stressful situations would affect how the energy drink works, researchers asked the volunteers to answer math questions, squeeze a hand grip or put a hand in ice water for two minutes. None of the activities had any extra effect.

The researchers do worry about the other results, however. In a recent study published by the Journal of the American Medical Association, they said that increases in blood pressure and norepinephrine after consuming an energy drink like Rockstar could make people more likely to develop heart disease.

They also said that results might be different with another energy drink or a larger group of volunteers.
