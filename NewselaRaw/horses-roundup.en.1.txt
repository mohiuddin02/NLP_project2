The argument between the federal government and animal advocates over the removal of wild mustangs from the Western range got a bit worse even after the government announced plans to take fewer horses from the land this summer.

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) said last week that it would remove 1,300 horses in the coming months, many of which might otherwise die from lack of food and water. The announcement comes even though its holding capacity for captured wild horses has nearly reached its limit at 50,000 animals nationwide.

Animal advocates say 1,300 horses are still too many, and they question the bureau's reasons for the removals.

The BLM is responsible for 264 million acres across the United States. It has said previously there are too many horses on the wild range for the lands to sustain. Supporters of wild horses say this is not true. They argue that the agency is really favoring the interests of ranchers whose cattle and sheep graze upon the public lands.

## 16 Summer Roundups

Nine of the bureau's 16 summer roundups will be conducted in Nevada, home to roughly half of the estimated 37,000 free-roaming wild horses and burros in the West. The agency plans to remove 855 wild horses and burros in Nevada, 140 in Oregon, 105 in Arizona, 65 in New Mexico, 50 in Colorado and 25 in Idaho.

On Tuesday, the agency said it would relocate 50 wild horses threatened by drought from an area two hours north of Las Vegas. BLM officials said some animals that are suffering might have to be killed.

"The drought conditions are so severe we're going to see die-offs," bureau spokesman Tom Gorey said.

The BLM has been closely monitoring the drought. Since early July, it has been supplementing the natural water supplies, filling tubs and troughs with water and providing hay to the horses.

Unfortunately, these animals are extremely skittish and will not drink from the man-made containers. Even with the extra water, the ground does not provide enough water to sustain them, Gorey said.

"It's contrary to the cliche â€” we're bringing the water to the horse, but the animals still won't drink it," he said. "Horses will die. It's not going to be pretty."

## Wild Horse Policy Under Fire

The BLM has been under fire for what many have called its failing policies toward wild horses. The animals have been blamed for range damage despite the fact that their numbers are heavily overshadowed by grazing domestic cattle.

Independent scientists reviewed the agency's horse roundups and released a report in May. The document recommended that the government invest in widespread fertility control of the mustangs and let nature cull any excess herds.  It should not spend millions to house them in overflowing holding pens, the study said.

The 14-member panel concluded BLM's removal of nearly 100,000 horses from the Western range over the last decade is probably doing the opposite of the desired effect. It is not limiting ecological damage nor reducing overpopulated herds.

In June, 30 members of the House of Representatives urged new U.S. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell to reform the government's wild horse management program and its spiraling budget. A big part of the budget goes to the high cost of corralling and removing the animals from the range.

For the 12 months that end in September, the BLM plans to remove 4,800 mustangs from the range. That is down from 8,255 in the last year, Gorey said. The reduction is due to overstocked corrals.

In a statement, the American Wild Horse Preservation Campaign coalition criticized the BLM's plans.

"The BLM is galloping ahead with rounding up more wild horses, despite the high cost to taxpayers and animals, as well as the findings of an independent scientific review," said coalition spokeswoman Suzanne Roy.

## Helicopters To Drive Animals

Six of the Nevada roundups will employ contract helicopters to drive the animals to pens. The rest of the operations will use bait and water to trap them in corrals.

Sally Summers is the founder of the Reno-based group Horse Power, which has called for a stop to the capturing of horses and burros. She said the BLM's planned areas for its water traps is the same area that is at the center of a lawsuit by advocates for better monitoring access of helicopter roundups.

"They're doing water traps because they knew we won't have access to monitor what they're doing," Summers said. "Do they make sure there is enough water in those traps? Do they check them enough times a day to collect horses out in the middle of the heat? We won't know, because they won't let us near those traps to watch their tactics."

She added: "The BLM is tired of people picking it apart. They want to do what they do in secrecy."

Gorey lashed back at critics.

"On one hand, they imply that if Mother Nature kills off the horses from thirst or starvation, that's OK," he said. "But if we intervene to save these horses, that's unacceptable."

"Where is the reasoning in that argument? I don't see it," he said.
