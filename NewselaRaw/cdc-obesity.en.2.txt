NEW YORK, N.Y. â€” Obesity is still rising among American adults, despite more than 10 years of government attempts to get people to watch their weight. Meanwhile, women now have a higher rate of obesity than men, new government research shows.

To be obese, a person is so overweight that it becomes a health problem. For the past several years, experts thought the nation's decades-long rise in obesity had stopped. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a government agency, said in a report Nov. 12 that the obesity rate climbed to nearly 38 percent of adults in 2013-14. Ten years earlier, that figure was just 32 percent.

"This is a striking finding" and suggests that the situation is getting worse, said Dr. William Dietz. He is an obesity expert at George Washington University.

But another expert, the University of North Carolina's Barry Popkin, urged caution. He said the participants selected for the study might not be representative of the nation as a whole.

## Experts Unsure Of Reason

Experts said they had no explanation for why the obesity rate appears to be rising.

The report also found more women than men were obese. Obesity rates for men and women had been roughly the same for about 10 years. However, in the new report, the rate was significantly higher for women, at 38 percent. The rate for men was 34 percent.

Obesity means being not just overweight, but seriously overweight. It is considered one of the nation's leading public health problems, and can lead to diabetes, heart disease and even death. Until the early 1980s, only about 1 in 6 adults were obese, but the rate climbed dramatically until it hit about 1 in 3 around 10 years ago.

The new figures come from a regular government survey that has about 5,000 participants each year. In interviews, people tend to say their weight is lower than it really is and say they are taller than they are. But participants in this survey are actually weighed. Because of that, it is considered to be the best study for measuring obesity in the United States.

## Programs Encourage Healthy Habits

The news comes after years of government anti-obesity campaigns to encourage people to eat better and exercise. Also, soda consumption has dropped in recent years, and fast-food chains have made their menus more healthy.

New federal rules have also been adopted to remove artificial trans fats from grocery store foods. Trans fats can increase a person's risk of heart disease. Other rules require chain restaurants to post calorie counts, although those have not gone into effect yet.

The widening gap between men and women seems to be driven by what is happening among blacks and Hispanics, said the CDC's Cynthia Ogden. She is the study's lead author.

Obesity rates for white men and white women remain very close. But for blacks, the female obesity rate has soared to 57 percent, far above the male rate of 38 percent. The gap is widening among Hispanics, too. The rate among Hispanic women is 46 percent, and it is 39 percent for men.

## Young Children A Hopeful Sign

The report also looked at obesity in children but did not see much change. For young people ages 2 to 19, the rate has been holding at about 17 percent over the past 10 years or so.

Health officials have been especially focused on obesity in kids. They are the target of the Let's Move campaign launched by first lady Michelle Obama in 2010.

A CDC report last year noted one possible glimmer of hope: a decline in obesity among children ages 2 to 5. Their rate had fallen to about 8 percent in the 2011-12 survey, down from 14 percent a decade earlier.

In a piece of good news, the new report suggests that the decline among toddlers was real. The rate was found to be holding pretty much steady around 9 percent.

The CDC measures obesity by calculating Body Mass Index, a ratio of weight to height. For adults, a BMI of 25 to 29.9 is overweight, and 30 or higher is obese. According to CDC definitions, a 5-foot-10-inch man is overweight at 174 pounds and obese at 209 pounds.
