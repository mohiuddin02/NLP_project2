WASHINGTON â€” In May 1995, geophysicist H. Jay Melosh attended a meeting of U.S. and Russian nuclear weapons designers. To his surprise, the former enemies were eager to work together. They warned of an unlikely but dangerous threat from space: asteroids that might someday be headed straight for Earth.

First Edward Teller, the father of the hydrogen bomb, spoke up. He urged the others to consider building huge, new nuclear weapons to protect the planet. Then some top Russian weapons experts lent their support.

## Building "The Biggest Bombs Ever"

It was really strange, Melosh said, to see scientists agree to build "the biggest bombs ever."

Since then he has been speaking out against the idea. He argues that non-nuclear solutions are both possible and far less dangerous.

But Melosh suffered a setback last month. The United States signed a new agreement with Russia that could lead to new cooperation between nuclear weapons scientists. "Defense from asteroids" was mentioned as one possible area of study.

President Barack Obama wants a world without nuclear weapons. But NASA is still interested in their use against asteroids. Every year it spends hundreds of thousands of dollars to study the idea.

Weapons experts also are focusing on asteroids. They see them as a reason to build very powerful nuclear bombs. This is true not only in the United States, but in Russia as well.

To some, the idea seems like bad science fiction. It sounds, they say, like something out of the 1998 Bruce Willis action film "Armageddon." In that movie, a team lands on an asteroid headed for earth. They plant a nuclear warhead on it and blow the rock into halves that just miss Earth.

Some experts worry about radioactive debris. Such bits and pieces would be created by blasting an asteroid with a bomb. They could cause terrible damage on Earth, experts say.

## Supporters Say If No Time, Bombing The Only Option

But the bomb idea has strong supporters as well. Bong Wie heads the Asteroid Deflection Research Center. He said he is designing a "hypervelocity nuclear interceptor system." Basically, that's a nuclear missile fitted with a battering ram.

The battering ram would separate from the bomb before the bomb hit the asteroid, he said. It would gouge a crater into the asteroid. Then, the bomb would smash into the crater and blast the asteroid to bits.

Engineer Keith Holsapple is another supporter. He is now studying ways to knock an Earth-bound asteroid from its path. He is considering both nuclear explosions and battering rams.

The leading U.S. supporter of the nuclear solution is probably David S.P. Dearborn. He is both a research scientist and a weapons designer.

Nuclear weapons could be used in two ways, he said. If an asteroid was still far away, a nuclear blast could knock it off course. If time was shorter, defenders would try to blow up the asteroid.

"You fragment it with enough force so that the pieces spread out," he said. That way, they mostly miss the Earth. Small bits of rock would burn up in the atmosphere.

There would be no need to build new weapons, he said. But to shatter a large asteroid you probably would need a weapon with a blast equal to 1 million tons of TNT. This is roughly the power of the largest bomb the U.S. has.

Physicist Mark Boslough has studied the possible effects of nuclear blasts on asteroids. He agrees that on short notice nuclear "really is the only option."

## Alternatives to Bombs

Melosh disagrees. Ninety percent of the biggest asteroids have already been found. Scientists have decided they are not a threat to Earth anytime soon. So there is time to find non-nuclear alternatives. These include hitting asteroids with battering rams, zapping them with lasers or tugging them off their path.

Melosh has tested one of his ideas. In 2005 he served on a NASA mission known as Deep Impact. During the mission, NASA launched an 820-pound battering ram that gouged a crater out of the comet Tempel 1.

To work at all, he said, bombs would need to be more powerful than any ever built. A lot more people, he warned, have been killed by nuclear weapons than by asteroids.
