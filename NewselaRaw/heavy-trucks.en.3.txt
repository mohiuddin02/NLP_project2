WATFORD CITY, N.D. — The dump truck rumbled over miles of unpaved roads. It drove past cattle and haystacks to the dirt pit.

When it arrived, truck driver Bill Gore made a signal to pile the dirt high. When the truck left, it weighed more than 100,000 pounds. Its legal limit is 82,000 pounds.

"We try to run it as hard as we can," Gore said.

These are the oil fields of Bakken, North Dakota. An oil boom is happening here. The area produces more than 1 million barrels of oil a day. Heavy trucks carry water, pipes and sand. They bring oil to pipelines and trains to ship it. They also carry dirt and construction materials.

Many truckers, like Gore, carry loads that are too heavy. State officials think that one-quarter of the Bakken's water trucks alone are overloaded.

## It's Harder To Stop Safely

Overloaded trucks can be dangerous. The extra weight makes it harder for drivers to stop quickly and increases the amount of damage in a crash. Severe injuries from truck crashes have jumped over four years.

According to the Truck Safety Coalition, 100,000-pound trucks take 25 percent longer to stop than 80,000-pound trucks. Say the 80,000-pound truck is moving at a certain speed. It might take that truck 100 feet to stop. But, the 100,000-pound truck would take 125 feet to stop at the same speed.

"It's the stopping power," said Mike Fisher, who drives overweight trucks. "Your brakes are set up to stop a certain amount of weight, and if you increase that, you have a lot more chance of something going wrong."

Heavy trucks ruin bridges. They also crumble prairie roads. Then the state has to pay to fix them.

## A Heavy Truck Makes More Money

McKenzie County produces the most oil of any county in the state. Its tiny sheriff's office gives out big tickets. One truck was pulled over this summer for being 61,300 pounds overweight. Another trucker was caught driving 76,100 pounds overweight.

Drivers described the pressure to "haul heavy." If truck drivers are paid by the hour, they do not overload the truck. But some trucking jobs pay by weight. Then truckers make more money if they overload the truck.

"We didn't come to North Dakota for the scenery. We're here for money," said truck driver Jesse Scheffler. He once got a $3,000 ticket for driving a truck that was 20,000 pounds overweight.

McKenzie County has only two officers responsible for stopping trucks and checking they are not overweight.

"(The state's) lack of enforcement causes trucks to be out there that are unsafe," said Scott Luhman. He is a McKenzie County sheriff's police deputy.

The North Dakota Highway Patrol ticketed 1,318 overweight trucks last year. In 2012, state troopers issued 1,701 tickets. Captain Eldon Mehrer said he is not sure why the number of tickets went down, but he thought truckers were worried they would get caught.

## Fill It Up!

Bakken's trucking business includes a mix of larger and smaller companies.

The bigger companies tend to follow the rules more, Luhman said. "It is the smaller companies. It's Joe Blow … that's out here trying to save his family. He's going to push the rules a little bit more."

On a Sunday morning, Fisher chugged down Route 200. He turned onto an unpaved road and bounced over potholes on the way to a dirt pit.

He and his friend Gore were told the job would pay $9.50 per ton of dirt. A ton is equal to 2,000 pounds.

At the dirt pit, he pulled onto the scale so his truck could be measured empty. Then, he got into line. Fisher signaled that he wanted 35 tons of dirt. The dirt was loaded into his truck. Fisher gave a thumbs up and pulled onto the scale.

Although his truck's limit was 80,000 pounds, it weighed a little more than 104,000.

"You're a lightweight," Gore joked.
