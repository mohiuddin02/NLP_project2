HIGHLAND PARK, Ill. â€” Alan Brint has a clear vision of how he wants other people to see him. Brint was born blind, but he wants to be treated no differently than anyone else.

This attitude is especially clear at the swimming pool. There, Brint has spent the last four years training with and swimming against competitors with full vision.

Brint is in his fourth year at Highland Park High School in Highland Park, Illinois. At a recent boys state swimming competition, he competed in all four of the events for athletes with disabilities. He did not win any but he swam faster than he ever did before in all four. Swimmers keep track of their times for various races. Even if they don't win, they can be happy if they get their fastest time ever. They call this a personal best. He finished third in two races and fourth in two others. The four personal bests made the swim meet a good conclusion to his high school career.

## Good Competition

"I would have liked to have gone a little faster, especially in the breaststroke," said Brint, who began swimming as a young child. "But you can't be too disappointed in setting" personal-best records.

"I like that I had good competition in every race," he said. "In all the races, there was someone who I barely beat or who barely beat me and that makes it worthwhile."

One of the reasons for Brint's success is that he treats swimming like he does everything else in his life. For him, getting better is the only option.

That has meant a lot of 4:45 a.m. wake-up calls. It also means working hard on the fine details of swimming. He practices swimming as straight as possible and learning when he's getting close to the wall.

## Counting Strokes, Training Hard

"He counts strokes, absolutely," said Tim Sirois, his high school swim coach. "At a meet, we'll tap him to let him know when to turn, when to finish."

Brint had this year's meet circled on his calendar since last summer. He has been training hard ever since.

"Last year I wasn't the most motivated swimmer, but this year that all changed," said Brint, He will study business next year at Beloit College in Wisconsin. Brint said he trained hard last summer. He went into the high school season in great shape.

Other people may be amazed at what Brint has accomplished. It comes as no surprise to those who know him.

"The thing with Alan is that he can swim so well," said teammate Eddie Hochman. He has known Brint since sixth grade. "He's always looking for more ways to challenge himself, and it's important to him that people treat him the same as everyone else."

## One Of The Guys

Brint does receive some assistance to ensure his safety. He holds a cane to help guide him around the pool at swim competition. At the state meet, one of the coaches helped him find his way around the unfamiliar area.

Before he started high school, he spent hours roaming the halls. He learned how to find his way around by counting his steps. He walks through the school's maze of hallways without a second thought. At the pool, he is just one of the guys.

"I've been swimming for a long time and it gives me a lot of pleasure," Brint said. "But the (friendship) with my teammates is the most important thing to me. I couldn't appreciate my teammates more."

## Pushing To Get Better

Brint's swimming at the state meet seemed smooth. However, his journey has not been risk-free. One person who has been there every step of the way is Brint's father, David.

"He's learned an interesting balance between advocating for himself and being respectful as a good teammate," David Brint said. "Something every child should learn how to do is push themselves to see how good they can be. He's figured out ways to do that."

He added, "When a kid has a disability like Alan does and he finds ways around it, it's pretty special. I'm really proud of him."
