Some art looks just like a photograph. Some art is a little less like real-life. At the end of the 1800s in France, a type of art style became popular.

It was called Impressionism. Impressionism is a type of art that uses quick brush strokes and bright colors. The paintings can be of people or land. They mostly look like fuzzy pictures.

People have tried guessing when Impressionism began. Now, a scientist has solved the art world's mystery. He says he has discovered the moment Impressionism was born.

## Doing Detective Work On Art

Claude Monet was the first Impressionist. He was a French painter. His first Impressionist painting was called "Impression, Sunrise." It shows the harbor in the city of LeHavre, France.

Donald Olson thinks the scene was painted on Nov. 13, 1872, at about 7:35 a.m. Olson is a scientist at Texas State University in San Marcos. He is also called an art detective.

Art experts have argued where Monet's famous painting was done. They did not agree on when he painted it. Some said his orange skies were actually of a sunset.

Olson looked at old photos and maps of Le Havre. He eventually discovered the room where Monet painted it.

Then, Olson did some math. He figured out how far the sun was from the horizon, where the sky meets land. From this, he discovered the time of year and time of day it was painted.

## Big Clue: Old Weather Reports

Olson got a surprise. He found old weather reports from LeHavre. They were his next clue. Olson checked the sky and weather. Smoke in Monet's painting drifts from east to west. This means the wind was blowing from the east. Only two dates had winds blowing from the east.

On Nov. 15, 1872, at 7:35 a.m., the records noted light winds from the southeast. There was mist, fog and calm seas. The same weather pattern is seen in the famous painting.

Olson tried to solve the Monet sunrise mystery for about 15 years. French museum officials asked him to take another look at Monet's sunrise. They wanted to show the painting in an exhibit.

They especially wanted to learn when it was painted. Olson was now able to tell them. The exhibit will open Sept. 18. It will be at the Musee Marmottan Monet in Paris, France.
