WASHINGTON, D.C. â€” All around us, things are happening in the world. The news tells us what is going on. People get their news in different ways. Some people watch TV or use a computer or cellphone, while others ask their friends or parents.

A new study wanted to find out how millennials get their news. Millennials are people between the ages of 18 and 34.

The study looked at how millennials use technology to get their news. It found that black and white millennials use technology just as much to search for news.

Experts used to worry about this. They thought that people of color would not have the same chance to use technology.

## Millennials Like Social Media

In general, two out of three black or white millennials say they read and watch news online regularly. About half of Hispanic millennials say they get their news online.

Millennials are getting their news from social media. They could be using Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, or other social media websites or apps. Millennials spend less time reading newspapers.

More than half of millennials say they get news from Facebook at least once a day. Four out of five say they get it from Facebook at least once a week.

## Blacks And Hispanics Love Smartphones

Tom Rosenstiel runs the group that did the study. He said people of color use technology just as often, and just as well, as white people.

In the 1990s, some experts worried that people of color could not afford to buy technology. The experts thought minorities would not have the same chance to use technology as white people.

The study shows that they were wrong.

Eventually, people of color became some of the biggest users of certain forms of technology. They are big users of smartphones.

Nearly all millennials use smartphones. Half of them use a tablet such as an iPad.

## Facebook, YouTube And Streaming

The study found that millennials of all races get news on Facebook. There were differences in how they used Facebook, though. African-Americans post the most about the news they read. Fewer whites and Hispanics post things.

African-Americans are also more likely to use Facebook for keeping up with "trending" stories. Trending stories are ones that many people are talking about. About two out of five African-American millennials use Facebook for this purpose. Only about one-third of whites and about one-fourth of Hispanics use Facebook for trending stories.

The study found that Hispanic and African-American millennials are more likely to get their news from YouTube and Instagram. White millennials are less likely to use them for news.

Rosenstiel says YouTube is popular. He thinks it is because millennials can post any videos they like.

Rosenstiel says many people like to read about things that are not mainstream. Some stories are a bit unusual. They are outside the mainstream. He says young people like to have control over what they read.

The study found that African-American millennials favorite thing to do online is to stream music, TV or movies. Hispanic millennials like keeping up with their friends the most. White millennials like sending email.

## Tech Use Is "Common Ground"

Although the study showed that millennials of different races like to use social media for different purposes, the poll found that people in this age group are actually more alike than anyone had thought.

"Millennials' similarities are much greater than the differences people thought that there were going to be," Rosenstiel said. "We've created new common ground."

The survey of 1,045 young adults was conducted from Jan. 5 through Feb. 2, 2015.

The survey was conducted online. People were interviewed in English and Spanish. All the people were between ages 18 and 34. They were chosen randomly. Any person could have been chosen. The people who took part were screened first over the phone.
