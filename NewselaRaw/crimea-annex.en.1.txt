SIMFEROPOL, Ukraine — In a historic move that will change the face of Europe, Russia seized Crimea and its vital naval port of Sevastopol on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, President Vladimir Putin signed agreements with the Ukrainian region's Moscow-backed leaders. This came less than two days after Crimean residents backed secession in a widely criticized vote.

The signing is not yet official. It has to be approved by the Russian parliament and the Constitutional Court, which are steps that are seen as formalities. The signing ceremony was held in the lavish St. George's Hall in the Kremlin, a historic fortress in Moscow. Shortly before, Putin gave a fiery hour-long speech often interrupted by applause from the jubilant crowd of lawmakers, government officials and others.

## Putin Blames Russophobes

The decision was based, Putin said, on the Crimean people's "free expression of the will" in Sunday's referendum, a popular vote in which more than 96 percent of Crimeans supported joining Russia.

In his speech, Putin blamed Ukraine's "nationalists, Russophobes and anti-Semites." Putin said they came to power in Ukraine last month when the country's pro-Russia leader fled following violent protests against his government. A Russophobe is a person who is anti-Russian, and an anti-Semite is someone who hates Jews.

Putin refused to acknowledge that Russian troops had invaded Crimea before the referendum. His army forces, wearing unmarked uniforms, largely took control of the peninsula late last month. The Russian soldiers have been blocking the Ukrainian military in their bases ever since, though Putin — as he has in the past — referred to the invaders as Crimean "self-defense forces."

"Esteemed residents of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, all of Russia admires your fortitude, dignity and courage," he said in his televised speech. Sevastopol is the port in Crimea where the Russian Navy's Black Sea Fleet is based. "It is you who have resolved the fate of Crimea."

## U.S. And European Union Sanctions

In the face of international condemnation for what is widely viewed as a land grab and a violation of international law, Putin noted sanctions imposed Monday by the United States and European Union. The U.S. and the European have imposed a series of punishments — sanctions — on Russian officials, and are threatening further punishments.

"I would like to know what they mean," Putin said of the sanctions. "The actions ... of various national traitors?"

He added, "We view such statements as irresponsible and openly aggressive, and we will react accordingly."

Russia will not seek confrontation with Western countries, Putin pledged, and will do its best to build good relations with its neighbors and other countries.

Putin insisted that Russia would not invade the industrial southeast of Ukraine, which like Crimea has a large Russian-speaking population. "We have always respected the territorial (unity) of Ukraine," he said, addressing the people of Ukraine. "Don't trust those who scare you with Russia."

## Historically Russian

That said, Putin implied that southeastern Ukraine was historically Russian territory. After the 1917 Russian Revolution, which transformed Russia into the Soviet Union, the Soviets "out of some considerations of their own, let God be their judge, included significant parts of the historically Russian south lands," he said.

Russia controlled the Crimean peninsula until 1954 when the leader of the Soviet Union, Nikita Kruschev, transferred it to Ukraine. Ukraine gained its independence in 1991 after the Soviet Union fell, leaving some Russians in newly independent lands. Putin once called the end of the Soviet Union "the biggest geopolitical catastrophe" of the 20th century.

Last month, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych fled the country after the bloody crackdown against months of protests had left many people dead. A pro-Western government took over.

In his speech Tuesday, as he has before, Putin called the change of power a coup d'état, an illegal seizure of power. He said that Ukraine's temporary government was unlawful and not worth talking to.

He blamed the U.S. and Western Europe, saying they encouraged those who organized the protests.

The U.S. and Europe "acted roughly, irresponsibly and unprofessionally," Putin said. "They knew quite well millions of Russians live in Ukraine and Crimea." Putin said they should have known what would have happened.

## "Strong And Stable Sovereignty"

"Today it is necessary to stop the hysterics ... and recognize the obvious thing that Russia is an independent and active participant in the international life. And like other countries it has its national interests which should be taken into account and respected," Putin said.

Putin promised that the interests of all of Crimea's ethnic groups would be respected and that the peninsula would have three state languages: Russian, Ukrainian and Tatar.

"Crimea will remain Russian, Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar but it will never be" fascist, Putin concluded. Fascism is a form of government characterized by complete government control. "Crimea is ... under the strong and stable sovereignty which today in fact can be only Russian."
