CHICAGO, Ill. — Computer programming can be a great job. Most high school students do not know much about it. One of them is Darius Taplet.

He is learning, though. He goes to Wells Community Academy in Chicago. All Wells students are learning coding. A computer program is a set of instructions for computers. It tells computers how to do something. Coding is another name for it.

## Making A Game

Darius is 17 years old. Wells had a coding program for students. Darius made a simple computer program. He made a simple game. It was based on Star Wars. He said it was amazing. He never thought his program would come out so well. Now, Darius is thinking about making computer games one day.

Computer science is one of the best-paying jobs. Yet there are not enough workers. Companies cannot find enough people. About 500,000 computer science jobs are empty, the government said. Yet most students do not learn anything about coding.

## Coding Classes Needed

Google discovered something interesting. Most schools do not offer coding classes.

Some Chicago schools are trying to change that. They are adding computer programming classes.

Soon, it might be as important as math or science. 

A group called Coding.org is trying to change things. It thinks that all students should learn coding. It wants them to begin in kindergarten. The group has coding programs in many American schools. One of the largest is in Chicago Public Schools. The district plans to teach all its students to code.

## Excited About Coding

Brenda Wilkerson is the head of its computer science program. People are really excited. 

More than 100 Chicago schools teach coding.

One of them is Wells school.

A.J. Moore is a student. A.J. is 17 years old. He really enjoys coding. He likes making new programs. Coders can earn a lot of money, he said. Even coders who make simple games can become rich.

## Believe You Can Do It!

A.J. said there are many coding jobs. People do not know about them, though.

Shadia Daniels works at Wells school. She teaches students computer science. She knows coding is important for their future. Some students are not sure. They cannot believe they can be computer scientists one day.

Shadia says she believes students can learn these skills. She says students need to believe it too.
