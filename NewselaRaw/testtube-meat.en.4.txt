Two professors have a plan to feed the world. Their idea is man-made meat.

You can make an unlimited amount of it, they argue. It's good for the environment. And it doesn't hurt any animals.

The two professors are Cor van der Weele and Johannes Tramper. They are from Wageningen University. It is the only university in the Netherlands to focus on healthy food and the environment. Their article about their plan was published Tuesday.

The good news is that many parts of the world are becoming richer. The bad news is that more and more people will want to eat more meat, they say. That will cause more pollution. It will also use up too much gas and electricity, and make animals suffer.

They say people will have to find other types of protein. People could get protein from vegetables, like soybeans. They can also eat insects. Bugs contain a lot of protein.

The Dutch professors came up with another idea: hamburger meat grown in huge tanks. Sounds better than bugs, doesn't it?

## Meat Clump Cakes

One day, they say, every town will grow its own meat.

This is how it would work. Muscle cells would be taken from pigs, cows, chicken, fish or other animals. The cells would grow in 5,200-gallon tanks full of seaweed-like plants. Paddles would keep the whole thing in motion.

In a month, chemicals would be added. The chemicals will make the meat cells stick together. They will form small clumps. And the clumps can be pressed into dense cakes and sold.

Man-made meat won't save much electricity, the authors wrote. But it would help prevent [global warming](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming). It would also use much less water and land. Raising beef uses up lot of land and water.

A tank could make about 56,000 pounds of meat a year. In other words, it could save the lives of 112 beef cattle. In a year, a tank could feed more than 2,500 people.

The professors say the advantages of man-made meat are clear. But they won't promise that anyone will want to eat it.
