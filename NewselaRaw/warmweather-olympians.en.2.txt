SOCHI, Russia â€” Skier Mathilde Amivi Petitjean was recruited for Togo's first Winter Olympics team over the Internet.

Petitjean, 19, who has a Togolese mother, grew up in the French Alps and skied for France.

Alpine skier Alessia Afi Dipol is another member of Team Togo whose feet have barely touched the West African nation's soil. Dipol, 18, is an Italian who has skied for India.

But to Togo Olympic Committee Vice President Kelani Bayor, they bleed the Togolese national colors of yellow, red and green.

"These are true blue Togolese," Kelani insisted in French. Petitjean and Dipol may not live in Togo, Kelani said. But they have family ties to the tropical country. And for Togo, like many countries, that's good enough.

## Pushing The Limits

Togo's tiny Olympic team is one of seven warm-weather countries participating in the Winter Games for the first time. The others are Dominica, East Timor, Malta, Paraguay, Tonga and Zimbabwe. They all marched in the parade of nations at Sochi's opening ceremony Friday.

"If I was told I would one day compete at the Olympic Games, I would never have believed it would be in the colors of Togo," Petitjean said.

These Olympic newbies lack mountains, snow, facilities or knowledge of winter sports. To field teams, they are pushing the limits of Olympic citizenship and residency rules.

The Dominica cross-country ski team, for example, comes from Staten Island, N.Y. Gary and Angelica di Silvestri, a husband and wife in their 40s, volunteered in the tiny Caribbean nation. They were granted citizenship in return, which lets them ski for Dominica.

Some of the new Olympians were born in the country they represent but didn't stay there long. Paraguayan slopestyle skier Julia Marino was born in Paraguay. But she was adopted by an American family and moved to the United States when she was less than a year old.

Marino, a Boulder, Colo., resident, skied for the United States until last year. She has visited Paraguay just once. "I'm going to spend a bit more time down there," she said Tuesday. "They have a great national Olympic Committee and I can learn more about my country."

## The New Normal

Zimbabwe alpine skier Luke Henri Steyn was born in Harare, the country's capital. But his family moved to Switzerland, where he started skiing at age 2. He was studying at the University of Colorado in Boulder before taking a year off to focus on the Sochi Games.

The Winter Olympic rookie nations aren't the only ones with nation-hopping athletes. Prized South Korean speed skater Ahn Hyun-soo is competing in Sochi for Russia. He now calls himself Viktor Ahn. He switched countries after South Korea didn't send him to the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver.

Foreign Policy magazine's website recently called these Olympians "carpetbaggers" with loose ties to their motherlands. After the American Civil War, Northerners who moved to the South to take advantage of the situation were called carpetbaggers. "Even as the Games embrace the (speech) of national pride, opportunism knows no borders," said the magazine.

Changing countries has become the new normal.

Although athletes must be citizens of the countries they represent, Olympic rules are flexible.

Some countries are so hungry for Olympic attention and glory, that changing countries has become the new norm among athletes getting recruited by those countries.

Countries are enabling athletes to change their citizenship "to make their presence felt on the world stage," said Janice Forsythe. She directs the International Centre for Olympic Studies at Western University in Canada. "In Canada, we move elite athletes to the front of the immigration line, speeding up their immigration papers in time for the Olympics."

## Tropical Winter Sport Powerhouse?

Togo discovered Petitjean online. The nation's new sliding sports committee contacted her after she posted a positive comment on Facebook about Gervacio Madja. He is a Togolese-born, Munich-raised cross-country skier.

"We first got in touch with (Petitjean) in May 2013," saidf Hyacinthe Edorh. He is head of the Togolese team at the Sochi Games. "With Mathilde we are certain she will surprise everyone because she is only 19 years old and she is capable of competing for the next 10 to 15 years."

Togo's presence at the Winter Games is part of an ambitious plan to make the tropical country a warm-weather winter sport powerhouse.

"We would like to be present in all competitions in the Winter Games. And (we) want to carry out our project all over Africa," Hyacinthe said.

But for now, Team Togo has enough work to do in its own country.

"Some people in Togo don't know what slalom is," Kelani said. Slalom is a zig-zag course marked by flags that skiers ski through. "I will explain to them."
