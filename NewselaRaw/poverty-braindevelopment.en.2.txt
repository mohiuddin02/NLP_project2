Growing up in poverty affects American children in a number of ways. A new study published this week shows that one effect of poverty is that it can harm brain development.

It has long been known that growing up poor is linked to poorer performance in school. The new study examines how poverty affects both school performance and brain development. It shows that growing up poor harms children's brain development. It also reveals that differences in brain development between rich and poor children may account for up to 20 percent of the differences in their school performance.

## Scanning And Studying Brains

In other words, scientists now have a partial answer to the question of why poverty makes it harder to succeed in school: it harms brain development.

The study was carried out by psychologist Seth Pollak at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison. He studied a group of 389 people from age 4 to 22. Some of the study participants came from low-income households, while others came from middle- and high-income homes.

The researchers examined the size of certain areas of the participants' brains. To do so, they used a machine called an MRI scanner, which uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create images of the body. The researchers were particularly interested in the parts of the brain that are essential to academic success, and how brain development is affected by a person's environment as a child.

## Less Brain Tissue

Pollack and the other researchers then compared the brains of participants who grew up poor with the brains of those who grew up in higher-income households. To define "poor," they used the federal poverty line, which is decided by the government. According to the federal poverty line, a family of four making less than $24,250 is considered to be poor.

The results of the study were clear. Low incomes affected the brain development of kids who were otherwise healthy. The researchers found that the brains of children who grew up in poor households had 8 to 10 percent less gray matter than the brains of other children. Gray matter is a kind of brain tissue.

The researchers did not find differences between children from middle class and wealthy families, however. Income only seemed to affect the brain development of participants in low-income households. In other words, more money does not necessarily mean better brain development. Not having enough money for basic needs, though, can lead to worse brain development. Children living only 50 percent above the poverty line (an income of $36,375 for a family of four) showed gray matter volumes 3 percent to 4 percent below normal.

## Age Does Not Close The Gap

Pollak was hoping to see the gap closing as children grew older and spent more time in school and outside their homes, but this was not the case. The gap in brain development was still present at age 22.

The researchers also looked at subjects' success in school. Similar to its effect on brain development, poverty negatively affects academic performance. This finding suggests that one of the ways that poverty limits students' performance is by harming their brain development.

"This was an important study," says Joan Luby. She is a doctor at the Washington University School of Medicine in Saint Louis, Missouri, and was not part of this study. Luby notes that the study helps explain the link between poverty and academic achievement. She adds that it can give clues about how children growing up in poverty can be supported.

## Few Resources, Lots Of Stress

Many students grow up in poor households. A recent report revealed that in 2013, 51 percent of students in U.S. public schools were from low-income families. Growing up poor exposes these children to a number of challenges, including unsafe neighborhoods, stressed parents, and unhealthy diets. It is difficult to pinpoint which of these factors harm brain development and school performance.

In future studies, Pollak and his group hope to identify how different social programs, such as free lunch programs, can help children who grow up poor. "I used to think about poverty as a question of social policy. Now I think of it as a biomedical problem," Pollak says. He now views poverty as a toxin that is making children less healthy.
