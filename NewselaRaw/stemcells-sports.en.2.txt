C.J. Nitkowski had nothing to lose in spring 2011. The tendons and muscles in his left shoulder, that he'd relied on during his 10 years as a major league pitcher, were in tatters. He was 38 and his fastball traveled just 50 miles an hour.

Surgery and a lengthy rehabilitation after would have ended his career. So Nitkowski paid $3,000 to have stem cells taken from his waist, separated and then injected back into his shoulder. It's called stem cell therapy, and it's a new medical procedure. Stem cells from one part of the body are used to treat an illness or disease in another.

## "I Can't Recommend It"

"I look at it as a last shot," Nitkowski said.

The "boost" he felt from the procedure helped him sign a minor-league deal with the New York Mets in 2012. He never made it back to the majors before retiring in 2013. Nitkowski is still sure he'd used every last ounce of talent he had. He is one of only a handful of athletes who have gone public on the treatment. He understands why active players want to talk to him about it.

"I can't recommend it," Nitkowski said. "I can only tell my story." He feels that stem cell therapy could be used regularly "if they generate tissue" to help the body heal itself.

## The Big "If"

But that's a big "if," for professional athletes and the teams that pay them millions. Several years after Nitkowski's procedure, a lot of questions about stem cell therapy remain unanswered.

Why? Because studies don't show for sure what it can and can't do. This is why players and agents are paying so much attention to it.

"They want the cutting edge," said Dr. Jim Bradley, orthopedic surgeon for the NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers. "Anything that is cutting edge that can get their guys a couple more years in the league."

Bradley is confident of its potential. Still, he spends a lot of time explaining what exactly stem cell therapy does. Adult stem cells are similar cells found throughout the body that can divide rapidly and help repair tissue. The belief is that stem cells can serve as reinforcements to an injured muscle or joint.

However, no lab results prove it works for sure. Still, athletes are interested in the procedure.

"Everybody wants answers right now and you can't have them right now," Bradley said.

At least not in the United States, where medical regulation is more restrictive than elsewhere. To avoid scrutiny from the Food and Drug Administration, stem cell doctors generally perform one-day procedures similar to what Nitkowski received. That's not the case overseas.

## Stem Cell Therapy Abroad

Hospitals in various countries in Europe, Australia and Asia offer stronger therapies. Patients can have stem cells taken out and then grown in a laboratory for weeks, producing millions more cells.

Bradley believes many countries are ahead of the United States on stem cell therapy. He has told some of his patients to go to a clinic in the Cayman Islands he thinks is safe.

Athletes who go outside the U.S. for stem cell therapy generally do so quietly. News reports said football star Peyton Manning traveled to Germany in 2011 while recovering from neck surgery. Manning hasn't spoken publicly about the issue. Tennis star Rafael Nadal had stem cell treatment in 2014 to help his ailing back but hasn't recommended the procedure to others.

Pro teams in the United States can't stop players dealing with injuries from seeking as many opinions as they want. Yet not all teams are in favor of such treatments.

"If the player does something we're not recommending, it's more or less on them," Steelers general manager Kevin Colbert said. "We firmly recommend that you stay here."

## Early Days For Stem Cell Therapy

Research on stem cells remains in the early stages.

Dr. Freddie Fu, head physician for University of Pittsburgh athletics, is suspicious of the therapy. Fu has had stem cells in his lab for 15 years. He won't use them on humans because of uncertainty, including the unpredictability of what manipulated cells will do when they're introduced to a new area of the body.

"You can have one cell be Obi Wan Kenobi, the other is Darth Vader," Fu said. "You're not sure which way it's going to go."

Fu is all for progress. Yet for all of sports medicine's advances over the last 50 years, he says you can't escape the laws of nature.

"If you get hurt, it's going to take time to heal," Fu said. "It's a part of life. There's always a way to think that maybe something is better, but it might not be."
