WASHINGTON — The Whigs, the 19th century political party that disbanded before the Civil War over the question of slavery, is trying to make a comeback as the political center between embittered modern day Republicans and Democrats.

In Philadelphia, the election of Heshy Bucholz, a software engineer and the first candidate to run and win as a Whig in that city in 157 years, has brought national attention to the party. It also spurred hundreds of new members to sign up.

In Maryland, where the Whigs held four of their national conventions in the mid-19th century, the hub of the comeback is in Cecil County. Tim Zane, a registered Republican and a former vice president at a large international bank, is in talks to be in charge of the Maryland branch of the Modern Whig Party.

Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho and Virginia are likewise seeking new chapter leaders.

## Maryland Whig Opposes Tax Increases

There are about 200 members of the Modern Whig Party in Maryland, and another 200 support the group by receiving its newsletter. Maryland would benefit from a third party because of its problem with representation, Zane said. Democrats are in power there right now.

He says tax increases are evidence that a Democratic control of decision-making is bad for Maryland's citizens.

After a century and a half of dormancy, the Modern Whig Party was relaunched in 2007 by veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. It claims 30,000 members. Historically a party of compromise, the Whigs believe in mixing ideas from multiple viewpoints to arrive at the best solution.

Modern Whigs favor allowing issues to be decided at the state and local level, painting themselves as the party of logic, research and reason. The Whigs see themselves in strong opposition to the two main political parties, which brought about the recent government shutdown.

In Washington today, "one side shuts down so the other side doesn't talk," said Brendan Galligan, chairman of the New Jersey chapter of the Modern Whig Party. Galligan is a school board member in a town in New Jersey.

Galligan jumped into Whigism after he discovered the town's school budget had increased by nearly 30 percent in five years. He ran unopposed as an independent in 2012 and was elected to the school board at age 23. He works as an electrician in New York City.

"The old Whigs were about building the country. Now it's about helping us from falling apart," Galligan said.

## "We Are A Rebirth"

A historical comparison between the old and Modern Whig Party is difficult because the United States is dealing with a completely different set of issues, said William Anthony Hay, a professor of history at Mississippi State University. Hay wrote a book on 19th century Whigs.

"It is a rebellion against gridlock in Washington," Hay said.

But that doesn't mean the party will resonate today.

"I think if you ask people about the Whig tradition today, they'd think you were talking about a hairpiece," Hay said.

While they date back to 17th century Scotland, the American Whig Party was originally formed in 1833 to oppose what opponents saw as President Andrew Jackson's imperialist presidency and government expansion. The party split just before the Civil War. Whigs disagreed over how much power the government should have over states. They also disagreed over whether slavery should end.

As a moderate party that tried to appeal to as many people as possible, its lack of concrete ideology seemed to contribute to its breakup. Many northern Whigs went on to form the core of the Republican Party. Southern Whigs turned to the Democratic Party.

"The Whigs … can claim to be the first real party of the people," said Andrew Evans, national chairman of the Modern Whig Party, who counts Abraham Lincoln and John Locke among the party's notable members.

"We are very proud of our history. We are a rebirth," Evans said. "We're not trying to take everything back to the 19th century, that's crazy."

## Third Party As Mediator?

During the government shutdown in October, a Gallup poll found that 60 percent of Americans who were asked believed a third party was needed. Only 26 percent of those asked believed the two main parties adequately represent Americans.

"There's not a need for more parties. There's a need for Americans to have options that can really represent them," Evans said. "It's about competition, as well. The quality of the product improves, the price goes down. Things are supposed to be better. Politics is the same."

Interest in the Modern Whig Party coincides with public weariness over the gridlocked two-party system, Evans said. The party saw an uptick of new members during the recent government shutdown. Following the election of Bucholz to Judge of Elections in a section of Philadelphia, there were 2,500 new Whigs in two or three days.

Bucholz garnered national attention as a breakthrough candidate in a time of near-constant fighting between the two big political parties, and won by 36-24 votes. Evans was "a little surprised" by Bucholz's victory.

"Since we have two major parties here, I definitely think that a third party could mediate and move conversation," Bucholz said.

But even three parties might not be enough.

Galligan believes the U.S. should adopt a five-party system, with the Socialists and Democrats on the left, the Whigs in the center, and the Republicans and Libertarians to the right of the spectrum. Socialists want an even bigger role for the government than Democrats do. Libertarians support maximum freedom for individuals.

"I've seen 4-year-olds in a minivan act better" than politicians in Washington, Galligan said.
