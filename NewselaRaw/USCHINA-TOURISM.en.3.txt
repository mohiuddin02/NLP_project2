The bus brought a group of Chinese tourists to a California mall. Most hurried off to buy luggage that they planned to stuff with high-end clothes, shoes and bags.

But not Guoshing Cui, a Samsung supervisor from Guangzhou. He went straight to the Coach store and picked out three expensive handbags. He paid more than $800 from a wad of $100 bills.

The bags were gifts for family and friends in China. Coach goods sell there for two to three times the price in the United States. "It's a smart move," he said of his purchases.

Chinese tourists are the highest-spending visitors to the United States. Their shop-'til-you-drop habit makes them the customers that malls and tour bus operators want most.

Visitors from China spend about $3,000 per visit to California. That compares with $1,900 for other tourists from overseas, according to the government. About one-third of the spending is on gifts and souvenirs.

"They don't like to lay on the beaches," said Ernest Wooden Jr., president of the Los Angeles Tourism and Convention Board. "What they do like is shopping."

Foreign visitors to the United States spent more than ever in 2012, according to U.S. officials. That money from Chinese visitors helped set the new record of $168.1 billion.

## Strong Economy = Strong Shoppers

China has a strong economy and a growing middle class. This means more Chinese citizens have money to travel and to spend. The middle class in China numbered 247 million people in 2011. That is 18 percent of the population. It is projected to grow to more than 600 million by 2020.

Visitors to California from China usually have good jobs. They make $66,900 a year on average. That compares with an average income of about $5,000 for all Chinese residents.

Store owners in Southern California go out of their way to welcome Chinese tourists.

Some stores at a Desert Hills mall have salespeople who speak Mandarin, China's most-spoken language. One of the salesclerks is Jeffrey Hsu. He works at the Ugg Australia store.

"I think we understand their customs," Hsu said. "When someone comes to a foreign country, they want to bring back gifts for their family and friends."

Spending by Chinese travelers has grown fast. It now exceeds that of other high-spending visitors.

People from different countries have different spending patterns. Those patterns are shaped by conditions back home.

Australians have a culture similar to Americans. They are more likely than other travelers to visit museums and landmarks.

Japanese tourists spend a lot at restaurants because foods like red meat cost much more at home.

"Don't even put fish or chicken in front of them," Joanna Sanchez, a spokeswoman for Morton's steakhouse, said of Japanese visitors. "They come for steak."

The Chinese tourists tend not to shop for themselves. Most of their purchases are gifts for friends and family.

Chinese tourists in the United States usually buy expensive clothes and other things that they see in American movies and magazines. They look for brands such as Coach, Ugg, Polo, Nike, Tommy Hilfiger and Neiman Marcus. High Chinese taxes make these products two to three times more expensive in China, said Helen Koo of America Asia Tours.

"Many tourists feel that the savings more than pay for the entire trip," she said.

## Save On Hotels, Spend On Polos

Many Chinese visitors also stock up on vitamins in the United States. They don't trust the quality of vitamins sold back home.

Chinese tourists prefer shopping at outlet malls. This is a way to get more for their money. Outlet malls are located miles from major cities. The stores sell just one brand. They can offer products at lower prices than department stores that sell different brands of goods.

"We see many visitors head to the luggage store, get a suitcase" and then fill the bag, said Michele Rothstein of Simon Property Group. Simon owns many malls across the U.S.

Ding Sheng, a tourist from China, said he took a tour to Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. He was planning to see the casinos of Las Vegas and the Grand Canyon. But he said a shopping outing to the outlet mall was the highlight of the trip.

Chinese tourists may spend heavily on gifts and souvenirs. But the travelers typically cut back on food and lodging, tour guides say.

"Even when they stay at a cheap hotel, they spend a lot on shopping," said Nathan Xue, a tour guide.
