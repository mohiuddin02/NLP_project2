CHICAGO â€” Women have an important role in buying most of the cars in America. The majority of people working in the car industry, though, are men.

Fewer than 1 in 5 car engineers are women, according to Lindsay Brooke. She wrote the report "Women in Vehicle Engineering." Also, just one woman leads a major automobile company. Mary Barra was named head of General Motors in 2014.

## Cars Need To Change It Up

More than half of the women around the world are unhappy with the cars on the market, said Brandy Schaffels. The lack of women in the car industry may be the reason why. Schaffels is the chief editor of AskPatty.com. The website gives car advice to women. Scaffels discovered that women want more places to store things, and nicer lighting and materials. They also want cars designed for their smaller body size, she said.

There is a great need for car designers and engineers. It is especially important for more women to study engineering. They are needed to work on car design, lighting, technology and development, Brooke said.

Three female auto engineers are making a big difference in the car world. They are role models for young women interested in automobile engineering.

## Ford's Busy Engineer

The first is Dawn Piechocki. She is an engineering manager for the Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator at Ford Motor Company. She is involved in designing the cars' frames, engines and bodies.

She travels between two offices. One is in Dearborn, Michigan, the birthplace of the American car industry. The other is in Mexico City. In Mexico, she is the only woman in charge of engineering and she manages 55 people. "When I came here I was unsure about how I would be viewed," Piechocki said. She did not know whether the men would accept a woman as their boss. "I've been accepted very well," she said.

Piechocki also tests vehicles. She has driven cars in deserts around the world. She has also test-driven from Mexico City at 7,500 feet to Acapulco at sea level.

She speaks to younger women who are interested in science and math. "And I have found a lot of women, especially younger women, are just (scared) by vehicles," she said. "But I explain that the automotive field is huge." There are many areas where women can make a difference.

## Great Schooling Advice

The second car engineer is Elizabeth Krear. She works for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. She is chief engineer of the Ram 1500 truck.

"As an engineer, I can be a decision-maker," Krear said. She has a husband and two kids.

When she was thinking about what to study in college, her dad told her to be an engineer. "It was great advice," she said.

"Engineering training is basically problem solving," Krear said. She tells girls that if they are good at math and interested in how things work, "engineering is a great field."

## High-Tech Car Building

The third female engineer is Elizabeth Baron. She invented a new technology that uses virtual reality to design cars. It lets engineers figure out how a car works before it is even built. Last fall, she won Ford's highest technical award.

Baron works in fields where most of the people are men. She is the only woman on her team. "Thankfully we respect each other, and that's what is important."
