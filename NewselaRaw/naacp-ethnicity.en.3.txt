SEATTLE, Wash. â€” People across America are talking about Rachel Dolezal. She was a leader for a group in Spokane, Washington, that supports the rights of African-Americans. The group is called the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, or NAACP.

It works to make sure that all people are treated fairly, regardless of their race or skin color. Dolezal was the president of the Spokane NAACP.

Last week, it was revealed that Dolezal is not African-American. She is actually a white woman who was born to white parents. She has pretended to be African-American for many years. After the news came out, Dolezal quit.

Her story has created a national discussion about some of the most difficult issues in America today. The country is increasingly multicultural, with more people who come from two or more racial backgrounds, like white and black. People are talking about what it means for a person to say that he or she belongs to a certain race. And people are raising questions about whether it is OK for people to adopt, or take on, a different race from their own.

## People React With Anger, Sympathy

There are a lot of questions, but one thing is certain: The story of Rachel Dolezal has created a storm of anger and sympathy across the country.

After she quit, Dolezal posted an explanation on the Facebook page of the Spokane NAACP chapter.

She spoke about the fight that lies ahead for the rights of African-Americans. She did not address the claims that she lied about her race, and she did not apologize.

Baz Dreisinger is the author of the book "Near Black: White-to-Black Passing in American Culture." Many people are willing to think openly about race, she said. Still, many people are stuck thinking that "black is black and white is white." When a situation like this comes up, "it's a shocker," Dreisinger said.

Dolezal has been praised for making the 106-year-old NAACP chapter in Spokane more active and helping African-Americans in her community. Still, some events in her life have seem to go against her cause of helping black Americans. When she was a student at Howard University, she sued the school. Howard University is a historically black college.

Dolezal filed a legal complaint against the school. She said she was treated unfairly because she was white. She said that the university removed her artwork from a student presentation because it favored African-American students over her.

The court closed the issue because it didn't think Dolezal's complaint was serious enough.

## She Avoided Question About Her Race

Dolezal recently walked away from a TV reporter who asked her about her race. The reporter showed Dolezal a photograph of an elderly black man and asked whether it was her father. "Yes, that's my dad," she replied. Then, Dolezal was asked whether she is African-American. Dolezal replied, "I don't understand the question," and walked away.

Dolezal's mother and father have adopted three African-American children and one Haitian child. They say she has pretended to be black even though both of her parents were white.

"We hope that Rachel will get the help she needs to deal with her identity issues," her mother, Ruthanne Dolezal, said on NBC's "Today" show Monday morning.

"We taught our children, as we raised all six of them: Tell the truth; always be honest. So we weren't going to lie; we told the truth: Rachel is our birth daughter," her father, Lawrence Dolezal, said on the show.

## Group Disappointed, National Leader Says

The NAACP national president, Cornell William Brooks, spoke in an interview on Monday with the Times. Dolezal was widely respected in Spokane, he said. There is "a great deal of disappointment and pain now."

Brooks also said that being black is not a requirement for membership within the NAACP.

What is important is telling the truth, he said. "Lying is not (part of) our values."

Ed Prince is in charge of another Washington group that supports African-Americans. He said the anger toward Dolezal "goes to the heart of white privilege."

"An African-American can never wake up and say, 'I'm gonna make my hair blond, put on white makeup and go through my day as a white person,'" Prince said.
