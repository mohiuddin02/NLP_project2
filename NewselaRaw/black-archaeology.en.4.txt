BALTIMORE â€” In Easton, Maryland, African-American history is being dug right out of the ground. Before the Civil War, most black people were slaves. They were forced to work on plantations and held as the property of white people.

But in Easton, there was a group of African-Americans who escaped slavery or had bought their freedom. Experts are now looking at how these free black people lived.

Archaeologists and historians are digging up a place called The Hill. They are finding glass, pottery and oyster shells which will tell them about the past. They think The Hill is the earliest example of free African-Americans living together in the United States. The settlement dates back to 1790.

Dale Green is a professor at Morgan State University. He said this project is not just a story about black people. It's a story about America.

## Digging Deeper Into History

The Hill was founded by freed slaves. Some slaves were able to buy their own freedom. Others were freed by religious groups. In communities like The Hill, black people were able to own property and trade goods.

In 1790 around 410 free African-Americans lived on The Hill, according to a population count called a census. Only 250 free African-Americans lived in the port city of Baltimore at the time.

Researchers and students are in the middle of a three-week dig in Easton. They are working in 5-by-5-foot squares. The deeper they dig, the further back in history they go.

At first, the team found 20th-century objects such as toy marbles. Then they discovered older things from the 19th century.

Stefan Woehlke is in charge of the dig. He showed off a green glass bottle with a design of grapes on the side. Woehlke said it was made in the late 18th or early 19th century. It probably held wine. The diggers also found a 1-cent coin with Lady Liberty, dated 1794.

Professor Green said that black and white families lived together at The Hill. The property belonged to James Price, a white man, in 1790. Records show that Price and three free African-Americans lived there. The records don't include very much information about the African-Americans.

## Just Scratching The Surface

The work at The Hill promises to give up lots of new information. But the researchers say they're only scratching the surface.

"It's sort of piecing together a puzzle, but you don't have all the pieces," Woehlke said. The group will work at Easton for five more years.

Since the dig began, more than 500 people have visited The Hill. Some visitors have been on organized tours. But others have just wandered in after seeing signs posted around the block.

Priscilla Morris has family roots in Easton. Her relatives lived in the area in the 1600s. Morris said she finds the dig "thrilling."

Professor Green said the work at The Hill could change the way American history is told. At the moment, the story of free blacks is usually ignored. In the past, history was always told by the slave owners rather than the African-Americans.

There are plans to get the word out about The Hill. Students are working on essays about the place. Museums plan to set up exhibits. There might even be a movie made about the community at Easton.

The Hill is already part of the National Register of Historic Places. That information will soon be updated to include the black history of the area.

## In The Middle Of Town

About 75 researchers and students are working on the project. Tracy Jenkins is an archaeology student at the University of Maryland. He said that people in Easton have been very interested in the dig. They have also been friendly to the archaeologists.

Jenkins enjoys this as it doesn't often happen in archaeology. He said that he sometimes has to dig in lonely places in the countryside. There are no other people around to take an interest in his work.

But The Hill is in the middle of town. So the researchers and local people are getting to know each other. Jenkins is excited about working on the project. He wants to write a paper that he says really matters, and not something that just "sits on the shelf."

He said, "I like the opportunity to tell stories that haven't been told."
