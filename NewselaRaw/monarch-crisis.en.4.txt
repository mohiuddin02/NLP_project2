They travel to Mexico to spend the winter there. But their journey is in danger.

The number of these monarch butterflies is falling. There are many reasons why. Farmers are using more weed killer. Also, the weather has been severe. And more and more forests are being cut down.

The monarch butterfly colonies in Mexico were much smaller this year than ever before. Scientists say these butterfly groups may soon disappear. The orange-and-black butterfly is a popular insect that most school kids can easily recognize.

Scientists say there are many reasons for the drop in the number of monarch butterflies. But they are focusing on one main reason: The butterflies can't live without a plant called milkweed.

## Big Drop In Milkweed

Female monarchs lay eggs on milkweed. When they hatch, the larvae grow into caterpillars that eat the milkweed's leaves. Those leaves contain a poison that protects the monarchs from their predators. The caterpillars then form chrysalises and soon emerge as butterflies.

But the milkweed plant is widely treated as a weed to be destroyed.

The number of fields that have milkweed in them has dropped in the past 10 years. Corn and soybean crops have been changed and weed killer can't hurt them. So farmers can now use a stronger weed killer. That makes it harder for milkweed to grow in the fields.

Most monarch butterflies live only a little more than a month. But some live for seven or eight months. That is long enough to fly to Mexico for the winter. In Mexico, the butterflies often stay in the same trees that their parents or grandparents did.

The butterflies fly back north in the spring. There, they lay eggs on milkweed and then die, making way for the next generation.

## What Does It Mean?

Scientists worry what the drop in the number of butterflies means. What will happen to other insects and birds that live in the same areas?

The drop in the butterflies also affects people's lives in central Mexico. Tourists travel to Mexico on vacation to see the butterflies. That creates jobs for Mexicans who work in hotels, restaurants and as tour guides. Those jobs help them take care of their families.

But fewer butterflies means fewer visitors.

Fernando Guzman Cruz is part of a group that looks after the butterflies in Mexico. Only about half the number of visitors came to see the butterflies this year than last year, he said. He blames the drop on farmers in the U.S.

"We want you to stop killing the milkweed," he said to a U.S. visitor.
