LOS ANGELES â€” Across the country, college students are doing lab experiments. Some students at Cal State are breeding fruit flies. Others are watching the heart beats of people on a treadmill. But they are doing it from their computers.

More and more, students are doing lab work online.

The online experiments are done instead of hands-on lab work. Virtual labs are now used in nearly every type of science. They save colleges money. Some colleges have too many students and not enough labs. Virtual labs let more students take classes.

Some scientists are not happy. They say students need to learn traditional lab work. In a traditional lab, the student can touch what they work on. These scientists say it teaches practical skills. They think it helps students to do more advanced work.

## Not Enough Science Labs

People who support virtual labs say they don't want to get rid of real labs. They say virtual labs can be a useful tool. It can be used for beginner's science courses.

California State University plans to use many more virtual labs for its easiest science courses. The courses are mostly for non-science students. Often, college students have to take science classes even if they don't want a job in science.

Cal State does not have enough science labs. At the same time, the number of students is growing rapidly.

As a result, students can't get spots in the lab classes. Students have to wait to take classes. Some do not finish their studies on time.

Cal State officials want to make it easier for students to take lab courses. They hope the changes will help people like Gerrymi Bernardo. He is a design student in his last year. Bernardo wanted to take the lab course earlier, but couldn't get a spot.

"It's really convenient being able to do this at home on my own time," said Bernardo. He has a job to pay for college. Online lab courses fit his schedule.

Stephanie Ugalde felt differently. She studies food science. Ugalde said the virtual lab made her "disappointed not to be dissecting stuff."

In a lab at Cal State Los Angeles, students recently did a group exercise online. They designed experiments on animals in nature. The program let them change what animals looked like. They could also add predators and change the surroundings. The program gave instant results for the different designs.

Computer simulations are now used for many types of science. For example, they are often used to study earthquakes.

Some people worry that colleges are too quick to use online classes. They say it is not sure that online courses work.

Paulo Blikstein runs a lab at Stanford University. It mixes traditional labs with virtual labs.

In his lab, students use a robot. It can be controlled by a cellphone or computer. Students can send a command from anywhere. They can tell the robot to add a chemical to a petri dish. Then they can take a video of what happens.

Blikstein says virtual labs alone can be too simple. "And then students understand it's not really happening, but just a simulation," Blikstein said. "We're finding that affects their motivation."
