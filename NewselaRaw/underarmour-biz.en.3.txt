BALTIMORE, Md. — Under Armour is hoping to gain loyal customers by telling stories about sports. The tales connect famous athletes to shoes and clothes.  

The sporting goods company hopes the stories will make people want to buy its products. Under Armour is in Baltimore. The city is in the state of Maryland.

"We always strive to tell a story," said Adam Clement, who works for Under Armour.

To strive is to try really hard.   

## The Cheetah And The Camaro

For example, two years ago, Under Armour created clothing for an American running star. Her name is Natasha Hastings.

"The cheetah is her favorite animal since it's the fastest animal," Clement said. "We placed the cheetah on the back so all those behind her would know the race leader couldn't be caught."

Another story is that of Bryce Harper. He plays Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Washington Nationals. The team plays in Washington, D.C. The MLB is a baseball league made up of 30 teams in North America. 

Next season, Under Armour says that Harper will begin wearing a black baseball shoe. It will be connected to the story of his favorite car, a black Chevrolet Camaro. 

Harper is from the state of Nevada. He wore gold shoes during the 2013 Home Run Derby, an MLB hitting contest. The shoes represented Las Vegas, a city in Nevada. 

## An Underdog's Sweet And Sour Favorites

Basketball player Stephen Curry also has a story. He was the Most Valuable Player in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for 2015. The NBA is a basketball league made up of 30 teams in North America.

Curry feels a strong connection with his church, so two different shoes designed for him display his favorite Bible verses.

He is also known for his love of Sour Patch Kids candy. Under Armour designed a shoe that is bright yellow, green and red - the same colors as the candy. It is called "Candy Reign" to recognize how much Curry loves sour candy. To reign means to rule over something.

The basketball star's popularity has been good for Under Armour. The company markets him as an underdog. An underdog is a person who is expected to lose in a contest. Curry was not picked by many college basketball teams because he is small, but now he is famous.

Under Armour often sells itself as an underdog, too. Its closest competitor is Nike, which also sells sporting goods. Nike sells more clothing and footwear, but Under Armour is growing fast. 

Nike also sells its products and sportswear using athletes' stories. The two companies compete. They are both trying to sell clothing and shoes, get famous athletes to wear their company's gear, and use inspiring stories.

## Fans, Critics And Flags

George Kiel writes a blog about sneakers called NiceKicks.com. A blog is an online column on a website about things that a writer has seen, experienced or has an opinion about. Kiel says Under Armour goes deeper into the story than other brands.

Not everybody likes Under Armour's designs. Earlier this year, one sports website said, "Under Armour is trying way too hard to be cool." 

Four years ago, Under Armour designed new uniforms based on the colors of the Maryland state flag. The uniforms were for a college football team called the Maryland Terrapins. When players showed off their new uniforms, NBA basketball star LeBron James posted his comment on Twitter: "Ewwwww." 

Under Armour executives say athletes and fans should feel connected to their products. For example, the company created uniforms for the U.S. Naval Academy's men's basketball team. The Naval Academy is a college for officers in the United States Navy, a branch of the military that works at sea. The logo shows a snake above red and white stripes. It is inspired by the U.S. Navy flag. The flag is meant to symbolize the American fight for freedom.
