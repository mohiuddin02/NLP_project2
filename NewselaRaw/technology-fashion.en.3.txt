Technology is increasingly becoming something you can wear. There are music players that match the tunes to your heart beat. Some sweaters can change color depending on how you feel.

There are even fitness bracelets and necklaces to track your calorie burning.

Chaotic Moon Studios in Austin, Texas, is a mobile software company that is trying to come up with new "wearable tech." It's working on a product to compete with Google's upcoming eyewear that can log onto the Internet. It is also designing other wearable projects for several other customers.

Chaotic Moon co-founder William "Whurley" Hurley said wearable technology will be big business.

## The Next Big Thing?

"It's just like when the iPhone came out and there was this mad gold rush. It's gonna be the same thing," Hurley said.

Mutual Mobile, also in Austin, is working on Google Glass programs for a variety of customers. Google Glass is the name of Google's eyewear. Doctors might use the glasses to pull up patient information. Warehouse employees could use them to scan codes on packages.

"People are starting to get into it," said Sam Gaddis, a company officer.

The devices depend on sensors that can measure all kinds of information. Gaddis says those sensors are becoming cheap. That helps more people develop the devices.

Mutual Mobile has hosted events to encourage its developers to see what they can invent.

After one, its developers created a football with a sensor that can measure the quality of the throw. They also made a boxing game. It measures how often you've hit the target.

Experts say that wearables are the next big thing in tech.

## Putting Money Into Wearables

"I think we're going to see some very, very big leaps in just the next year," businessman Manish Chandra said. He was at a wearable technology conference and fashion show in San Francisco. Hundreds of developers, engineers and designers were there.

Google Glass and rumors of Apple's iWatch are popularizing the wearable technology field. Analysts forecast swift growth. Last year the market for wearable technology totaled almost $9 billion. That should climb to $30 billion by 2018, said analyst Shane Walker. Wearable technology includes everything from hearing aids to wristband pedometers.

Hurley credits Google's public relations campaign for its glasses. That made investors put money into wearables.

Gaming will also be affected. Look at products like the Oculus Rift, a virtual reality headset that enables 3-D gaming. Virtual reality technology makes you feel like you are in the middle of an artificial world.

Robin Arnott created a program for the Rift. He showed it off at a recent conference. Users strap on the headset. Then the program uses their vocal tones to display a series of tunnelling images, creating fantastical visual effects.

Devices like Google's glasses put the Internet on top of the real world. Arnott describes them as "augmented reality."

Wearables "extend your abilities as a human, just as your phone does," he said.

## You May Be Assimilated

Humans will need to adapt to the technology, said Georgia Institute of Technology professor Thad Starner. He advises Google on its glasses.

The glasses are lightweight frames equipped with a hidden camera and a tiny display that responds to voice commands.

The devices will cause a huge change, said Starner, eventually offering "capabilities that people haven't thought of before."

Wearable computers are designed to be in the background, he said.

When the technology is closer to the body, you notice it less, he added. "It's more an extension of yourself," he said.

But there are sure to be issues. Google Glass and some competitors have raised concerns of people who don't want to be secretly videoed or photographed.

## Not Everyone's A Fan

Some people do not like the idea of the new technology.

In a newly released survey, 42 percent of workers said they would not be willing to strap on wearable tech for their jobs. Older and more traditional employees were less willing than their younger counterparts. The survey by Cornerstone OnDemand polled 1,029 Americans aged 18 and over in August.

Then there's an issue of bandwidth, said Ritch Blasi, who researches the wearable technology market. Right now, there simply isn't enough network service to support constant wireless use everywhere, he said. But that, too, will catch up.

"It almost makes you think everyone is going to turn into a cyborg," he said, referring to a fictional, high tech comic book superhero.

And will they? "When you look at the world and everything people are doing?" Blasi said. "I think the answer to that is yes."
