Scientists have bad news for young dancers. They are not getting as much exercise as they might think.

A new study reports that fewer than 1 in 10 kids are getting enough exercise in their dance classes. For teens who dance, the numbers are even worse.

The study about dance and exercise was put together by scientists from San Diego State University and the University of California, San Diego. More than 250 young dancers helped with their project.

## Dance Flunks Daily 30-Minute Goal

Girls wore special belts while they were dancing. They took classes like ballet, jazz and hip-hop. The belts recorded how much time the girls spent in motion and how quickly they were moving.

Government health officials say students should get 30 minutes of exercise during each school day. They also encourage students to do another 30 minutes of exercise after school.

Scientists studied seven different types of dance for their report. None of them kept the dancers working long enough to meet the 30-minute goal.

## Hip-Hop Dance Classes Earn Top Score

Some dance classes were better than others. Some kids ages 5 to 10 took a Spanish dance class that lasted almost an hour. They only spent six minutes of the class really dancing fast enough to count as exercise.

Dancers in the ballet class got 14 minutes of exercise. Students who did partner dances like ballroom and swing dancing got 22 minutes of exercise per class.

Hip-hop classes scored the highest. Dancers did 27 minutes of hard work in those classes.

For older dancers, the results were not much different. Students ages 11 to 18 danced for about 17 minutes of their ballet classes and 16 minutes of each hip- hop class. Spanish dancing came in last again. Dancers in that class got only about four minutes of real exercise per class.

## Teen Dancers Get Less Exercise Than Kids

None of the teen dance classes met the 30-minute goal. The students were in the classes for much longer than 30 minutes, but they did not have to push themselves that whole time.

The study also showed that most teenage dancers are getting less exercise than the 5- to 10-year-old group. Scientists were surprised about that. Older students usually go to longer, more advanced classes. That gives them better opportunities to get exercise.

The scientists tried to find a reason why older dancers would be dancing less than the kids group. Teens have longer, harder dance routines. Maybe they had to stand around while they were learning the moves. The younger students might just be moving around more. Maybe they are not standing still in line while waiting for their turn.

## Team Sports Give Kids A Better Workout

When the study was finished, the scientists took a good look at the results. They decided that team sports gave kids much more exercise than dance classes.

Scientists agree that there is a lot of standing around no matter which one kids choose, but playing sports offers something extra. It pushes kids harder.

For example, dancers wind up standing around for about a third of each class. Soccer players stand still just as much, but when they are moving, it is faster and harder. Soccer players spend another third of each practice working up a sweat and giving it their all.

Doctors say that is the type of exercise that keeps kids from becoming overweight. Dancers hardly ever have to move that way.

Dance can be difficult, but it is challenging in a different way. It is fun to do and fun to watch, but it just does not offer the same health benefits as sports.
