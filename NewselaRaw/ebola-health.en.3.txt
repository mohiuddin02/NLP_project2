ATLANTA â€” Ebola is a deadly virus. It kills six to nine of every 10 people who become infected with it. Right now, there is a big Ebola outbreak in Africa.

International health officials warned Friday that the virus was moving faster than they could control it. Meanwhile, U.S. doctors prepared for the arrival of two Americans infected with the disease.

The two Americans were being moved from Liberia to Atlanta, according to the Christian aid group Samaritan's Purse.

They are Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol. They are currently in serious condition, the group said.

On Saturday, Brantly arrived in Atlanta first. He was taken to Emory University Hospital where there is a special isolation unit. The unit was built in cooperation with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC's job is to protect the nation's health.

The unit at Emory is one of only four of its kind in the nation. It separates infected patients from other areas of the hospital.

## Fighting A Disease That Has No Cure

Meanwhile, Dr. Margaret Chan, head of the World Health Organization, spoke about fighting the disease in Africa. She said that the international group planned to release $100 million to fight the disease. More than 1,300 people have been infected with the virus and 729 have died.

"This outbreak is moving faster than our efforts to control it," she said Friday at a meeting in Guinea. If things get worse, there could be a greater number of lives lost and the disease could spread to other countries, she said. The disease could also cost those countries a great deal of money.

There is no vaccine or one clear-cut treatment for Ebola. It is spread through direct contact with the organs, blood or other fluids of infected people.

People who are infected with the virus experience sudden fever, intense weakness, muscle pain and headaches. They also throw up and have diarrhea. The disease can cause kidney and liver failure, as well as bleeding inside the body.

## Ebola Scares Many People

Word that two infected patients were being transported to the United States for medical care has scared some people. They worry that the disease could begin to spread here. However, Dr. Anthony Fauci insisted that this was highly unlikely. He is a top doctor working for the government.

Dr. Fauci talked about the strength of the U.S. health care system. He said that doctors here could keep infected people away from other people.

Still, some people near Emory University Hospital said they were worried. They did not like the idea of Ebola patients being treated in their hometown.

"What? No, that worries me," Lisa Jackson said while sitting at a nearby bus stop. "Why are they bringing them here? They shouldn't even let them across the border," she said.

Alexis Walker praised Emory and the CDC for the transfer. "It's good to know when someone needs help and medical care, there's someplace they can go," Walker said.

As Walker spoke, a woman drove by the hospital. She was wearing a mask over her face. Walker said it was those kinds of sights, and Internet postings warning of a deadly virus reaching American shores, that gave people the wrong idea about the situation. "What they're doing is making people afraid," she said.

## Travel Warnings For Extra Safety

On Thursday, the CDC warned against travel to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. All three countries are in West Africa.

"We do not have effective treatment or vaccine for Ebola," said Dr. Tom Frieden, head of the CDC. "There is no proven treatment. There is no proven vaccine. There is not likely to be one for at least a year."

He said health officials would control the disease using ways that have worked before. They include identifying people who are infected, separating them from other people and finding people they have been close to. Health care workers must communicate with each other, he said.

Writebol reportedly received an "experimental" drug. There was only enough of the drug for one person. Brantly reportedly received a "unit of blood" from a 14-year-old boy who survived the disease. The boy's family wanted to thank the doctor for saving his life.
