WASHINGTON â€” A minor plan to change what food labels say about sugar has stirred up a big food fight.

The objections have not just come from candy companies and soft-drink makers.

The governor of Massachusetts asked the Obama administration to rethink its proposal. The governor of Wisconsin has protested too. So did the government of Australia, which warned the move could break international agreements.

## Sugar TMI

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is in charge of food safety, is considering the new labels. It would add a line to labels on packaged food products. The new information would say how many teaspoons of sugar had been added.

The reaction of the food industry reveals the extent to which extra sugar is added into even the most unlikely foods. It also shows how worried food makers are that consumers will find out. The FDA has received 287,889 public comments on the plan. Many of them are from major food companies and trade groups.

Supporters say the strong reaction shows just how worried the food industry is over new labeling.

"They know this will impact how people choose their products, and that terrifies them," said Renee Sharp. She is the director of research for the Environmental Working Group, one of several groups working to get the added sugar on the labels.

But food industry officials say the proposal is unnecessary. Current labels give the total amount of sugar in a product. The number combines the sugars that occur naturally in a food and what is added while it is made. Sugar is sugar, and no evidence justifies singling out one type of it, industry officials say.

## Companies Strongly Object

Andrew Briscoe is the president of the Sugar Association. He wrote that science does not justify the added-sugar labeling. He said it sets an alarming example.

For the government, too, the issue has become very important. Healthy eating is very important for President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, who announced the sugar labeling plan last year.

Many different food makers oppose the label change, not just candy companies.

The loudest alarm is being sounded by the cranberry industry. Over the summer, it received the support of Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin and then-Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick. The governors wrote to the FDA that forcing food makers to say how much sugar they add to cranberry products would be unfair. Unlike other fruits, cranberries are so bitter that they would taste terrible without added sugar.

The Campbell Soup Company made a different kind of argument. It said that revealing how much sugar it adds to soup could help make Americans fatter.

"Such information could confuse consumers by taking their focus off of calories," it wrote to the agency.

Another of the dozens of companies calling on the FDA to cancel the sugar labeling plan is the Roman Meal Company, which makes whole-grain breads. The American Nutrition Society also joined the fight. Its members include Kellogg Company, Coca-Cola and Dannon, the yogurt maker.

## Secret Sugars

Supporters say that unhealthy amounts of sugar are secretly added to foods.

"That one line on a label seems like a small thing," said Deborah Bailin of the Union of Concerned Scientists. "But not having it covers up a very big fact that the food industry does not want people to know."

She added, "Things they want you to think are healthy are full of sugar."

When the Environmental Working Group studied 80,000 food products, it found that 58 percent had extra sugar added. That included most deli meats on supermarket shelves.

"I was shocked," Sharp said. "I mean, it's turkey. Why is there sugar in it?"

## Slippery Sugar Slope

The FDA says it only wants to let people know what they are eating. Healthy food groups, however, want companies to lower the amount of sugar they put into products. Their hope is that once people know how much sugar is in a product, they will stop buying it.

Opponents warn of a slippery slope that starts with sugar but does not end there. Other ingredients could be targeted, they say.

Baylen Linnekin is the executive director of the Keep Food Legal Foundation. The group supports the right of people to produce and eat what they want and is against the added-sugar label rule. "By forcing what amounts to an added-sugar warning on the label, the government is attempting" to tell people what to buy.

He warned of what could come next.

"Look at trans fats," he said. Trans fats can increase the risk of heart attacks. "First there was a requirement they be labeled. Now the FDA is moving to ban them."
