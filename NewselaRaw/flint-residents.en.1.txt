FLINT, Mich. — Ariana Hawk heated a bowl of distilled water in the microwave, dipped a washcloth in it and wiped her 2-year-old son's itchy, irritated skin.

She said she has been cleaning Sincere Smith's body this way — or with wet wipes — since last summer. The boy's doctor doesn't want him bathing in the tap water at their Flint home.

"I can't afford to go buy 20 gallons of water just to bathe him one time," said Hawk, a single mother of three.

Sincere has rough patches on his legs, arms and face, she explained. His skin condition started with a rash on his stomach after Flint switched its water supply source from Lake Huron to the more polluted Flint River in April 2014.

Hawk blames the water for the child's suffering and plans to sue.

"We get treated like … we don't matter," she said. "That's how it's been feeling."

## Pets And Plants Affected Too

Residents across Flint echo her frustration. Some of them stopped using the water immediately after the cost-saving change because of its smell, color, taste and source, while others continued to drink and cook with it.

People, pets, even plants have been affected by the poisonous water, which is contaminated with lead, they said.

Community members feel betrayed, worried, angry, sad and stressed. They are bracing for what will happen next in Flint, a city with 99,000 residents, 40 percent of whom live in poverty.

The city has seen a spike in the levels of lead in children's blood. Lead poisoning, experts say, affects intelligence and can have a lifelong impact, causing learning disabilities, speech and language problems, as well as an increased risk for behavioral problems.

Kids absorb lead more easily and have been exposed to lead if they drank Flint water since April 2014, health officials said.

## Lead Levels Have Spiked In Children

Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, a pediatrician at Flint's Hurley Children's Hospital, found a dangerous spike in children's blood lead levels. She said there is a lag period between lead exposure and symptoms, which can appear three to five years down the road.

To limit the impact of lead-poisoning in children, she suggested better nutrition, health care and early education programs.

Pamela Battle, a Flint resident with seven children ranging in age from 1 to 16, said she got a water filter Monday. Before that, she was using water from her faucet to cook and put it in bottles for her two youngest children.

"We were drinking it regularly," said Battle. "The whole family. Everyone here."

At the urging of her mother, Battle went to Freeman Elementary School last Tuesday with some of her kids to get their blood checked for lead. The school hosted an event where she learned about lead poisoning and its effects on children.

"I'm really concerned now," she said.

"I love my kids," Battle said. "I want them to grow up like I grew up" with no worries about water.

She said she has no choice but to stay in Flint with her children and live with the water crisis, but others have had enough and plan to leave.

## Governor Says More, Faster Help Needed

Kerry Wheeler said she, her 11-year-old daughter and their dog are moving to another town to escape the water situation.

Water in her home has varied from clear or cloudy to brown or yellow. At times, it has been so discolored that she refused to let her daughter bathe in it, she said.

Michigan Governor Rick Snyder declared a state of emergency Jan. 5 and acknowledged that actions taken by the state have not been good enough. He said that "more work needs to be done with more urgency."

State efforts were raised this week to get free bottled water, filtering supplies and water-testing kits to Flint residents. Members of the Michigan National Guard have been sent to Flint, and Snyder requested federal help for the water crisis.

On Saturday, President Barack Obama declared a federal emergency in Flint and ordered federal aid to help.

## Free Water, Filters Handed Out

Throughout last week, people lined up to pick up free water and filters at fire stations. More free supplies have been passed out door-to-door by Michigan State Police troopers, volunteers and others.

Flint Mayor Karen Weaver said Thursday night that the city has made progress but needs more people to help.

The city changed its source of water back to Lake Huron in October, but concerns about contamination remain because the water from the Flint River damaged pipes. Dan Wyant, the former head of the state Department of Environmental Quality, resigned last month. The agency failed to require the addition of anticorrosive chemicals to the water that would have protected the pipes.

## Public Trust Is Gone

Snyder has repeatedly apologized for the state's role in the water crisis, but many say he still hasn't done enough.

"That apology ain't going to help these kids," said Hawk, who said she doesn't know what dangers her children may face because of their exposure to lead. "That apology's not going to help the families that's suffering."

Weaver said that public trust has been shattered, and the solution is to fix the infrastructure and provide long-term help for Flint residents.

"We didn't deserve to be in this position, in this situation," she said, "and what happened here in Flint should never happen to any community."
