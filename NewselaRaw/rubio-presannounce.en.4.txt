MIAMI â€” Who will be the next president of the United States?

It may seem a little soon to be asking that question. President Obama will be in office for almost two more years. Americans won't vote for the next president until November 2016.

Still, the race to become the next president has already started. A few men and women have already announced that they will run. On Monday, Marco Rubio joined them.

Marco Rubio is a young lawmaker from Florida. Even though he is only 43 years old, he is already well-known.

On Monday, Rubio promised that he would make big changes as president. He presented himself as someone new.

## Not Like Clinton

Rubio's announcement came just one day after Hillary Rodham Clinton announced that she is running for president. Clinton used to be a lawmaker as well. She also worked at the White House with President Obama.

Clinton is running as a Democrat, while Rubio is running as a Republican. Each party will elect a single candidate. The winners from each party will face off in 2016.

In his speech, Rubio hinted that he was different from Clinton. She has been in government for many years. Rubio is a newcomer. He thinks voters who are unhappy with the government may vote for someone with a new approach.

## Not Like Bush Either

Rubio also made himself seem different from Jeb Bush. Bush may also run for president in 2016.

Both Clinton and Bush are linked to past presidents. Clinton's husband Bill was the 42nd president. Bush's father was the 41st president and his brother was the 43rd president.

With their family ties, Clinton and Bush are linked to old ways of doing things in government. Rubio argued that he is different.

He said that many of America's leaders are "stuck" in the past. He argued that America should find new ways of succeeding.

"Just yesterday, we heard from a leader from yesterday who wants to take us back to yesterday," he said. He was talking about Clinton.

Many of Rubio's supporters were at the announcement. They began lining up in 87-degree heat three hours before the event.

Fifty-year-old Kelly Steele and her 18-year-old son were among them. They wore Rubio T-shirts.

"We have had a lot of Bushes," Kelly Steele said. She felt that Rubio would bring change.

## A Long Road To Become President

Democrats don't support Rubio, of course. Before the announcement, Democratic lawmaker Debbie Wasserman Schultz criticized him. She argued that he would not bring the change he was promising. Instead, he would lead the country in the same old ways.

Rubio faces a long road to becoming president. Clinton could be difficult to beat. If Bush enters the race, he may be a tough challenger as well. Both can raise a lot of money because they come from famous families.

A few others have announced already that they are running for president. Lawmaker Ted Cruz of Texas made his announcement three weeks ago. Rand Paul of Kentucky announced he was running last week. They are Reublicans.

Both Cruz and Rubio are Hispanic. If one of them is elected, he will make history as the nation's first Hispanic president.
