PHILADELPHIA â€” Many parents occasionally yell at their children or grab them too roughly.

This goes for rich parents, as well as poor ones. But parents who live in poverty treat their children harshly more often, researchers say. And their kids suffer from it in ways science is just beginning to understand.

Harsh parenting, as it is called, is not child abuse. But it causes tremendous fear and worry in children, researchers say. This fear and worry, known as toxic stress, may change the way kids' brains work. It can increase the chance of bad behavior and cause health problems.

"This is an incredibly important public health issue," said Joan Luby. She is a professor in St. Louis who has studied 145 children over 12 years. She recently wrote an article about the effect of poverty on children's brains.

## Hurting A Child's Brain

Harsh parenting is as dangerous as lead poisoning, said Daniel Taylor. He is a doctor in North Philadelphia. Lead is a poisonous metal that can harm a child's brain.

Harsh parenting often involves "quick 'do-as-I-say' orders from Mom or Dad," Taylor said. A loving relationship helps to shield children from toxic stress, even when their parents yell. When parents are too consistently harsh, their children's brains release stress chemicals. Usually, these chemicals are released when a person is in danger. These chemicals are toxic, or poisonous, to developing brains.

They can harm the part of the brain that manages feelings. The child becomes overactive and may get into fights. He also may have trouble paying attention and be unable to calm his body down, Taylor said.

These poisonous stress chemicals also damage the part of the brain that affects memory, he said. Children may have trouble remembering things. It reduces their ability to read and do well on tests.

If toxic chemicals are released constantly, children will be more likely to develop heart disease, said Marcy Witherspoon. She is an expert on how children's brains develop.

Rich people, as well as poor ones, can be harsh parents. But low-income parents often struggle with things like hunger, the lack of a job and unsafe housing. These pressures can make them less patient and quick to anger. Taylor says poor neighborhoods hold generations of families suffering from harsh parenting.

"If a child's developing brain was being damaged by high lead levels, landlords would be sued, houses repaired," Taylor said. House paint used to be made with lead. It can get in kids' bodies.

Taylor considers child poverty a poison also.

## Won't Be Harsh To His Kids

Dave recently participated in a parenting workshop run by Witherspoon. He grew up poor. His mother constantly yelled at him. She told him he was worthless. This caused him toxic stress.

Now he is a single father who lives with his two young children.

"There are only two ways you come out of a situation like mine," Dave said. "You're either a victim and let the bad experiences control you, or you become better in spite of it."

He has tried to prevent passing on toxic stress to his kids.

Dave said he is proud that even if he is angry with his children, he doesn't embarrass them.

"I don't say they're bad, only that they're doing something bad. I control myself," Dave said.

## You Can Heal From Toxic Stress

Not all poor children suffer from toxic stress.

Some low-income parents do a good job of protecting their children's brains. They do this by paying attention to them and being involved in their kids' lives, said Maria McColgan. She is the director of a child protection program.

But even parents who don't treat their kids harshly can do damage. A poor mother distracted by lack of food may not be able to connect with her children. This emotional neglect can also cause toxic stress, said Bruce McEwen. He is a scientist in New York.

There is some good news: You can heal from toxic stress, said Witherspoon. She is the expert on brain development.

All it takes is for one adult to watch out for a child and believe in him, she said. That gives the child hope for the future.

Witherspoon helps parents understand how they create toxic stress in their children. The parents were victims of it. And they treat their children as their parents treated them. Knowing that can stop the cycle.

Parents need caring and support, said Witherspoon. Then they stop taking their worries out on their kids.

"To help," Witherspoon said, "I say to parents, 'Life sounds really hard. Tell me about it.'"
