Can't make it to Brazil for the 2014 World Cup? Maybe you can watch some matches at your local movie theater. With a huge screen, great sound and other fans, the atmosphere could be exciting.

Do you prefer pro wrestling or mixed martial arts fighting? You could soon see your favorite stars battling on the big screen.

Movie theater owners hope to show more than movies in their theaters.

Tim Warner is the head of a movie theater company called Cinemark with many theaters in the U.S. and Latin America. He had never heard of the British TV show "Dr. Who." It's about a man who travels through time having adventures.

## Only The Beginning

Warner was asked if he would like to show a special episode of the show live in his company's theaters. He wasn't sure if anyone would come. He wasn't sure if his company would make money.

In the end, he agreed. The episode came to theaters in late November. The fans came too. They filled theaters from Los Angeles to New York to Brazil.

Many of the fans came dressed as their favorite characters from the show. The theater had to add extra screens to make room for all the people.

"To be honest, many of us had never heard of 'Dr. Who,'" said Warner. "They told us it was going to sell out. We said, 'Yeah, right.' Not only did it sell out, but people showed up in costumes."

The event was a  success. It convinced Warner that "Dr. Who" was only the beginning.

He thinks that there are many types of entertainment that could bring people into movie theaters.

For the past several years, theaters have been trying out different things. Sports, opera, boxing, and mixed martial arts fights are popular.

Today, movie companies make only a tiny bit of their money from these new types of shows. But in three to five years, they could be making 10 times what they are making now.

## Going Digital

Studios and movie theaters have set up a new satellite network. They hope to use it to send live content to theaters.

The technology that movie theaters use is changing quickly. It is getting easier to send movies around the world.

In the past, movie theaters used old-fashioned film. The film was heavy. It was not very convenient.

Just like film cameras, movie film is going digital.

More recently, movies were put on hard drives and sent to theaters. Mailing the hard drives is still slow and expensive, though.

The new satellite system makes it much cheaper and easier to send movies to theaters.

Now, there are no trucks. There are no deliveries. It is all digital.

It used to cost $2,500 to mail a movie to a theater. It costs about $250 to mail hard drives. Using a satellite to send out the movie, however, costs only about $100.

## The New Network

Today, about three-fourths of the screens in the U.S. can use the satellite network.

Many things will be possible using the new network. Movie theaters could host video game tournaments where players can play against each other across the country in a live event.

Warner hopes his company can use the satellite network to show many different types of entertainment. He imagines live "American Idol" or college basketball games.

Putting live sports on movie screens might not be easy, though.

Television sports networks spend millions of dollars on the rights to show games. They may not want those games shown in theaters.

But Warner argues that theaters would work with TV networks, not compete with them.

He said it is just another way for people to enjoy their favorite shows.
