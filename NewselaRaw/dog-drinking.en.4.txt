Dogs are messy drinkers. If you give a thirsty dog a bowl of water, it will probably spill a lot on the floor. Now, scientists are better able to understand why dogs drink they way they do.

Every animal must drink water. Scientists are still learning about how dogs and cats drink.

Sunghwan Jung is a scientist who studies how animals drink water. Different animals drink water in different ways, he said.

## How They Each Drink

Some animals drink water by sucking it up. This way is called suction. Humans use suction. We use our cheeks to suck up liquid to drink. Our cheeks act like a vacuum inside our mouths. When we drink water through a straw, we suck it up like a vacuum. Not all animals drink this way.

Some animals cannot suck up liquid. Carnivores, or meat-eating animals, have different mouths. Their lips cannot close all the way. Animals like wolves and lions must used their tongues to drink water.

Cats also use their tongues to drink. First, they stick out their tongues. Then, they touch the top of the water with their tongues. Then, they bring their tongues close to their mouths. Water comes up too. The cats close their mouths over the water when it it comes up.

## Fast Drinking

Dogs also drink water in a special way.

Dogs stick their tongues out more than cats do. Their tongues touch more water because they are out farther. Dogs also move their tongues very fast when they scoop water up. They move their tongues faster than cats do.

So why are dogs so much messier when drinking than cats? Perhaps it is because dogs like water more than cats do, Jung said.
