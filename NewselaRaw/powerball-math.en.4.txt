Millions of people played the Powerball lottery. Three lucky people picked the winning numbers. On Wednesday, they won $1.6 billion.

Two days before that, a person posted a meme about Powerball on Facebook. A meme is a picture with a message that spreads through the Internet. The meme said the lottery could solve poverty.

## Getting The Math Wrong

"Powerball 1.3 billion ÷ U.S. pop 300 million," the meme reads. "Everyone receives 4.33 mil. Poverty solved!!" The meme was made on Monday. Then, the jackpot was $1.3 billion before the amount went higher.

The meme is incorrect because $1.3 billion divided by 300 million is $4.33\. That amount of money is not enough to help anyone. Also, the United States population was 308.7 million in 2010. 

Still, the meme became very popular. Hundreds of thousands liked it. Some people made fun of the meme's bad math, though. Others, however, agreed with the person who made the meme. His name is Philipe Andolini. His point is that there is enough money to solve poverty.

## Important Questions

The meme was not really about the lottery. It asks important questions. How can one person win so much money? Why do other people have almost nothing?

There is some good news. Powerball does sort of give money back to people in America.

Powerball is run by the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL). Powerball tickets cost $2\. When you buy a ticket, about $1 goes to prize money. Less than a dime pays to run the lottery. About 12 or 14 cents pays stores that sold tickets.

## Could Some Lottery Money Help The Poor?

What happens to the rest? The money goes straight back to the state where you bought your ticket. The state government decides what to do with it. Different states spend the money in different ways.

Kentucky spent $30 million on reading programs for children. Pennsylvania spent $25 million on programs for old people. In Washington state, the money helped build a baseball field.

Andolini's meme seems to make a point. He says that more Powerball money should help the poor. His math was wrong. Yet the reason behind it makes sense.
