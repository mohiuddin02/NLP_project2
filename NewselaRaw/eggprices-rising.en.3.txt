KANSAS CITY, Mo. â€” Three weeks ago, if you ordered three eggs at Roxanne's Cafe, you would probably get five eggs on your plate. Cooks did not count how many eggs they dropped into the frying pan. Owner Roxanne Gray gladly allowed it.

Today, Roxanne's is more strict. Three eggs means three eggs. There should be no more and no less, says Gray.

## Supermarket Egg Prices Triple

"I have one cook that I can't control his egging. He's not allowed to cook any eggs right now," Gray said.

That is because egg prices for Roxanne's Cafe have gone up tremendously in the past month. On May 5, Gray paid $17.55 per 15 dozen eggs. Last week, she paid $42.85.

Roxanne's Cafe is not alone. Some supermarkets have seen prices of a dozen eggs more than triple, from 99 cents to $3 in the past few weeks. The rising prices is caused by recent outbreaks of bird flu.

Jo Manhart is the head of the Missouri Egg Council. She called the bird flu outbreak one of the worst diseases to strike animals in America.

## Millions Of Hens Lost

Farmers have lost 47 million hens and turkeys since the virus began spreading a few months ago. Iowa, the country's top egg-producing state, has been hit the hardest. More than 30 million hens have been affected.

In Kansas, the virus has hit only 10 birds in a backyard flock. Despite this, last week the Kansas Department of Agriculture banned chickens, turkeys and other live birds from state and county fairs in 2015. Officials are afraid the poultry will spread the virus.

The outbreaks have meant that there are less eggs. Last week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture predicted that 95.9 billion eggs will be laid this year, while nearly 100 billion eggs were produced last year.

## Americans Were Eating More Eggs

The virus struck at a time when eggs were becoming pretty popular. Last year each person in America ate 263 eggs on average, the highest in 30 years.

Before the outbreak "eggs were on a roll," Kevin Burkum, an official with the American Egg Board. The group promotes eggs and egg farmers.

Roxanne's, probably like many cafes, is trying to make up for high egg prices. Gray changed the daily specials to include meals that do not include eggs. She has not offered lemon meringue pie in two weeks. The pie is made with a lot of eggs.

Gray hates the thought of raising menu prices.

Before the outbreak, farmers were paid 63 cents for a dozen eggs. The price is now $2.35, according to Brian Moscogiuri. He writes for a food industry newspaper.

## Makeup And Shampoo Use Eggs Too

Supermarkets are also struggling with the high egg prices.

Of course, eggs go into bakery items and ice cream. Other products are made with eggs, as well, like marshmallows, makeup and shampoo.

The Hen House grocery chain said it is paying a lot more for eggs. It has had to start charging shoppers more.

No one completely knows how chickens caught the virus from wild birds.

Some of it was through physical contact such as bird droppings. Hongwei Xin is the director of the Egg Industry Center at Iowa State University. He thinks that the virus can also travel through the air and seep into cracks of chicken barns.

Heat kills the virus. Outbreaks are expected to slow down in the summer.

Xin hopes that by fall scientists will learn enough to stop the outbreaks. He cannot promise, though.
