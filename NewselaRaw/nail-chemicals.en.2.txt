The nation's 375,000 nail technicians polish and file away fingernails and toenails every day. Those workers are exposed to chemicals in the polish and glue that can be harmful.

In a New York Times report last week, a number of workplace conditions in certain nail salons were shown to either improve or worsen the dangers. Technicians are exposed to chemicals in glues, removers, polishes and salon products at close range and in poorly ventilated spaces. They can be hazardous to individuals. And when combined, they could cause even greater harm. Still it is difficult to know how these chemicals affect the body. Current evaluations do not look at these substances completely.

## List Of Dangers Is Long

There are many risks: dust shavings from filed nails can settle on the skin like pollen and cause irritation or they can be inhaled. Those small particles could also contain chemicals from the polishes or acrylics. Technicians could inhale harmful vapors or mists from the chemicals in the shop. The chemicals might get into workers' eyes or could be swallowed while eating, drinking or smoking a cigarette.

The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) sets workplace safety standards. It has made a long list of chemicals that nail salon workers use daily. For the typical nail salon client, these chemicals may not be very dangerous. For workers who are exposed to all of the toxins day after day, there is a higher level of risk.

## Safety Equipment Would Help

Studies documenting the health problems of nail technicians often describe respiratory, skin and musculoskeletal issues. Respiratory problems, unsurprisingly, were typically associated with the reporting of workplace exposures such as poor air quality. Some of these chemicals are also linked to birth defects.

Nail salons could help protect workers by providing certain safety equipment. Public health officials say wearing special gloves could help shield against chemical exposures. Using a proper mask to protect workers from chemicals or nail-filing dust would also help. Paper dust masks, most often seen in a salon, only protect the wearer from some dusts but not chemicals. Good ventilation in a nail salon would also help.

## Be Safe And Aware

Here's the latest science on four nail salon chemicals of particular concern:

## - Toluene

This clear, colorless liquid occurs naturally in crude oil. It is also a common ingredient in nail polish and fingernail glue. Inhaling high levels of this substance in a short period can make someone light-headed and dizzy. Even more exposure could damage the nervous system. It can hurt the eyes, throat and lungs. Studies show that breathing high levels of the substance during pregnancy can cause problems for the babies after they are born.

## - Formaldehyde

This substance is used in nail polish and nail hardener. Studies show it can cause cancer. It can also irritate the eyes, skin and throat, causing coughing, allergic reactions, asthma or trouble breathing. Workers are advised by OSHA that wearing special masks can protect them from breathing in these vapors. Because even at low doses this substance can irritate the nose and eyes and affect short-term memory.

## - Dibutyl Phthalate

This substance is often used to make plastics softer and more flexible. Small amounts are used in nail polish and polish hardener. There is not much information on how exactly the chemical affects humans over the long-term. OSHA warns that exposure in humans can cause nausea and irritation to the respiratory tract and eyes.

It has an even worse affect on some animals, including rats and mice.

## - Methacrylate Compounds

Ethyl methacrylate (EMA) is the main substance in fake nails. It can be harmful for both nail salon workers and customers. It can cause allergies, asthma and can harm skin. To avoid risk, fake fingernails should be applied somewhere very open with plenty of fresh air. Health experts say workers removing fake nails should wear safety glasses to protect their eyes. They should also wear long sleeves and gloves to protect their skin from dust.

Avoiding these substances completely is difficult. Some nail products are labeled as "3-free"â€”which, if their labels are correct, would mean they were free of toluene, formaldehyde and dibutyl phthalate. Studies of some of these products, however, has found that their labels are often incorrect.

Sadly, chemicals are not the only things they have to worry about. Nail technicians can develop aches and pains from bending over or being in the same uncomfortable position for a long time. They also risk getting infections from touching a client's nails, blood or skin. Protective masks and gloves can help keep workers safe.
