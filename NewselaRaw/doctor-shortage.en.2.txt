The really dicey part, according to many health experts, is just beginning.

There may not be enough doctors and dentists to treat all these new patients. Experts fear Americans getting health insurance for the first time under Obamacare are likely to have problems. Getting to see a primary care doctor, dentist or mental health professional may not be smooth sailing.

Mental health professionals help people suffering from emotional problems. Primary care doctors treat all types of health problems. If the problem is too hard, they send patients to other doctors called specialists.

Some changes are in the works. The use of new technologies should help. And mid-level medical providers may be allowed to perform some duties usually done by doctors and dentists. That should help more people get health care in the long run.

"In the meantime," said Linda Rosenberg, president of the National Council for Behavioral Health, "people are going to suffer."

## By The Numbers

The Health Resources and Services Administration is the federal agency responsible for helping people get health care. According to it, nearly 20 percent of Americans live in areas with too few primary care doctors. Sixteen percent live in areas with too few dentists.

And a whopping 30 percent are in areas that are short of mental health providers.

Under federal guidelines, there should be no more than 3,500 people for each primary care provider; no more than 5,000 people for each dentist; no more than 30,000 people for each mental health provider.

According to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), unless something changes rapidly, there will be a shortfall of 45,000 primary care doctors in the United States by 2020.

There will also be a shortage of 46,000 specialists. They are doctors who just treat certain health problems. One might treat brain problems. Another might treat skin problems.

In some ways, the lack of providers is worse than the numbers indicate. Many primary care doctors and dentists do not accept Medicaid patients because they get paid less to treat them. Medicaid is government-funded health insurance for poor people. And many of the newly insured will be covered through Medicaid.

Many psychiatrists, who treat mental health problems, refuse to accept insurance at all.

## Aging Baby Boomers

Christiane Mitchell is a director at the AAMC. She predicts that many of the estimated 36 million Americans expected to gain coverage under Obamacare will endure long wait times to see medical providers in their communities. Or, they will have to find doctors far from home.

Mitchell said the AAMC pushed for the government to pay for training more doctors. But, it didn't happen. Obamacare was originally going to cost more than a trillion dollars over 10 years. So, several things were cut from it to make it cheaper.

There are various reasons for the shortfalls of doctors. One big reason is the aging of the baby boomers. That's the group of Americans born between 1946 and 1964.

The growing medical needs of that large age group are creating a huge burden for health care workers. The retirement of many doctors in the boomer age group is making the problem worse.

The federal government estimates the supply of doctors will increase by 7 percent in the next 10 years. But the number of Americans over 65 will grow by about 36 percent, according to the government.

Money also is a factor in the shortfalls. During the course of their careers, primary care physicians earn around $3 million less than doctors in specialty fields. That difference in pay makes primary care less appealing for many medical students.

In mental health, the problem is that much of the work is in government jobs. The pay there is far less than it is for providers in other medical specialties. Most of them work in private practice, or for hospitals.

As an example, according to the National Council for Behavioral Health, a registered nurse working in mental health earns $42,987. Yet, the national average for nurses is $66,530.

## Long Hours And Weekend Calls

But money is not the main reason that medical students are avoiding primary care, Mitchell said. In surveys of medical students conducted by AAMC, students valued "work-life balance" more than money when they were choosing their specialties.

Primary care often involves long hours and night and weekend calls. For students today, that type of schedule is not very desirable.

"Half of the physicians in training are women," Mitchell said. Many want children, so they're looking for jobs that don't involve being on call.

"Men are more engaged in child care today, and they have similar concerns as they consider their career choices," she says.

Insurance headaches, pricey technologies, and the risk of getting sued has made medicine a less attractive career, says Rosenberg of the National Council for Behavioral Health. It's convinced many talented students to skip medicine as a career choice.

"Nowadays," Rosenberg said, "the best and the brightest" are talking about becoming bankers, or getting technology jobs by "going off to Silicon Valley."
