LOS ANGELES â€” Four California high schools will have two years to pick a new school mascot. All of the schools currently identify their sports teams as the Redskins, but now that name is banned in California. Governor Jerry Brown recently signed legislation that makes the state the first in the country to bar public schools from using the Redskins name for their sports teams.

The mascot legislation, unique to California, will prevent public schools from using a word that many Native Americans regard as insulting. The word dates back to 1699, and is listed in the Merriam Webster dictionary as a "usually offensive" term for a Native American.

## All Schools Do Not Support The Ban

In California, only four public schools still use the name Redskins, and Tulare Union High is one. Sarah Koligian, the superintendent of Tulare Joint Union High School District, said officials were disappointed by Brown's decision. However, she added, they will change the name of their sports teams.

"We will adhere to the law as it is written. Together with our Board of Trustees, school community and our Tulare community we will seek their input to determine our new mascot," Koligian said.

The Chowchilla Union High School District also uses the mascot. They plan to ask the public to help come up with a new name. The superintendent there, Ronald V. Seals, said Chowchilla has used a Redskins mascot and logo since 1928 without complaints. "You don't pick a mascot that you don't respect, dignify, love, honor, all those things," he said. "It's just taking away something that's so near and dear to their hearts ... and by people who don't even live here."

Two other schools, Gustine High in Merced County, and Calaveras High in Calaveras County, California, are also known as the Redskins. They too, will now have to come up with a new name and mascot.

## Washington Redskins Fighting Name Change

A National Football League (NFL) team has been facing similar pressure to change its name. Native American groups are protesting the continued use of the Redskins name in their court battle with the Washington Redskins. The NFL team, based in Washington, D.C., faces fierce opposition from the groups who consider its name to be a racial insult.

Last year, a federal court panel ruled that the Washington Redskins will lose the trademark on its name, and this year a federal judge upheld that decision. The team is fighting the decision in an appeals court.

Oneida Native American Ray Halbritter is a member of a group called Change The Mascot. He sees a clear connection between the California mascot ban and the NFL Washington Redskins battle.

"This landmark legislation eliminating the R-word in California schools clearly demonstrates that this issue is not going away, and that opposition to the Washington team on this issue is only intensifying. The NFL should act immediately to press the team to change the name," Halbritter said.

## Smokeless Tobacco Is Out Too

In addition to the ban on the Redskins name, the California governor signed two other sports-related bills into law. One measure bans players and coaches from using smokeless tobacco at professional baseball parks. The other recognizes competitive cheerleading as a high school sport.

The smokeless tobacco measure bars players and coaches from having the product on the playing field at all California professional ballparks.

Smokeless tobacco is a form of cured tobacco. The two main types most commonly available in the United States are chewing tobacco and moist snuff. Both are used by placing the tobacco between the cheek or lip, and the gum.

Major League Baseball, whose teams use the parks, said it supported banning smokeless tobacco when the proposal was introduced earlier this year. Smokeless tobacco is already prohibited in minor leagues.

Public health officials who support the proposal say that more young people are using smokeless tobacco, even while cigarette use drops. They say smokeless tobacco still contributes to oral, pancreatic and esophageal cancers, as well as other diseases.

In California, the smokeless tobacco law expands on local bans already in place in San Francisco and Los Angeles. It is not yet clear how the statewide ban will be enforced.

## Cheerleaders Get Recognition

The governor also approved a bill last week that requires the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) to oversee competitive cheerleading as an official sport by the 2018 school year. The CIF is the governing body for high school athletics in California, and already oversees many other high school sports.

Competitive cheerleading is when cheer squads compete against each other. Teams perform routines with music that include stunts, jumps and tumbling.

"The formal recognition will give cheerleading the respect and safety standards that athletes deserve," Democratic Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez of San Diego said. She introduced the bill. Gonzalez is a former high school and college cheerleader, and said at least eight other states already treat competitive cheerleading as a sport.

The two laws regarding the mascot ban and the inclusion of competitive cheerleading will both take effect in 2017. The smokeless tobacco ban at professional ballparks goes into effect before next season.
