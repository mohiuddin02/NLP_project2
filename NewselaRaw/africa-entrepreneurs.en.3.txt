KAMPALA, Uganda â€” In 2004, Madinah Nalukenge was a single mother facing hard times. She had tried selling bed sheets, but that didn't work.

Using her last $10, she began cooking and selling food at a bus station in Uganda's capital. She offered mashed vegetables and greasy meats to workers and commuters.

Now, 10 years later, she is running a catering business that makes up to $3,000 per month.

For Nalukenge, her business is not just a way to make money. It is also something she is very proud of.

"There is a lot of money to be made here," she said recently, her apron overflowing with cash. "I need to stay focused."

She has competition, though: more than a dozen other women are selling food near her.

## Hungry Children

The food sellers in downtown Kampala had similar reasons for starting their businesses: hungry children, unpaid rent. Most of the women are single.

Being a single mother can actually be an advantage, these women point out. Their past husbands or boyfriends were often uncooperative, or even violent. Now, completely independent, they are free to run their businesses, and their households, as they like.

"They don't help and they never want to help," Nalukenge said of her former partners. "Yet even the little you get they want to take away from you. I was alone when I started this business."

Nalukenge and her fellow food-vendors are part of a larger trend happening in Africa. More women are starting their own businesses than ever before.

For these women, the need to make money drives them to start a small business. Since there are not many opportunities, they must make their own.

## Success Stories

Many women work by themselves, selling things, or providing a service. But some female [entrepreneurs](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=entrepreneur), or independent businesspeople, have been able to grow their business, and hire many employees.

"Traditionally women would sit at home and wait for the man to return home with a bag of groceries. This has been changing over time as women's dependence gradually reduces," said Thomas Bwire, an economist with Uganda's central bank.

The number of successful women entrepreneurs in Africa is growing. Some of them have become famous after their businesses succeeded wildly.

A Kenyan woman, Mary Okello, is celebrated for starting a school inside a three-bedroom house that has since become a respected group of private schools.

In Rwanda, Janet Nkubana has been recognized abroad for running a handicrafts company that employs more than 3,000 women. Their baskets can be purchased at Macy's.

## Helping Their Country

The Nigerian Adenike Ogunlesi is famous for her "Ruff 'n' Tumble" clothing line for children. She first ran that business out of a car trunk.

Economists who study developing countries point out that women starting businesses can help boost a country's economy.

One problem these women face is the lack of credit. It is common to borrow money to start a business, then pay the money back when the business has become successful. But because these women are so poor, no bank will lend them money.

The World Bank estimates that there is a $300 billion credit gap for female-owned businesses. This means that these businesses could use $300 billion in order to grow, but no one is willing to loan it to them.

In order to address this problem, the World Bank has started a $600 million fund it calls the Women Entrepreneurs Opportunity Facility. This fund aims to lend money to 100,000 women entrepreneurs.

## "We Get Our Reward"

In Uganda, it is difficult for the food sellers to get loans to grow their businesses. They pool their money, and take turns borrowing money from banks.

According to Ugandan economist Fred Muhumuza, women who have started their own businesses have surprised themselves by succeeding.

He added that extreme poverty is causing women to take over "core family responsibilities" from men.

Nalukenge, the food vendor in downtown Kampala, said she has kept her children in school and now owns two small plots of land.

On a recent evening she considered her unlikely journey from failed seller of bed sheets to successful caterer with a long line of loyal clients.

"We spend a lot of energy here," she said. "There's no resting. But at the end of the day we get our reward."
