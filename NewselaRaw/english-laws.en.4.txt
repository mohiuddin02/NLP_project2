WASHINGTON - Almost 61 million people speak a language other than English at home. A couple of years ago that number was only 55 million. The number is growing fast.

Most countries in the world have an official language. The United States does not. The U.S. government doesn't force people to speak and write only in English.

But states and cities can. They can choose to have an official language.

In some places, people believe that English should be the only language. That means that all types of communication should be done only in English.

## The Country Has Changed

Other places have large numbers of people from other countries. In California, for example, almost half of the state's population speak other languages at home.

In places like California, many believe that the government should make it easier for those who do not speak English. The government can do that by translating forms and papers into other languages.

"Things are changing," said Patricia Gandara. She teaches at a university in California.

The United States is becoming a place where many languages are spoken, she said.

Right now, 31 states have a law making English their official language. Five other states might add such laws.

Some people say that the English language helps unite the country.

Karin Davenport works for a group called U.S. English. It wants immigrants to learn English. She explained that choosing English as the official language does not stop people from also speaking other languages.

She believes that it is harder for immigrants if they don't learn to speak English. They will struggle to mix with others, she said.

## Following The Rules

It's not easy to make everybody follow the same rules. Even in states where English is the official language it can be difficult.

In California, English is the official language. California has government websites that are also in Spanish.

California wants drugstores to help people understand drug instructions. Some customers can't read the instructions on their medicine. The state wants the drugstores to give them instructions in their own language.

Evan Weibel works for a company named Language Scientific. It translates information into other languages.

The need for translation is "not going to go away," he said. More will probably be needed as the U.S. population grows.
