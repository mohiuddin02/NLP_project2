BALTIMORE — Professor James Gates has big ideas. He also has a talent for expressing those ideas simply, but dramatically.

For example, this is what he says about making kids' science classes easier: It's like teaching them to dunk a basketball on a 9-foot-high hoop. What's the problem with that, you say? The problem is that the kids the next town over play with one 10 feet high.

Gates is a scientist himself. He has colorful opinions not only about science teaching, but also about his fellow scientists.

When scientists all think the same way, he says, science isn't as bold as it can be. Or, as he put it: You get nothing but classical music. "When you let different people create different music, you get things like rock 'n' roll, jazz."

## Explaining Complicated Ideas

Gates teaches at the University of Maryland, College Park. His goal is to turn complicated math into something easy to understand. In place of equations, Gates expresses complicated ideas with pictures.

Gates has been getting a lot of attention recently. Part of this attention is for his own scientific work. At the same time, he has been praised widely for something else: his ability to explain complicated ideas better than anyone else.

Last year, Gates received a National Medal of Science. Last month, the Harvard Foundation named him Scientist of the Year. Gates was also picked to advise President Barack Obama on science and technology.

Gates is about as famous as a scientist can get. In one popular video, he attempts to explain an extremely complicated scientific theory in 30 seconds.

"Most scientists, we get busy with our own work. Not many take the time to spread it at a level that is" understandable for "the general public," said Professor Jogesh Pati. "Jim has great strength in doing it. Beautifully, he does it."

## Eye-Opening Classes

Gates' work is devoted to simplifying the complicated.

The 63-year-old's interest in science was originally sparked by two things. The first was a science fiction movie he saw as a small boy. The second was a book on space travel his father brought home. Before choosing to be a scientist, he nearly became an astronaut.

Gates came to College Park in 1984. Since then, he has taught classes nearly every semester.

Gates first realized he loved teaching while he was still at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, one of the best schools for math and science in the country. At that school, he tutored members of the Black Student Union. Back then, many black students didn't feel comfortable asking teachers for help, Gates said.

"To me that was really exciting, to get that light to turn on in their eyes," Gates said.

Students who have taken Gates' classes say they are eye-opening. This is thanks to his ability to explain the bigger picture.

## Something Of Real Value

These days, Gates has much more than his own students to think about. In 2009, Gov. Martin O'Malley chose him to help schoolchildren statewide. He is partly responsible for deciding what Maryland public school science classes should teach.

Gates' powers of explanation have been put to other uses as well: They have helped him bring science to TV audiences.

For example, he appeared on a show called "The Secret Life of Scientists and Engineers." On the show, he lays out in half a minute the idea behind string theory — or most of it. "I tried," he says at the end.

In another Nova program, he laid out his goal for himself: To do something of real value for people everywhere.

Science, Gates said, improves our lives. One day, he added, it may save us from [global warming](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming) and other dangers.
