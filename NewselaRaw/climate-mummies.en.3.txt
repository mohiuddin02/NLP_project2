About 7,000 years ago, a group of people called the Chinchorro lived along the coasts of northern Chile and southern Peru. Their lives revolved around fishing in the Pacific Ocean. Yet, just behind them, farther inland, was a desert — the Atacama. It has often been called the driest place on the planet.

The Chinchorro were unique in many ways, but perhaps most of all in how they buried their people. They created the oldest-known mummies on Earth, beating the Egyptians by several thousand years. In 1917, Chinchorro mummies were first discovered in the Atacama Desert.

The Chinchorro mummified their dead much like the Egyptians did. Yet, there were some differences. "The Egyptians considered only kings and other (important) citizens worthy of mummification," wrote Bernardo Arriaza, an expert on the mummies. But, "the Chinchorro mummified everyone, regardless of age or status."

## Newer Mummies Are Not In Great Shape

Since 1917, hundreds of mummies have been dug up, and more are being uncovered all the time. But lately, there has been a problem. They have started to decay.

More than 100 are stored at a museum of the Universidad de Tarapacá in Arica, Chile. "The tissue change is reflected in the appearance of dark and bright spots," Marcela Sepulveda, an archaeologist at the Universidad, explained.

The mummies in the museum have been slow to decay, but outdoors, mummies are being discovered already damaged, Sepulveda said. When you dig up the mummies, you can see they are already harmed, she said. And the suspected reason? A changing climate.

The Earth is slowly getting warmer and storm patterns have changed. Scientists blame humans burning oil, gas and coal for some of the changes.

## More Rain Is Not Always Good

Arica is often called the driest place on Earth. Now locals say that is changing. According to Sepulveda, the city has seen more rain, snow and humidity lately. In fact, weather records from 1971 to 2000 suggest it has become wetter lately.

This may not be a change that can definitely be blamed on global climate change caused by humans, cautioned Ralph Mitchell. He is a Harvard University microbiologist. But the climate is changing all the same. Chilean scientists have noticed that "the place is foggy a lot more than it ever was," Mitchell said. He teamed up with the Chilean researchers to figure out what was ailing the mummies.

Many mummies found in the 1980s had no problems until 10 years ago. At that point they started to fall apart, he said. That alone suggests climate may be part of the reason for what is happening.

So Mitchell and two other researchers from Harvard collaborated with Sepulveda. They wanted to figure out what was going on. They had a theory: more moisture from the air had enabled bacteria to start to eat the ancient relics.

They studied samples of mummy skin and dried pig skin, in various conditions. They examined which tiny organisms were living on and in the skin. Mitchell said they found that bacteria was taking advantage of a more humid environment. The bacteria was using the skin as food and starting "to break it down."

## Not Only Mummies At Risk

The story of the Chinchorro mummies illustrates just how at risk many cultural artifacts may be to a changing climate — whether it is caused by humans or not. It is something that the United Nations (U.N.) has thought about for some time. Its UNESCO agency names certain places as World Heritage sites because of their importance to nature or culture. A 2007 report from the U.N. agency noted that climate change is affecting many sites and will likely touch "many more, both natural and cultural, in the years ahead."

The U.S. Agency for International Development is also concerned about how climate change can affect cultural sites. It describes buildings in the medieval city of Leh in Ladakh, India. They were "constructed in a high altitude desert environment" and are suffering from increases in rain.

Archaeology magazine listed yet another example. The burial mounds of Scythian warlords, called "kurgans," had been frozen and preserved in permafrost near Siberia, Russia. In this case, it was ice, not desert, that had preserved remains for such a wonderfully long time. Now the Arctic is thawing. As the ice protecting them melts, these irreplaceable artifacts could be lost.

Mitchell suspects there could soon be a new climate victim: outdoor marble statues, such as those in Greece and Rome.

## Still A Mystery

So we may not know exactly what is happening in Arica, Chile. We also may not know whether humans are to blame. We do know these artifacts and sites are being damaged. The reason many of these sites have been so well preserved for so long is that they were unaffected by climate. The surroundings stayed the same.

If the climate continues to change, the world could lose some of its history.
