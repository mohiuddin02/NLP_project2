LOS ANGELES, Calif. â€” Jorge Magana, age 18, got all dressed up for his big presentation. He had 45 minutes to talk and a big goal.

Magana is a senior at Los Angeles High School of the Arts. He had to convince three judges that he was ready for graduation. One of the judges was his assistant principal. The other two were also important people from his school.

Magana wanted the judges to say he was finished with high school and could move on to college. He wanted to graduate. Magana showed them his portfolio and explained everything in it.

The portfolio was a collection of slides of his best schoolwork. It covered all four years of high school. Sharing his portfolio with the judges was sort of like flipping through a photo album of his most important projects. Magana took his time explaining each one.

## Portfolios Are Gaining Popularity With Schools

Then it was the judges' turn to ask their questions: Where did you find your facts? What was the hardest part? How will the skills you learned help with your future plans?

Portfolio presentations like Magana's are not common at high schools. Most high schools use report cards to decide which students get to graduate. Scores from multiple choice tests also make a difference.

Portfolio presentations are a newer way to see which students are ready to leave high school. They are expensive and they take a long time. Still, these presentations are gaining popularity, especially in California.

Soon, every high school senior in Los Angeles will have to present a portfolio before they graduate. Ten high schools are already testing the program. More schools plan to start using the program next school year.

## Changing Teachers' Minds

Isabel Morales teaches 12th grade at Magana's school. At first, she and the other teachers thought the presentations were too much work.

Now, Morales says she loves seeing students reflect on what they have learned. "Watching them has taught me how much my lessons count," she said.

Sometimes, students simply "go through the motions" in class, said Morales. They take in information without really understanding it, she explained.

Portfolio presentations push students to explain what they have learned, Morales said.

## Two Times For Passing Grade

It was tricky for Magana. He did not get a passing grade on his presentation because he had a hard time explaining himself. The judges did not get to hear how much Magana really knew about his projects.

Morales says seeing students like Magana struggle has taught her a lot. It has helped her change the way she teaches. She wants her students to be comfortable giving presentations.

Morales says now she makes time in class so students can share their work. She wants them to get used to talking about what they have learned.

Magana got another shot at giving his presentation. He showed the judges his portfolio again a week later and passed.

## Learning From Mistakes

Now Magana is heading off to the University of California in Riverside to study computer science. He said he has learned from his mistakes and will not repeat them in college.

"I'm worried that in college I won't have anyone there to push me," Magana said. "I will remember this experience. I won't allow myself to fail again."

Out of the 92 seniors who presented their portfolios this year, 33 failed. Those students all got to re-do their presentations. In the end, everyone passed. They were all allowed to graduate.
