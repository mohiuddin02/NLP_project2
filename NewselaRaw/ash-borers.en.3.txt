A tiny insect from China is expected to kill nearly all ash trees in the eastern United States. The glitter-green, half-inch bug is known as the emerald ash borer.

Now, there is more disturbing news: The borer may have found a new target.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that the borer had attacked the white fringe tree. The fringe tree is in the same family as the ash, and is related to forsythia and lilac.

Experts don't quite know what to make of the announcement. But they are worried.

## More Bug Questions Than Answers

Tom Tiddens is in charge of plant health care at the Chicago Botanic Garden. "This is bringing up more questions than answers," he said.

The Botanic Garden has 42 beautiful fringe trees of its own to worry about.

Will the borer kill fringe trees, as it does ashes? Or will it just damage them?

Maybe the insect was merely taste-testing a close relative of the ash. After all, there are only very few ash trees left alive in Ohio. That's where the discovery was made by a college science professor on a walk. He passed a fringe tree and decided to examine it. Bingo! There the bugs were.

Perhaps the bugs were just sampling a fringe tree, Tiddens said. They could have been trying different trees only because they could not find any ashes.

A much scarier explanation is that the insect itself is changing. It could be developing the ability to live off of other kinds of trees besides ash.

Scientists have wondered for years what would happen once the bugs killed off most ash trees. "It makes sense they would begin feeding on other stuff in the same family," Tiddens said.

## New States, New Trees, New Tastes

Pennsylvania and New Jersey are now experiencing the early stages of the borer's attack. Officials in both places are watchful, but not yet alarmed. The fringe tree isn't common in either state, fortunately.

Forsythias or lilacs would not be likely targets, he said. They do not have enough bark to meet the insect's needs. Neither "has enough meat on the bones, so to speak," Kurtz said.

The Ohio discovery has made people take another look at the borer, Kurtz said. Scientists had thought the borer was only interested in ashes. Only time will tell if the insect has changed its ways.

## Slow Death For The Trees

Don Eggen, a Pennsylvania bug expert, is also not too worried yet. So far in his state the borer problem is just something "to keep a lookout for."

The emerald ash borer is only one of many borers that attack trees. It has been chomping its way south and east from Detroit, where it was discovered in 2002. It is believed to have entered the Detroit port on wooden packing containers from China.

The borer lays its eggs on the bark of ashes. Eventually, the larvae surround and squeeze the tree. They cut off the flow of chemicals and minerals the tree needs and in time, the tree dies.

Dead or dying trees are dangerous, as they can hurt people or property when they fall. Taking down so many dead ash trees has been very expensive.
