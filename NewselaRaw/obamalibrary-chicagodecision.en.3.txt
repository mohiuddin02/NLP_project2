In a video released Tuesday, the president and his wife said the library will be on the city's South Side. It will be built in a park. No decision has been made, though,  whether it will be built in Jackson Park or Washington Park.

"All the strands of my life came together  and I really became a man when I moved to Chicago," the president said in the video, which showed him seated with his wife, Michelle Obama. Chicago is where he set up a job training program and a tutoring program to help students prepare for college.

"That's where I met my wife. That's where my children were born," he said.

## Neighborhood Is Important To Michelle Obama

Michelle Obama grew up in Chicago. She said she was "thrilled" to put the library "in the heart of the neighborhood that means the world to me. Every value, every memory, every important relationship to me exists in Chicago. I consider myself a South Sider."

After leaving office, each U.S. president traditionally builds a presidential library. It is both a museum and a special place to keep papers and historical items from a president's time in office.

The Barack Obama Foundation is in charge of the project. It said it would get ideas from universities, leaders and community groups as it makes its plans.

For more than a year, the University of Chicago had competed with three other universities for the library. They are Columbia University in New York, the University of Hawaii in Honolulu and the University of Illinois at Chicago.

The foundation said it still plans to work with the three that did not win. It plans to explore and develop a long-term relationship with Columbia. Also, it will work with the state of Hawaii, where Obama was born, to create something there, the foundation said.

## Contest For The Library Lasted A Year

The decision ends a yearlong contest. Originally there were 13 proposed sites that were narrowed down to four finalists.

The foundation had planned to make the library announcement in March. It delayed its plans until after the April 7 election for mayor in Chicago.

The University of Chicago had long been considered the favorite candidate.

Obama taught law there for a dozen years and first lady Michelle Obama worked at the university's hospital. Chicago's South Side also was where Obama launched his political career as a state senator in 1996. It was also where the first lady was born.

However, the University of Chicago's idea to build the library on the South Side became caught up in a battle over the use of parkland. Some people in Chicago did not think that a public park should be used for the private library.
