WASHINGTON â€” First lady Michelle Obama gave a speech on Friday. Her talk was part of an event held to mark Black History Month.

Obama said that the most important thing for blacks today is to get a good education. Blacks should finish high school and then go to college, she said.

A group of women joined Obama at the event. All had taken part in the civil rights movement. The civil rights movement tried to win equal rights for black Americans.

The women are all very different from each other, the first lady said. Still, "there is something that connects each of their stories," she said. They all believe in "the power of education."

## Going To School Was A Struggle

Charlayne Hunter-Gault and Carlotta Walls LaNier were two of the women who joined Obama. Both had to fight hard just to go to school.

During the 1960s, Hunter-Gault was one of the first black students to study at the University of Georgia. Before that, the school had only let white people study there.

During the 1950s, LaNier was one of a group of black high school students known as the Little Rock Nine. They were not allowed to go to Little Rock Central High School in Arkansas. At the time, Little Rock only had white students. LaNier later became the first black woman to graduate from the school.

## A Good Education Is Still Hard For Some

Times have changed since the 1960s, Obama said. Still, there are problems. Crowds of white people do not throw things at black students anymore. There are no rules against black women going to college. Still, many black people find it hard to get a good education.

Not long ago, black students needed to be protected by soldiers just to go to school. Today, that is no longer true, Obama said, but black students still are not getting a good education.

More blacks are finishing high school than ever before. When compared to other races though, a smaller fraction of black students are graduating from high school. They finish high school far less often than other races.

## Education Can Solve Problems

There were many young black women at Friday's event. Obama said they should finish school no matter what. Get yourself an education, she said.

Blacks who are not educated are more likely to be poor. They are more likely to be sent to prison. Education is an important way to help solve these problems, Obama said.

The first lady went to two very good schools. She graduated from Princeton University and Harvard Law School. She leads a program for high school students. It is called Reach Higher and it supports kids who want to go to college.

"Education is still the key to success," LaNier said. "You need all the education you can possibly get."
