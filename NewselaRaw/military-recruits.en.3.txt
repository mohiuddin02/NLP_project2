The U.S. military recently said women can serve in combat. Many women were happy about the decision. They said it shows the military supports equality. But being fair was not the only reason military leaders made the change.

The number "of military-age young men, who qualify for the military, is declining," said General Martin Dempsey. The general made his comments on National Public Radio (NPR).

## Drugs, Dropouts And Arrests

According to the NPR report, too many young men cannot join the military. Some are barred because they have had trouble with the law. Others lack a high school diploma. Drug use is another reason many young men fail to qualify.

To join the military, recruits must pass a math and reading test. They must have a clean criminal record. They also need to pass a drug test. For young American men, these standards are getting harder to meet. In all 50 states, more boys than girls drop out of school. Three-fourths of all arrests in the United States are of young men.

## Young Women Wanted

The military looked ahead to the year 2020. If more boys keep dropping out of school and getting arrested, there will be a problem. The military fears there might not be enough qualified young men to fill the ranks. So it decided it needs more women to join.

That is part of the reason the military decided to let women serve in combat. By opening up combat roles to women, it hopes more women will apply. The change shows that women can do anything in the military, just like men.

Combat roles can involve tanks, heavy weapons and ground fighting. They were previously off-limits to female troops. The jobs are tough and dangerous. But serving in combat can lead to a promotion.

Still, allowing women to serve in combat by itself cannot solve the headcount problem. Earning a spot in a combat unit is hard. Servicewomen will have to pass a very tough training course. They will need to be as fit as possible.

## Fighting Fat

Poor fitness keeps many men and women from joining the military. More than a quarter of Americans aged 17 to 24 are too heavy to serve.

The U.S. military cannot respond to threats if it does not have enough troops. Nor can it accomplish its missions.

Today, only one in four young Americans has what it takes to qualify for the military. This fact bothered a group of retired military leaders. They decided to take action. They formed a group called "Mission: Readiness." Its goal is to foster better fitness and education for American youth.

U.S. security depends on a strong military. But it is not just tanks and missiles that make the military strong. Better preschools and more gym classes will help too, Mission: Readiness says. That way, kids will grow up smart enough and strong enough to be ready for military service.

## Junk Food Threat

Mission: Readiness wants to help kids slim down. It is targeting junk food. Every year children eat 400 billion calories in junk food at school. That is equal to nearly 2 billion candy bars. An aircraft carrier weighs less than 2 billion candy bars.

The group also wants schools to have more physical education. When schools are short of money, gym class often gets cut. Just six states require gym classes for grades K-12.

## Basic Training Starts In Pre-K

The military leaders complain that too many high school students are failing the Army's entrance exam. They say it is too late to start preparing them at 17 or 18. "We must start with high-quality early education such as pre-kindergarten and Head Start," wrote retired Major General John Libby. He is a member of Mission: Readiness.

Libby pointed out that preschool teaches self-control and motivation. It also shows kids how to be a team player. Those are all the skills that soldiers need too, he noted.
