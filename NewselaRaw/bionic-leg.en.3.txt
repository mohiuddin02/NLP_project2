A lot goes into walking. It takes balance, strength and brainpower. Just ask Zac Vawter. He lost his leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009. But with the help of a team of scientists and doctors, he has taught a whole new type of artificial leg to walk, kick and do everything else that a leg does.

The team includes scientists who develop software, surgeons, and people who make artificial limbs called prosthetics. Together they designed a leg that can receive commands directly from Vawter's brain.

The leg has learned to read what Vawter wants it to do. A bundle of nerves that end above his missing knee gives signals to the leg, a scientific report said.

Roughly 1 million Americans  have lost a leg or part of one. Vawter and his robotic leg offer hope that future prosthetics might feel more natural.

## Imagine It, And It Happens

Vawter's prosthetic is a marvel of 21st century engineering. But Vawter's ability to control the prosthetic with his thoughts makes his case remarkable. If he wants his artificial toes to curl toward him all he has to do is imagine the movements. The same with shifting his artificial ankle so he can walk down a ramp.

The work was done at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago. The Army paid $8 million for the study. About 1,200 service men and women have lost a leg in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The armed forces hope studies like this one will help them.

"We want to restore full capabilities" to people who have lost a lower limb, said Levi J. Hargrove. He worked on the new report.

The leg weighs just over 10 pounds. It has two separate engines. One powers movement in the ankle and the other in the knee. It has sensors that are capable of detecting and measuring movement all over.

In most prosthetics, the wearer has to turn a key to change from one type of movement to another. Not so in Vawter's robotic leg.

## "Teaching" The Leg To Read

"With this leg, it just flows," said the 32-year-old software engineer. "There isn't anything special I have to do to make it work right." Vawter lives in Washington. Most of the time he uses a typical prosthetic. But he travels to Chicago several times a year to work with the robotic leg.

Vawter couldn't just strap on the bionic lower limb. First engineers in Chicago had to "teach" the leg how to read tiny muscle movements in his right thigh. Those movements told the leg what Vawter wanted it to do.

Vawter spent hours with his thigh wired up. He imagined making certain movements with his missing knee, ankle and foot.

Engineers broke down those recorded electrical signals to log an entire collection of movements. They used special software to do this. The prosthetic could then be programmed to recognize the smallest twitch of a muscle in Vawter's thigh.

It took a new type of surgery to make this possible, though. In most amputations, the nerves in the thigh are left to wither or die.

## Rewiring The Severed Nerves

Dr. Todd Kuiken is a neurosurgeon at the rehabilitation institute. He developed the new method. It is called "reinervation." Vawter's orthopedic surgeon was trained in the delicate operation. He rewired the severed nerves to control some of the muscles in Vawter's thigh. The muscles would be used less frequently after the amputation.

Those nerves recovered from the shock of the injury. Then they began to regrow. They could carry electrical signals. When Vawter thought about flexing his right foot in a particular way, the nerve endings would cause a special motion in his hamstring. The same sort of thing happened with other muscle movements.

The bionic leg performs better than standard prosthetics, according to the report. The robotic leg, programmed to follow Vawter's commands, reduced errors by 44 percent. Those errors cause unnatural movements, pain and falls.

Vawter said he had "fallen down a whole bunch of times" while wearing his everyday prosthetic. He has not fallen once while moving around on his bionic leg.

He said he could move a lot faster too â€” which would be helpful for keeping up with his 5-year-old son and 3-year-old daughter. But first, Vawter added, he needs to persuade Hargrove's team to let him wear it home.
