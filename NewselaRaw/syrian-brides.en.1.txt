CAIRO - On the outskirts of the vast Egyptian capital, Egypt ends and the latest Syria enclave begins. Women tie their headscarves in a distinctly Syrian way. They buy Syrian spices and trinkets from vendors whose shops are now tables lining the streets. There is a constant murmur of stories about the civil war that forced the residents to flee their home country in the past year.

The only sign that one is still in Egypt is the sound of Egyptian men and their mothers. They flock every day in the hopes they can exploit the dashed hopes of the Syrian revolution. Too poor to take an Egyptian bride, the men have heard that Syrian refugees are cheaper, prettier, better cooks and easier to marry.

Outside the local mosque where people come to pray, a 39-year-old painter approaches a Syrian man selling pita bread. "I am looking for a Syrian bride," the painter says, his calloused hands showing his struggle to survive. "They are less complicated."

The Syrian bread seller has heard this a dozen times already that day and does not even respond, but rather points to a sign in front of the mosque behind him. It says that the mosque "has nothing to do with the marriage of Egyptian men to Syrian sisters. That's why there shouldn't be any questions regarding this issue in any of the offices of the organization. May Allah punish those responsible for spreading these rumors."

The painter is undeterred. "Maybe there are Syrian women around the corner?" he asks.

The Syrian, who asks that he be identified only as Khalid, just shakes his head.

## Trying to Buy a Bride Like Buying a Chicken

Before the sign, Khalid said, he fielded the question 100 times a day; now it is only 50. It is difficult to know if he's exaggerating.

"They ask us where the office is to buy a Syrian woman, as if they are buying a chicken. They don't believe us when we tell them it doesn't exist," said Khalid, who said he is 26. "Our women are not for sale. We are here because we did not want to be killed."

Men across the region are now seeking Syrian brides. In Turkey and Jordan, where refugee camps pepper the landscape, the desperation of the Syrians is far easier to spot as rich Persian Gulf men scour the camps to buy brides living in tents. Rape, child brides and temporary marriages are prevalent.

"People are marrying off their daughters for as little as 100 Jordanian dinars ($70) because of the bad circumstances inside the camp," said Marwa al-Saloumy, who works on women's issues for a regional advocacy group called Al-Zahra.

But in Cairo, where there are no camps, the dashed dreams of both Egyptians and Syrians in the post-Arab Spring world meet on more equal terms. Egyptian men, now poorer as the economy founders, find hope in the desperate Syrians, who cannot live in their own nation. Their revolution promised change but has brought devastation and forced flight instead.

Syrian women say the men instantly spot them by their dress and approach them constantly. Alaa, a woman who fled Damascus three months ago to the Helwan neighborhood that has now become a Syrian enclave, said the harassment has been one of her biggest challenges.

## Avoiding a Forced Marriage

In light of what is happening in Syria, "this is not the time to marry and celebrate and enjoy life," Alaa said. And because of it, "Egyptian women now are starting to hate Syrian woman."

That Egyptian men believe they could marry someone for less is changing marriage across Egypt. Men are demanding more of women and are willing to offer less, women report, and the standards for taking a bride are falling. Where an Egyptian man was once expected to provide a home and prove he can work before he could marry, now many believe they can have a Syrian bride for as little as $45.

The men come to the areas where Syrians have gathered all day, hoping to escape forced marriages or no prospects at all. They go to the mosque, to the makeshift Syrian vendors, to apartment complexes where Syrians are known to live. They approach one stranger after another, asking for a woman in the same tone they would ask directions -- security guards at apartment complexes, Muslim clergy, anyone whose accent identifies them as Syrian.

## Blaming Assad

For the Syrians, defending the women in their community has become a means to maintain their dignity while living as refugees. Meanwhile, back in Syria, President Bashar al-Assad still clings to power.

"The thugs of Bashar Assad have spread these false rumors," explained Khalid. "He has destroyed our nation and now he is destroying the reputation of our women."

According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, there are nearly 70,000 Syrian refugees living in Egypt. Most live in and around Cairo, and have arrived in the last year.

But it is unclear how many Egyptians have taken a Syrian bride. Instead, it is a crisis built on rumor.

One regional women's organization reported recently that 12,000 Syrian women have married Egyptian men in the last year. But according to the Ministry of Justice in Egypt, the official number of marriages between Egyptian men and Syrian women between January 2012 and March 2013 is 170. Fifty-seven of those nuptials happened between January and March 2013, according to an Al-Ahram online newspaper report.

Moreover, neither side wants to admit they are partaking. Syrians here find such claims insulting, and Egyptian women don't want to admit that their men could find Syrians more attractive.

Some Muslim religious leaders have urged Egyptian men to marry Syrian women as an act of charity. There are even rumors that top members of the Muslim Brotherhood, the secretive religious society through which Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi rose to power, have taken Syrian women as second wives.

Earlier this month, the National Council of Women condemned the push to marry Syrian women, urging Egyptian officials to intervene. It even set up a hotline for Syrians to call and complain.

The number does not work.
