NORTH BETHESDA, Md. â€” Josiah Henson was a runaway slave whose story helped end slavery. Now, his old home is being turned into a museum.

Henson lived on a large farm not far from Washington, D.C. The story of his life inspired the book "Uncle Tom's Cabin." The farmhouse and a log cabin are still standing, but now they are on a busy street in the suburbs.

Henson escaped to Canada to be free. Writer Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote the character of Uncle Tom in her book based on him. "Uncle Tom's Cabin" told about the hard lives of slaves. It helped the movement to end slavery in the United States, which experts say was one of the causes of the Civil War.

## The New Park Will Be Named After Him

Many critics today do not like Stowe's book. They believe it puts down African-Americans.

But people are interested once again in the book and Josiah Henson. Officials in the county where the house was built bought the land. They will turn it into Josiah Henson Park. The house will become a museum.

The county officials think the log cabin was there when Henson lived on the farm. Scientists are not sure. Their tests show the cabin is not that old.

The officials were surprised. But they were not let down, said Shirl Spicer, the museum manager. They were excited to own the land that was related to Henson, she said as she took visitors around the house and grounds.

The main house was built when Henson lived there. Documents show the house and land belonged to Isaac Riley, Henson's owner. Scientists digging on the grounds have found objects from that time.

## Finally A Free Man

Henson was born in Maryland and lived to be 93 years old. He was sold to Riley when he was 6 years old and was reunited with his mother. As a young man, he gained Riley's trust. He supervised the farm and he sold vegetables at the market.

In 1825, Riley needed money. He sent Henson to take his slaves to Kentucky. They crossed Ohio, where slavery was illegal, but Henson would not run away or let the others go free.

Henson tried to buy his freedom later. But he found out that his owner had no plans to free him.

Henson knew he had to escape to be free. States in the North did not allow slavery. But escaped slaves caught in those states were returned to their owners. Henson would have to escape to Canada.

Henson and his family made it to Canada, where he opened a shelter for former slaves. Henson's son taught him to read and write, and he wrote the story of his life. The book was a hit and he became famous. He even met Queen Victoria of England in 1877.

## Many True Stories Came To Life

In Stowe's book, Uncle Tom suffers hard times. He is whipped to death because he would not help find runaway slaves.

Stowe also used the true stories of other slaves, said David S. Reynolds, an English professor. But Henson's story was the most important, he said. Henson was always proud to be the basis for Uncle Tom.

"Uncle Tom's Cabin" affected many people at the time.

President Abraham Lincoln met Stowe during the time of the Civil War. It is said that he told her: "So you're the little woman who wrote the book that started this great war!" Whether he really said those words has not been proven.
