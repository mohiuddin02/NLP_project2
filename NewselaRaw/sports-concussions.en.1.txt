College athletes who get through their sport's season concussion-free may not be completely in the clear, new research suggests.

Football and ice hockey players who had no outward signs of head injury showed worrisome changes in brain structure and mental performance following the season. Those changes weren't shared by athletes who competed in sports such as track, crew and cross-country skiing. The results are in a report published Wednesday in the journal Neurology.

The findings add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that a season-long succession of small hits may prompt changes in the brain. Those changes cause problems with memory, mood or mental performance years down the road. The changes come even though none of the individual hits are hard enough to cause a player to seem disoriented or to draw medical attention.

Or, they may heal during the off-season. Scientists are still trying to figure out how readily the brain recovers from injury. They also want to know whether there are limits beyond which damage can add up or be irreversible.

## A Matter Of White Matter

The new results don't resolve the matter. But they do suggest that repetitive blows to the head are not without consequence, even when an athlete is able to get up and keep playing, said study leader Thomas McAllister. He is a psychiatrist at Indiana University. Psychiatrists help treat mental problems.

"The management and detection of [concussion](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=concussions) is obviously important," McAllister said. "But may not be sufficient."

The study centered on 159 students at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H., who played on varsity teams between 2007 and 2011. Except for football, all of the sports were played by both men and women. McAllister worked at Dartmouth until last year.

The 80 athletes who played contact sports wore accelerometers in their helmets. The devices measured the number and force of blows to the head during all practices and games. In addition, all of the study participants got MRI brain scans and took mental performance tests before and after their seasons.

The researchers looked only at athletes who were not diagnosed with a concussion during the season they were tracked. They drew important connections between blows to the head and changes in brain structure as well as the students' mental performance weeks after their sport ended.

MRI measured the density and integrity of white matter in the brain. White matter are bundles of fatty tissue that speed electrical signals among neurons. The scans showed that after a single season, football and hockey players experienced changes that were greater than anything seen in the brains of the athletes who played noncontact sports. The players who had the biggest changes in white matter also had the worst performance on postseason tests of verbal learning and memory.

## Brain's Bounceback

McAllister said the good news was that despite years of playing their sports, the white matter of contact-sport athletes at the start of their seasons was largely the same as that of athletes in noncontact sports. That suggests the brains of college athletes may largely bounce back from a season's wear and tear.

But it will take far more research to determine whether there are certain athletes who don't heal as well. There could also be athletes for whom small changes in the brain structure can have large, and possibly delayed, effects.

"We know some of them heal. But some of them don't," said Eric Nauman, a professor at Purdue University. Nauman has spent five years tracking the effects of small and large hits in high school football.

MRIs aren't very good at picking up changes in white matter. That means the fact that differences were seen in the Dartmouth athletes is remarkable, Nauman said.

"If you're seeing structural changes at the level the MRI can pick up, that is very worrisome," said Nauman. "We're desperately trying to figure out what the long-term implications are." Nauman was not involved in the study

McAllister wants to find a line between hits that are safe, and hits that cause concussions. But years of study have made him suspect that if that line exists, it may tell only part of the story.

Well before they result in concussion, blows to the head change the brain's structure and the way it works, at least temporarily, he said. And there's growing evidence that a succession of those smaller hits puts players at higher risk for the one that finally leads to a concussion, McAllister said.

"You quickly see that the emphasis on 'the' hit is misplaced," he said.
