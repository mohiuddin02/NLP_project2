The Osprey aircraft arrived in Afghanistan almost four years ago with a bad reputation. Some said it was dangerous and hard to keep flying.

But now that the U.S. Marine Corps finally has had a chance to test it in combat, the reviews are a surprise. They are good.

"This is an ugly duckling that turned into a swan," said Richard Whittle, the author of a book about the Osprey.

The odd aircraft takes off and lands like a helicopter. It goes straight up and down. But then its engines rotate and it flies like an airplane across the sky.

It took more than 20 years to develop. It cost a lot more than planned. Thirty people died in crashes.

The U.S. military used it in Iraq from 2007 to 2009. There it mainly flew people and cargo. There was little fighting. Some people in the government called it wasteful.

## Winning Fans

The Marines have been able to use it more widely in Afghanistan. They have been flying it for everything from freight to fighting. It has carried loads of Marines into or out of landing zones under enemy fire. It is twice as fast as the helicopter it replaces. It can fly a lot farther.

Whittle once had his doubts about the Osprey. Now he has become a fan. "The Osprey has proven itself in Afghanistan in a way it did not in Iraq," he said. "Partly that was because it didn't get the chance in Iraq." He added that the military is usually very careful with new equipment. But if it can help in the fighting, the military will be quick to use it, Whittle explained.

The Ospreys here now are dusty, stained and smudged. At least five have returned to base with bullet holes.

Maj. Matthew McSorley pilots Ospreys for a Marine Corps squadron. He was hit by a different kind of fire while flying a mission on Valentine's Day: a massive bolt of lightning.

"It bounced right back, and I flew it all the way back, and within a week I was flying the same plane again," he said.

The Osprey showed its strengths in one recent mission.  A Marine with a head wound needed to be moved for quick treatment.

The crew dashed for the Osprey and zoomed some 40 miles. They picked up the wounded man and flew another 75 miles or so to the huge military base in Kandahar. This all took less than one hour from the moment they got the call.

## Avoiding Taliban Watchers

A regular helicopter would have had a hard time making just the 75-mile part of the trip as fast, Sanders said.

The Osprey is not made to be a flying ambulance, but speed is everything when someone is badly wounded. The Marines have been learning about all that the Osprey can do. And they're getting used to it, Whittle said.

One thing the Osprey was made for is for surprise attacks. The aircraft's speed and range allows it to come from behind a target, from an unexpected direction. This has helped the Marines against the enemy, the Taliban fighters.  The Taliban has a very basic air-warning system.  That system often is just a line of watchers with cellphones. It's no match for the Osprey.

That's why it's favored for special operations strikes here, Marines said.

The current model of the Osprey also is far safer than earlier ones. It is now among the safest rotary-wing aircraft in the military.

Still, the Osprey is expensive. They cost $122.5 million each, according to Sen. John McCain. The senator has complained about the cost for a long time. It also is not cheap to keep in good repair, especially in dusty places such as southern Afghanistan.

McCain said Osprey engines had been lasting just over 200 hours each. That is well below the 500 to 600 hours the Marines had expected. That more than doubled the cost per hour of flight, he said, compared with about $4,600 for the CH-46, a type of helicopter.

Osprey fans say the aircraft's say that higher cost is worth it since the plane can do more. They note that it can carry 24 passengers. The CH-46 can carry 10. Oh, and the Osprey flies twice as fast as that chopper.
