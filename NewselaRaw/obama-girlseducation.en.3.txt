WASHINGTON — Today, more than 60 million girls around the world are not in school. President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama announced this  week a new program that will try to help these girls get an education.

The program is called Let Girls Learn. It will join another program started last year by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).

## Education, Nutrition, Protection

The U.S. government already tries to help girls and young women around the world. Some areas include: education, leadership, nutrition and protection against violence.

"I want to make sure that no girl out there is denied her chance to be a strong, capable woman with the resources that she needs to succeed. That no girl is prevented from making her unique contributions to the world," President Obama said. "Every child is precious. Every girl is precious. Every girl deserves an education."

The president and first lady have two daughters — Sasha and Malia. This made the Obamas want to help other girls even more.

"I see myself in these girls. I see our daughters in these girls," Michelle Obama said. "I just can't walk away from them." Obama said she had to do something to help girls around the world achieve their dreams.

## Peace Corps Helps

The Peace Corps is one group that will help with the new program. The group is a volunteer program that was founded by the U.S. government in 1961. It sends Americans abroad to help people in poor countries.

Now, Peace Corps volunteers will look for barriers that prevent girls from finishing their educations. These include things like the cost of a uniform, school fees or a lack of textbooks. The Peace Corps has nearly 7,000 volunteers in more than 60 countries, according to its director, Carrie Hessler-Radelet. These volunteers already work with local communities though training programs, she said.

"Peace Corps volunteers are in a unique position to break down barriers to girls' education at the community level," Hessler-Radelet said. "They speak the local language. They understand the local culture."

## From Albania To Uganda

The girls education program will start with 11 countries the first year: Albania, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Georgia, Ghana, Moldova, Mongolia, Mozambique, Togo and Uganda. More countries will be included the following year, the White House said.

Michelle Obama will travel to Japan and Cambodia later this month as part of the program. She will meet with Akie Abe, Japan's first lady, and Caroline Kennedy, the U.S. ambassador to Japan. In Cambodia, she will meet with Peace Corps volunteers and visit a local school.

President Obama asked for $250 million for girls programs worldwide.

USAID already invests $1 billion each year in international education. The organization has helped train more than 300,000 teachers worldwide. It has provided more than 35 million textbooks and teaching materials in a single year, said Susan Markham, a USAID official who is in charge of women's issues.

"Access to education is one of the foremost challenges we face as a global community," Representative Kay Granger, a Republican from Texas, said at the White House on Tuesday.

## The Future They Deserve

Gayle Smith works with a U.S. government agency on international issues. She said improving education for girls helps a country become richer and can create more leaders for the future.

Smith pointed out the troubles of girls and women in places like Nigeria and Sudan. She said the program will also focus on the rights and safety of girls around the world.

Susan Rice advises the U.S. government on security issues. She said this program comes at an important time.

We cannot allow these difficulties to prevent young women from having an education, Rice said. "Together let's make sure that every child has a chance to forge the future that they deserve, starting with an education."

Michelle Obama said she hopes young people in the U.S. understand the "power of education." She wants U.S. students to learn about the difficulties girls around the world face in getting an education.
