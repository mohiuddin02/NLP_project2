BERLIN, Germany â€” Germany was ruled by the Nazis from 1933 until 1945. World War II was fought in part to overthrow them and to free the countries they had conquered.

As soon as the Nazis were defeated, their flags were torn down all over Germany. The symbols of Nazi rule disappeared almost overnight.

Nazi Germany fell in 1945. Exactly 80 years earlier, another government had also been defeated. In 1865, the Civil War brought an end to the Confederate States of America.

The Confederacy was formed by a group of Southern states that broke away from the United States. They separated from the North to protect their right to own black people as slaves. The Confederate flag was their symbol.

Confederate and Nazi symbols ended up being treated very differently.

## Nazi Signs Now Seen As Evil

Most Germans see the swastika and other Nazi symbols as something very evil. They call up memories of the Nazis' killing of 6 million Jewish people. They remind Germans that their country caused a world war that killed up to 70 million people. Nazi symbols are almost never seen outside of a museum. When they are shown, they are presented as pure evil.

In Germany after 1945, almost everything that would remind people of the Nazis was destroyed. Carved swastikas were ground off buildings. Statues of Nazis were torn down. Nazi officials were given unmarked graves. Until recently, the spot where Nazi leader Adolf Hitler killed himself was left as an unmarked parking lot. Wearing or displaying Nazi symbols has been against the law since 1949.

## Confederate Flag Shown With Pride

The Confederate battle flag was treated very differently. It found its way into graveyards and flag stands. It even became part of some official state flags. The flag itself has flown over the capitol buildings of several states.

Deidre Berger runs the American Jewish Committee office in Berlin. She says it is difficult to compare anything to the Holocaust, the Nazi mass killing that took 6 million Jewish lives. However, the symbols of the Holocaust and of slavery do share something in common, she said. They both stand for hate and for terrible crimes.

"They're symbols of a way of life that is completely unacceptable," she said. Germans quickly realized that it was very important to get rid of all Nazi symbols. Only by doing so could they once again become a nation worthy of respect.

Berger said Germany's outlawing of Nazi symbols has been important. It protects the victims and their children from being reminded of past horrors. Beyond that, hate groups are not able to use the symbols to attract new followers in Germany.

"It's important not to underestimate the power of symbols," she said.

## Millions Were Held As Slaves

Berger thinks it is unfortunate that what happened in Germany has not happened in the United States. "Americans made a different choice with the symbols of the Confederacy," she said.

Mark Potok studies hate groups in the United States. Potok praised South Carolina for recently voting to remove the Confederate flag from all official buildings. However, he added, "you could argue it was 150 years late" since the Civil War ended a long time ago.

Around 450,000 Africans were kidnapped in Africa and brought to what became the United States. Then generations of children were born to those captives. The members of each generation were slaves as well. By the time the Confederacy fell in 1865, somewhere around 11 million people had been held as slaves.

Confederate flag supporters say life was good in the Old South. They do not like to talk about the bad things, like slavery.

For German students, things are very different. They spend a part of each year studying the horrors of Nazi Germany. All students must visit at least one of the concentration camps where Jews were killed. The goal is to remind students that the stories of the Holocaust are not only real but happened nearby.
