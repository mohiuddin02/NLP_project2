JOHANNESBURG, South Africa â€” In July, a Zimbabwean lion called Cecil was killed by an American, sparking anger around the globe. The hunting industry responded to the outcry. It said that by killing animals, trophy hunters are actually saving Africa's wildlife.

Trophy hunting brings money to villages that badly need it, the industry argued. Hunters say that in turn, that makes the wild animals more valuable to local communities. Villagers might otherwise see lions as hated invaders that kill livestock and have to be killed at all costs, hunters insist. Although some wild animals are killed by hunters, greater numbers are saved, hunting groups said.

Yet some research suggests a different theory: Hunting has hidden consequences that have a far greater effect on lion populations than people realize.

## Anything For The Trophy

Craig Packer is the director of the Lion Research Center at the University of Minnesota. His research shows that over-hunting is the major reason for the steep decline in lion populations in Tanzania, the biggest lion-hunting country in Africa. At the root of the problem, he believes, is that trophy hunters prefer large male lions.

When a hunter kills a big male lion, other males fight and kill one another to become the leader, Packer said. The male lions might also kill off some cubs and attack females who defend them. In Tanzania, there are so few big, older males that hunters started killing younger lions.

"If you are shooting that many young males, it means you've shot all the big ones," Packer said. He called it a very efficient way to shrink the lion population.

Julian Rademeyer is the author of "Killing for Profit," a book about illegal hunting in southern Africa. He said professional hunters who guide foreign hunters face huge pressure to make sure that the foreign hunters go home with the big animals they are after. Professional hunters in Zimbabwe were arrested for their role in the death of Cecil. The well-known lion was killed by American dentist Walter Palmer from Minnesota.

"They will do pretty much anything to get your trophy. There's immense pressure on hunting outfits to get those trophies," Rademeyer said. Hunting rules are intended to limit the number of lions that are killed. In places where there is widespread corruption and regulations are not followed, "it just becomes a killing frenzy and that's what's happening in Zimbabwe," he said.

## Intensive Hunting Hurts Lion Populations

From 2002 to 2009, 1,363 dead lions were exported from Tanzania. The figure does not include the many lions that were killed after hunts were over. It also ignores the fact that fewer lion cubs were born because of hunts. According to Packer's research, intensive hunting has caused sharp declines in lion populations in Tanzania.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature is an environmental group based in Switzerland. It says that the number of lions in Tanzania fell 66 percent from 1993 to 2014.

A 2009 study by Packer and other scientists found that area with the most hunting showed the biggest population declines over the past 25 years. A 2011 study called for reducing the number of lions that could be killed each year. It said that "trophy hunting was the only significant factor" in the decline in male lions.

Packer's reports led the Tanzanian government to cut the number of hunts allowed each year, known as a quota. It also passed a law against shooting younger males. But he said the law has rarely been enforced because of widespread corruption in the industry.

## Some Lions Are Not Truly Wild

The global population of lions has dropped from 100,000 in the 1980s to an estimated 30,000.

Kenya banned hunting in 1977. Yet the lion population has dropped from 15,000 to about 2,000 in 15 years. The hunting industry says this demonstrates that hunting is not the problem. In Kenya, lions roam free and cattle herders kill them with poison to protect their cattle.

By contrast, South Africa has a big trophy-hunting industry popular with Americans. It has about 9,000 lions, nearly one-third of the global total. The Professional Hunters' Association of South Africa says that trophy hunts earn about $90 million each year.

However, only about 2,800 of South Africa's lions are wild. Nearly 70 percent are bred in cages, and are often used as cubs in petting zoos. They are then sold off to hunting companies. Foreign trophy hunters shoot the semi-tame lions inside fenced-in areas.

## Communities Don't See Much Hunt Money

Critics argue that trophy hunting brings little economic benefit to local communities.

"That's the biggest myth about sport hunting, that it gives value to lions," Packer said.

A 2013 study by the Australian group Economists at Large found that only 3 percent of the money spent by trophy hunters winds up in the hands of local people. Trophy hunting also did not bring much that much money to African countries, the study said. It made up only 1.2 percent of all tourism money in South Africa and 2.3 percent in Tanzania.

"Across Africa, local communities receive minimal benefit from trophy hunting," the report said.
