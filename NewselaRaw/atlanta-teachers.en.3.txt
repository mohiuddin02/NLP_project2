ATLANTA â€” Eleven former Atlanta teachers and administrators were found guilty of cheating and might have to go to prison for decades.

The teachers, principals and their bosses changed student test scores to make the district look better. The higher scores earned them extra money and pay raises.

On Wednesday afternoon, 10 former teachers and school administrators were handcuffed and taken to jail. They will be sentenced later. The 11th teacher was at home because she is about to have a baby.

Only one former teacher, Dessa Curb, was found innocent. She walked out of the courthouse a free woman.

"I knew God had my back," she said.

## Teachers Erased Wrong Answers

In total, 32 former educators were convicted in the test-cheating scandal. The number includes 21 teachers and educators who pleaded guilty before the trial started last year. Former Superintendent Beverly Hall had been charged in the case. However, she and another died of cancer before the trial began.

Paul Howard is the Fulton County District Attorney, a lawyer who argued against the teachers in the case. On Wednesday, he said he hoped the jury's decision would lead to a close look at Atlanta's education system and how the cheating happened in the first place. Howard had been criticized for bringing charges against teachers.

During the trial, several teachers described how the cheating worked. They said that after students finished taking standardized tests, teachers secretly erased the wrong answers and replaced them with the right ones. Their changed tests made it seem like the students knew more than they did. Based on the false results, students were often passed on to the next grade although they couldn't read, write or do basic math.

## Students Also Suffered

The teachers did not just cheat the system. They cheated the students. The fake test scores made schools miss out on money from the government that could have paid for tutoring or other programs to help students catch up. Howard and his team said the lost money totaled $8 million in 2009 alone.

The case began in 2008, when the Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper raised questions about the high test scores. The state began looking at the test answer sheets. It found that too many wrong answers were erased and replaced with correct answers.

Students in a fourth-grade class at Dobbs Elementary School had a 1 in 288 septillion chance of doing as well as they seemed to do. A septillion is a one followed by 24 zeros.

Special investigators interviewed hundreds of Atlanta Public Schools employees. A report released in 2011 found that cheating was widespread. The investigators found that thousands of schoolchildren were not getting the education they deserved.

## Critic Says Jailing Teachers Won't Heal City

Howard's team said the district's superintendent demanded constantly improving test scores. She was honored nationally as the scores rose. If students got bad test scores, teachers were fired and embarrassed.

"I have always felt the whole thing was tragic," said Erroll Davis, who replaced Hall as superintendent.

Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed hoped the court case would allow Atlanta to finally get over the cheating scandal.

Richard Quartarone is a father of two children in an Atlanta school. He said the teachers being sent to jail will not heal his city. Howard and his team said cheating had gone on for years. Thousands of children in that time did not receive a good education.

## Little Sympathy From Judge

Fulton County Judge Jerry Baxter made it clear he will show little sympathy to the convicted teachers.

They have been found guilty of serious crimes, Baxter said. Baxter added that he does not like to send teachers to jail, but the teachers chose to do the wrong thing.

After hearing the jury's decision, the educators did not appear emotional at first. But some grew upset when Baxter ordered them to jail.

Gerald Griggs is the lawyer of Angela Williamson, a former teacher who told students the correct answers during testing. He said she whispered to him that she could not believe she had been convicted on all five charges against her. She faces 40 years, the most time of all the convicted teachers.

## End Of A Sad And Tragic Chapter

Griggs said he respected the jurors' decision. Still he asked, "How do you send teachers to prison?"

The Atlanta school system called the case a "sad and tragic chapter" that is now over. It said that the new superintendent and the school board are working together to change the school system.
