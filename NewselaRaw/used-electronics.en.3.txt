More and more people are deciding to sell their old cellphones after they buy a new one.

Best Buy Co. Inc. launched a trade-in program in 2009 for things like cellphones, video games and the computers to play them on. It's gotten more popular every year, and now Best Buy is accepting more than 11,000 different devices. The number of devices traded in "has doubled every year since 2009," Jeff Shelman, a Best Buy spokesman, wrote in an email.

The numbers keep growing as well at Pawn America's 29 Midwest stores. In 2013, sales of used cellphones were up by more than one-tenth. Tablets sales increased by two times.

The secondhand market for electronics is "super-hot," said Karl Hattman of Pawn America. People who want cellphones or video games "are more accepting of buying secondhand goods," he said.

## Unloading The Old

Fortunately for bargain hunters, there are also plenty of people who want the latest and greatest technology. They are willing to get rid of a phone from a year or two ago. With the value of the devices ranging from $50 to $200 or more, they aren't sitting forgotten in a drawer anymore.

People are now getting new smartphones every 12 to 18 months. It's less often for tablets and laptops, said Louis Ramirez at DealNews.com.

People with cellphones, computers and video games are adapting as well. They are trying to keep their devices in  good shape, and keep the original box and manual, Ramirez said. They've learned that they get more money or credit for them if they want to sell them.

People have a lot of choices to unload their old, but not too old, technology. Pawnshops have been a popular go-to for many years. Retailers such as Best Buy, Target, Wal-Mart and Radio Shack have gotten into the act as well. They offer store credit in exchange for used electronics online or in stores.

Many websites, such as Gazelle.com, BuyBackWorld.com and Nextworth.com, will pay money to people who mail in used devices.  As a result, companies such as Usell.com have popped up to list bids from several resellers.

## 600 Offers A Second

Anthony Scarsella, who's in charge of gadgets or cool devices for Gazelle.com, gave an example. He recalled when Apple CEO Tim Cook debuted the iPhone 5S and 5C models. Within an hour, Gazelle began getting 600 offers a second on earlier models.

Manufacturers are joining in because they can resell the old devices. Apple offers store credit while Samsung offers a Visa card with money on it. "Why let Amazon take their lunch" when manufacturers can buy these devices directly from those who own them?" Ramirez said.

One retailer is going a step further. NYT Franchise Co. in Wayzata, Minn., just opened Device Pitstop in Minnetonka, Minn. It buys and sells used and refurbished smartphones, laptops, tablets and all-in-one computers from brands including Apple, Android, Acer, Compaq, Dell, HP, IBM, Sony and Toshiba. Laptop prices range from $99 to $500. Tablets go from $159 to $400, and smartphones from $100 to $300.

The retailer offers a number of services, doing repairs, upgrades and servicing. Workers inspect devices in the store. They make common repairs such as fixing cracked screens in the store, usually within a few days.

A lot of people think small electronics can't be fixed and they can't sell them, said Dave Brennan. He teaches people how to run good businesses. But many people are starting to realize that even a tablet with a cracked screen may have value.

## Repairs And Warranties

Brennan said retailers need to make customers feel safe about buying used devices. They should hire workers who know a lot about electronics. And they should offer some sort of a warranty. Businesses that sell cars are now offering warranties and cars that are guaranteed to have been checked to make sure they are in good shape, Brennan said.

People want to know that if they buy something used, any problems will be taken care of. Device Pitstop includes a 90-day warranty on all products, said Mike Smith. He is one of the heads of the company.

Terri Harris took her work iPad into Device Pitstop to find out how much it would cost to fix a cracked screen. "I didn't even know if it was possible," said Harris, of Maple Plain, Minn. "I've had clear tape holding it together for a year."

For $150 the crack could be repaired. But Harris had to check with her boss to see if it was OK.

Device Pitstop is a franchised retailer with seven stores in Las Vegas, Phoenix and Lexington, Ky. Smith said the company hopes to add 300 nationwide within five years.

Smith is confident the used electronics market will continue to grow. "It used to be young males, but now we're getting an older demographic and families, too," he said. "They like being able to see and test used items in person, and getting a warranty. You won't get that on eBay."
