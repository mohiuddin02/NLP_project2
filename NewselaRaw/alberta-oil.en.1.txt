FORT CHIPEWYAN, Canada â€” A hundred miles up the Athabasca River, the forest has been leveled by enormous strip mines. Massive shovels pick up 100 tons of earth at a time and dump it into yellow trucks as big as houses.

The dirt contains a fortune in oil.

Oil sands production, as the process is called, is booming in Alberta, Canada. It has enriched local indigenous Indian villages and provides jobs for thousands of people in places where work is scarce. But there are fears that the oil sands production is polluting the environment and damaging people's health.

## "Either We Starve To Death Or Are Poisoned"

The indigenous Native Indians face a terrible dilemma.

"From everything I hear from the indigenous peoples, their thinking seems to be 'It's a choice between whether we starve to death or are poisoned to death,'" said John O'Connor, a local doctor who has worked here since 1993.

In the Cree language, "athabasca" means "a place where grass is everywhere." In Alberta, the Athabasca River slices through forests of spruce and birch before spilling into Lake Athabasca.

The oil-filled sands mined on the banks of the Athabasca River are shipped to refineries to be processed into gasoline and other fuels, but the polluted leftovers remain in miles-long landfills. Air cannons fire to keep migratory birds from landing on the toxic ponds.

Oil sands production is expected to grow far larger if the U.S. government issues a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline from the province.

Debate in the U.S. over the pipeline has mainly focused on whether the oil sands contribute to [climate change](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming) or spills along the route. But in northeastern Alberta, the effect of the oil sands is more complicated.

In Fort Chipewyan, cancer and diseases such as lupus have taken a heavy toll on its mostly indigenous Cree, Dene and Metis Indian population. In 2009, the government found that cancer rates over a 12-year period were 30 percent higher than normal.

Three weeks ago, government scientists told villagers they had found toxic levels of mercury in the eggs of migratory birds downstream from oil sands production. Fishermen say fish in the lake show bulging eyes and other deformities.

Three independent studies show rising concentrations of pollutants, including those that cause cancer, in nearby waterways.

## Officials Say They're Playing It Safe

Industry officials and the Alberta government insist the chemicals occur naturally.

They also say they are taking safety precautions to protect communities. Some of the indigenous people, known as the First Nations, have hunted and fished here for thousands of years.

The oil industry is funding a government-run system to monitor possible pollution. Efforts to restore the land, meanwhile, can take years, if not decades. Of the thousands of acres mined over 40 years, only 247 acres have been restored.

"We will be here another 50 to 60 years," said Greg Stringham, vice president for oil sands for the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.

Canada already is the largest exporter of crude oil to the United States, mostly from oil sands. Officials hope to increase production by 2030 to about 5 million barrels a day. Currently, production is 1.9 million barrels. Many of the world's biggest oil companies lease land along the Athabasca River and other parts of eastern Alberta.

The Keystone XL pipeline, the most efficient way to ship oil, is crucial to the effort. Some local residents fear the pipeline would hasten development of the oil sands and create additional pollution.

## Environmental Damage

Beginning in the 1990s, commercial fisherman "Big Ray" Ladouceur began catching fish with deformities from Lake Athabasca, he said. The cause is unknown, but since 2009, studies have warned about water pollution linked to oil sands development.

A January 2013 study on lakes near oil sand mines showed increased contamination and ecological change, said Joshua Kurek of Queen's University in Ontario and lead author of the study.

The government has exempted the oil industry from policies to protect wetlands.

Cal Dallas, Alberta's minister of international and intergovernmental relations, insisted that oil companies are held accountable.

Out of 4,000 possible violations of environmental regulations from 1996 to 2012, Alberta authorities took actions in 37 cases, according to a July report.

## A Two-Sided Issue

Yet with jobs scarce, some indigenous groups have made their peace with industry and the government.

For years, the village at Fort MacKay fought each oil sands project, and lost. But by the 1990s, the village began to work with the industry to have a say in its expansion.

"It's like sleeping next to a huge elephant," said Jim Boucher, chief of the Fort McKay First Nation. "At the end of the day, we have to make the best of it."

When the wind blows from the south, Fort MacKay reeks of tar. But the village has reaped millions of dollars and is building a new youth center, church and theater. Homes are being built in the hills above the village; residents drive Cadillacs and own teepees.

In Fort Chipewyan, a youth center downtown is named for an oil company. Residents there fear the effect of oil sands development, but are resigned that it is inevitable.

Alice Rigney, 62, a lifelong resident, wonders whether her breast cancer was related to mining pollutants. She would like to see the waste ponds cleaned up, but she says she's also realistic: The wages the oil company is offering are too good for Canadians to turn down.

"I don't think we can win. I don't even know what winning looks like," said Rigney, who teaches the Dene language. "This oil is just too important for the rest of Canada."
