MEXICO CITY â€” When tax time comes, artist Teresa Cito doesn't worry. She knows the government isn't after a single peso.

Instead, what the taxman wants is one of her artworks. Governments take part of what people make each year. The money goes to help pay for the government.

In Mexico, artists have an unusual choice: They are allowed to give works of art to the government instead of money.

The idea, which is known as Payment in Kind, dates back to 1957. It has helped the government build a huge collection of modern art. It has also left artists such as Cito happy: They don't have to fill out tax forms. They also don't have to worry about owing the government money.

## The Government Says "Keep On Painting"

The number of works artists must give changes from year to year: It depends on how many pieces they have sold in a year. No artist, though, is made to give more than six works a year.

Cito paints colorful oil paintings, as well as chalk drawings on paper. She doesn't try to give the government works of low quality. She knows whatever she gives will be exhibited. It may end up in a government building or a museum. It may even be shown in another country.

Cito said she always tries to offer the government "a nice piece." She had high praise for the Payment in Kind program. "I admire it very, very, very much. The government says, 'Pay your taxes in artwork. Keep on painting.'"

Almost every artist who takes part in the program agrees.

"I think it's fantastic," said artist Naomi Siegmann. The works she has given can be seen "all over the country." They have shown up in "government offices as well as public buildings."

Siegmann said she was thrilled to see one of her pieces in a public space.

"I walk in and see my work," Siegmann said, and "I think, 'How nice!'"

She added, "Every big artist is in this program. I mean the top, top artists. It's not just the new artists, the beginners."

## Let's Make An Art Deal

The program came out of a 1957 meeting between two men: tax official Hugo B. Margain and artist David Alfaro Siqueiros. Siqueiros told Margain that an artist friend was in trouble: He was facing jail time for not paying his taxes.

Siqueiros argued that "a painter knows nothing" about "tax law," Margain later wrote. "The only thing we have," Siqueiros said, "are pictures." Perhaps, he suggested, artists could give the government artworks instead of money.

"It doesn't seem like a bad idea, I told him," Margain wrote.

The idea was soon accepted by the Mexican government. Since then, it has taken in more than 4,000 works of art.

The program has created a splendid collection of artworks. In addition, it has helped beautify many public buildings.

## A Huge Art Collection

The program does have one problem, though: Some of the art the government gets isn't very good. Bad artists, too, have a right to take part in the program.

Still, the government's collection contains many great works. They come from some of Mexico's most famous artists.

What's more, artists try to give work they're proud of.

Artists know "their pieces may be exhibited," said government official Jose San Cristobal Larrea. They try to give some of their best work.

San Cristobal said the government is careful not to judge the work it gets. After all, great artistic talent can't always be spotted immediately.

"Artists who aren't important today might be important tomorrow," he said.
