CHICAGO â€” Kathryn Dungan is slow to speak and express herself. It's been a challenge for her. Kids like her have special needs.

The Rising Stars Buddy Baseball program in Wheaton, Illinois, tries to help young people with special needs. The program lets kids like Dungan play sports. Kids without special needs help them out. The program matches them together. Then they play together on the field.

Nicole Giambalvo was matched with Dungan. Giambalvo tried to speak with her during the buddies' first several meetings. It wasn't working. Dungan stayed quiet.

At the time, Dungan was 13. She was shy. She liked nail polish and Disney princesses. Baseball didn't interest her.

## Giggling In The Outfield

Giambalvo came up with a plan. She would pretend they were princesses, not baseball players. She listened to how Dungan spoke with her parents and two brothers. Then she tried to speak with her like they did. It worked! It got her to talk.

Today, Giambalvo and Dungan are both 18. They've been friends for five years. Now, they meet once a week to play. They hold hands as Giambalvo leads Dungan to first base after she has a hit. Then, while waiting to make a catch, they giggle together in the outfield.

The girls also hang out off the field. They go swimming. They even went to a Taylor Swift concert together.

The number of "buddy" sporting programs is growing. Supporters say the programs teach young people. They help kids without special needs understand people who have trouble learning.

Special Olympics Unified Sports has games all over the world. Thousands of athletes take part. It puts athletes with special needs on the same fields as other athletes.

## All About Having Fun

In Wheaton, the Buddy Baseball program is now in its 23rd year. Buddies and players are surrounded by family and friends. They cheer them on.

The games are more about having fun than keeping score.

MK Dungan is Kathryn's mother. It makes her happy to see Kathryn enjoying the baseball games. Kathryn even talks about it for days beforehand.

Some pairs have been together for years. They return home from college and jobs to be back on the field with their old friend.

Giambalvo is now at college. She wants to keep returning each summer to spend time with Dungan. Giambalvo now counts her among her closest friends.

"She's taught me probably more than I've taught her," Giambalvo said.
