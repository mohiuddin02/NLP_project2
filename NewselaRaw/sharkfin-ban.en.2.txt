LOS ANGELES — An ancient Asian dining tradition came to an end in California on Monday. Grocer Emily Gian did not like it.

Gian cut prices on shark fins, the expensive ingredient of a soup eaten on special occasions. She hoped to sell out before California's ban on shark fins began.

"The law is unfair," said Gian, whose store in Los Angeles' Chinatown had sold shark fins for $599 a pound. "Why single out Chinese people in California when shark fins are legal in many other states?"

Across town, retired science teacher Judy Ki offered an answer.

Ki grew up in a wealthy Hong Kong family. On special occasions like birthdays, banquets and weddings they served steaming bowls of shark fin soup to honor guests. These days Ki, a spokeswoman for the Asian Pacific American Ocean Harmony Alliance, sees the expensive food differently.

## Millions Killed For Their Fins

Shark fin soup dates to the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). Then, they were reserved for emperors as a symbol of the emperor's importance and power. At the time, it was hard for a fisherman to kill a shark. For that reason, shark fin was "the ultimate symbol of yang, or male energy," said Ki.

It wasn't prized for its flavor. It hardly had any. People liked that it was soft and tender. For flavor, cooks often added chicken or ham.

As China's middle class grew in recent decades, many more people were able to afford the delicacy. To meet growing demand, the fishing industry harvested several million fins each year by slicing them off the sharks and throwing the crippled animals back into the sea to drown.

An estimated 73 million sharks are killed each year for their fins. In California, fins can sell for more than $2,000 a pound. The populations of some shark species, such as hammerheads, have been reduced by as much as 90 percent in recent years.

Ki finds that morally wrong. "It is not right to slaughter massive numbers of sharks for a bowl of soup that lasts five minutes," Ki said. "Culture evolves. [Extinction](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species) lasts forever." Once a species disappears, in other words, it never comes back.

## Ban Called Unfair

Gian and others said the ban was unfair. They said shark fins could still be sold in other states.

California, and supporters of the ban, said they hope that will change.

Aimee David, director of conservation policy at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, pointed out that California's new legislation may be the beginning of a trend. "California's example has inspired several states to act."

So far, Hawaii, Washington, Oregon, Illinois, Maryland and Delaware have enacted legislation prohibiting the sale of shark fins. So have the Pacific territories Guam, American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands. New York is currently pursuing similar legislation.

Korean Airlines and Cathay Pacific Airways have stopped carrying shark fins as cargo. China's government has announced that it will stop serving shark fins at official events within three years.

Despite protests from some Chinese American leaders, California Governor Jerry Brown outlawed the sale of shark fins 18 months ago. Stores were only given permission to sell what they already had in stock. On Monday, that became illegal. Those who break the new law could be jailed for up to six months. They could also be fined up to $1,000.

## Cutting Prices Before The Ban

Some San Francisco merchants claimed that the ban was unconstitutional and unfair to the Chinese. A group of them asked the federal court to overturn the law. In January, the court found that California had the right to outlaw the sale of shark fins. This decision was based on evidence that the decline of sharks threatened the health of the oceans.

Shops were selling right up to the ban. Wing Hop Fung Ginseng &amp; China Products had three bins of dried shark fins left. One was marked with a sign: "Father's Day Special! 20 percent off. $999 a pound."

At the nearby Ocean Seafood, shark fin soup now costs $42 a bowl. Manager Dennis Fong said the restaurant was changing its menus this week to remove the item.

Some Chinese restaurants were trying to come up with an imitation shark fin soup by using more common seafood.

"Maybe we'll reduce the prices even more, or eat them ourselves, or maybe move them to a state where they are still legal," said Gian.
