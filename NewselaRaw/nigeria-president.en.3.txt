KADUNA, Nigeria — It is a historic moment for Nigeria. For the first time in 16 years of democracy, a candidate from a political group opposed to the government has defeated the current president. On Tuesday, longtime candidate Muhammadu Buhari was declared the winner of Nigeria's presidential elections.

This will not be Buhari's first time as leader of Nigeria, Africa's richest and most heavily populated nation. He was once the country's dictator — a ruler with total power — until being overthrown in 1985.

Buhari, 72, will face major difficulties as president. The country's northeast is being attacked by a rebel group known as Boko Haram. Poverty is widespread, and many government officials are corrupt and will take money in return for favors.

## Retired General, Former Dictator

President Goodluck Jonathan called his rival to congratulate him Tuesday night. His friendly call could help limit post-election violence that has been a problem in years past. About 1,000 people were killed during fights over the 2011 presidential contest.

The election of a former dictator might not seem like good news for a democratic country. However, Buhari seems to offer what many Nigerians have been asking for. He is a retired general who has promised a large-scale campaign against Boko Haram. He also has a plan to end widespread corruption.

Buhari has run for president four times in the past 12 years, but before now never came close to winning.

Here in the northern state of Kaduna, people celebrated in the streets. They danced, performed tricks on their motorcycles and screamed, "We need change." They listed what they hope will happen now that their political group had finally won.

"Boko Haram will be defeated," said Bello Mohammed, 30.

"Buhari will take care of unemployment," said Nurudeen Mukhtar, 27.

## "Not Like The Corrupt Guys"

Buhari has lived in Kaduna for around 30 years, since his military government was overthrown. His simple two-story home was dark Tuesday night, but a guard invited a journalist to walk around.

"Look at that old car — that's his only car," said Sergeant Garba Abdullahi. "He is a man of the people, not like the corrupt guys."

It probably will be very difficult for Buhari to bring about rapid reform.

"Nigerians expect to see immediate change. They expect to see corruption end right away," political expert Idayat Hassan said. However, "corruption is a way of life," so change will probably be slow, Hassan said.

During his rule from 1984 to 1985, Buhari attempted to crack down on corruption and other crimes. He set up military courts that sentenced hundreds to prison. Some viewed his actions as necessary, but many others considered them too harsh. He also heavily controlled newspaper, radio and television news.

## Prepared To Fight Boko Haram

Buhari says he has changed in the years since he was dictator. He has traded his military uniform for a traditional flowing robe and he now says he believes in democracy.

Buhari has strongly criticized Jonathan for failing to defeat Boko Haram. The rebel group has grown steadily since 2009 and has killed at least 10,000 people. Buhari has said that as "a military man" he is well prepared to take on the rebels.

Jonathan surprised many here when he accepted defeat without a fight. The election was postponed for nearly two months, raising fears that Jonathan might cheat his way to reelection.

In the end, there was little or no cheating. Jonathan declared that all Nigerians should "graciously accept" the election outcome.
