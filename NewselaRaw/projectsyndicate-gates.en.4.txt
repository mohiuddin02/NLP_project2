SEATTLE, Wash. â€“ A few years ago, my wife Melinda and I visited a group of rice farmers in Bihar, India. It is a part of India that gets hit hard by floods. The farmers there were very poor. They depend on the rice they grow to feed their families. Each year, powerful monsoon rains arrive. The rivers rise higher. Farms are flooded.

Often, their crops are ruined. The farmers must leave their farms. They move to the cities to find jobs to feed their families. By the next year, they return to plant again.

The visit showed us what life is like for the world's poorest farmers. They do not have the tools farmers in rich countries have. They do not have the best seeds. Poor farmers do not have fertilizer to make their plants grow. They do not have irrigation systems to water their plants.

## A Warming Climate Brings New Dangers

Now, climate change adds a new danger. The planet is warming. Temperatures will rise in the future. Farming could be hurt. It could be worst in hot places. Some crops will not grow because of too little rain. Too much rain could wreck crops too. Insects will grow like crazy in the warmer climate and destroy crops.

Farmers in rich countries will face changes, too. Yet they have the right tools. The world's poorest farmers could hurt the most.

At the same time, the world needs their help. The number of people in the world is growing quickly. The need for food will go up too. If famers cannot grow enough food, people could go hungry.

## The Poorest Need The Most Help

I am hopeful. I think we can handle climate change and feed the world. We must act now. Countries must develop cleaner energy. We must stop using so much coal, oil and gas. Using those fuels makes the temperature go up. Yet, it's already too late to stop some problems from hotter temperatures. That is why the poorest need help to get ready.

They will need the right tools. They need money, better seeds, fertilizer and training.

Other tools are new. New seeds are being made. The seeds will grow even during droughts or flooding. The rice farmers I met in Bihar are now growing a new type of rice. They call it "scuba" rice. It can survive two weeks underwater. They are ready for the floods. Other types of rice are being developed to withstand drought, heat, cold and soil problems.

## The Right Tools Can Make A Difference

With the right tools, farmers can grow more and make more money. The extra money can help them eat better, fix up their farms and send their children to school.

I know the world has what it takes to fix this problem. Most importantly, I know the farmers do, too.
