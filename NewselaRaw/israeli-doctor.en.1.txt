Along the way, he stopped to accept a pain pill from one nurse and a high-five from another.

He has been here for a month, ever since a Syrian government warplane flew low over his village and dropped a bomb that blew apart his lower limbs.

Both legs had been amputated by an overworked Syrian doctor in an improvised clinic in a cellar. The next day, the boy's grandmother took him to the Golan Heights border half an hour away and asked the Israeli soldiers on the other side for help.

As civil war rages in Syria, with an estimated 130,000 people killed and millions displaced after nearly three years of fighting, Israel has been quietly providing aid to some of the wounded. Since the effort was launched by the Israeli army, officials say, more than 700 Syrians have received treatment.

## Stream Of Wounded Syrians

The endeavor has cost about $17 million so far, officials say, and has been praised as a triumph of humanitarianism over geopolitical concerns. After all, Israel and Syria are bitter foes that have fought three bloody wars.

"We are saving the lives of our enemies," said Col. Tarif Bader, chief medical officer for the Israel Defense Forces Northern Command.

The 9-year-old boy is one of 17 Syrians being treated at Rebecca Sieff Hospital in Safed, a mountain outpost in northern Israel. Located about 5 miles west of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, Safed is roughly 25 miles west of the Syrian war zone.

The stream of wounded Syrians has changed the feel in the hospital's wards and especially the lives of its Arabic-speaking staff.

A social worker named Fares was in the hospital last February when the first group of Syrian patients arrived. An Arab Christian, he was asked to interpret. Since then, he has worked nearly around the clock as a counselor, interpreter and messenger for the more than 300 Syrian patients who have been treated at the hospital.

Fares, who is 36, asked to be identified by only his first name, as he fears the hospital's treatment of Syrians may attract hostility. He was in the emergency room when the 9-year-old, a skinny kid with long eyelashes, was brought in. The boy cried for two days, at times shouting in panic that he didn't have money to pay for the medical treatment.

He is doing better now, staff members say, thanks in part to the bond he has forged with Fares.

## "They Tell Me About Fighting"

On a recent afternoon, the pair sat together on the floor of the crowded ward for wounded children. Fares played along as the boy and one of his cousins, who also lost a leg in the bomb attack, threw a red plastic ball repeatedly against his head. The kids hung on him as he talked, grabbing at his big hands.

Most of those treated here are men. Although the staff doesn't ask about their loyalties, it is assumed that they are rebel fighters in the opposition Free Syrian Army or other rebel groups who can't seek medical treatment in Syrian government hospitals. None of those cared for in Israel have worn Syrian army uniforms.

The men are kept together in two rooms guarded by Israeli soldiers. "They tell me about fighting," Fares said, "and about killing, also."

Israel's border with Syria has been mostly quiet since the end of the 1973 war, in which Syria tried unsuccessfully to recover the Golan Heights. This territory had been lost to Israel six years earlier. A United Nations peacekeeping force now patrols in trucks and tanks along a newly built metal fence on the eastern border of the Heights.

On the Israeli-controlled side, cows graze in pastures, farmers tend to apple orchards and families drive down well-paved streets lined with modern shopping centers. To the east, Syrian government forces loyal to President Bashar Assad battle rebels with the Free Syrian Army and other groups, including some affiliated with al-Qaida.

## Gratitude For The Israelis

The Syrian government has control of the only official border crossing into the Heights, at Quneitra; other stretches are held by rebels.

Explosions can be heard and clouds of smoke seen from the top of Bental Mountain in the Heights.

Israel has condemned Assad for using chemical weapons and has occasionally targeted weapons transfers from the Syrian government to Hezbollah, a Lebanese militia and political party that Israel went to war against in 2006. Otherwise, it has remained on the sidelines — except for the medical assistance.

The grandmother of the 9-year-old with no legs said she has only gratitude for the Israelis.

In a few days, she and her grandson will be driven to the border at the east end of the Golan Heights to be dropped off. He has been fitted with two prosthetic limbs that were donated, via Fares, by a Muslim citizen of Safed. If all goes well, the boy may be able to walk again, though he will probably never play soccer, his favorite sport.

When asked what going back will be like, the woman, 63 and dressed in a simple black velvet caftan, threw her hands into the air. She said she didn't know whether the family had a home to return to.
