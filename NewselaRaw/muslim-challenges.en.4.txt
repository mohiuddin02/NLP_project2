PITTSBURGH — It is Friday at the Islamic Center of Pittsburgh. Many people have come to hear the weekly sermon. The center is also a mosque. It is a place where Muslims gather to pray.

Volunteers are asking people to help out at the mosque. It runs many programs. There is free food for poor people, activities for children, and education for grown-ups.

Many Muslims here are thinking about the violent attack in France earlier this month. The men who killed French journalists there said they were Muslims. They killed people at the Charlie Hebdo paper in Paris. The men were angry because of cartoons showing the Muslim Prophet Muhammad.

## Mosque Leaders Say Enough Violence

Leaders at this mosque in Pennsylvania hope to fight back against violent groups. They will not fight them physically. They are fighting against the hate that is being spread.

Today, there are some violent groups around the world who say they are Muslims. There are the men who killed journalists in Paris. There is Boko Haram in Nigeria. In Iraq and Syria, the Islamic State group, also called ISIS or ISIL, is killing people. Al-Qaida plans attacks around the world. It was the group behind the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks in the United States.

Here in Pittsburgh, some Muslims are sending a different message.

## Education Is The Best Way

Esra Daghestani is 29. She was recruiting volunteers to work with children. She studied nursing at Duquesne University.

"Everything that's going on around the world is sad," she said. "The best thing you can do is try to help with the generation that's coming now."

She added, "It's important to tell the youth that ISIS and al-Qaida aren't really related to Islam. They're just people who use the name of Islam to get attention."

Sheikh Atef Mahgoub is the imam of the mosque. An imam is a Muslim religious leader. He is like a priest and leads prayers. In his weekly sermon, he had strong words for the Paris attackers.

The men "were not defending the honor of Islam," Mahgoub said. "They did exactly the opposite."

He said, "Muslims all over the world are suffering because of this. Innocent people were killed."

More education is needed, he said. It is the best way to fight back against groups who call for violence.

## Cartoons Upset Many

The Prophet Muhammad never responded to an insult with violence, Mahgoub said.

Muslims who really want to defend Islam should live by what Muhammad taught, he said. They should show mercy and gentleness.

Muslims do not show Muhammad in pictures. Islam says believers should only worship God, not a picture showing God.

Charlie Hebdo printed cartoons showing the Prophet Muhammad. The paper also showed him in very negative ways.

The cartoons offended many Muslims. Mahgoub said this is understandable, but it does not make violence OK.

## Mosque Activities Are Helpful

These Muslims in Pennsylvania are fighting a battle of ideas with violent groups. One of these violent groups is the Islamic State. The Islamic State produces propaganda — articles and videos with its violent message. Then it puts them online.

Niaz Khan is 23. He recently graduated from the University of Pittsburgh. He wants to become a doctor.

He said young Muslims are working to fight against this propaganda by bringing their friends into mosque activities. The mosque has a study room for students. Many of the food-bank volunteers are students.

At the mosque, young people can learn what Islam really teaches, Khan said. The biggest message: you must forgive your enemies.
