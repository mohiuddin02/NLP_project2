LOS ANGELES â€” Yosemite High School once offered six wood shop classes. Now there are three.

Things got worse when a new high school opened close by. Many students transferred. The number of students is down from 1,100 five years ago to about 700 today.

School officials are now looking to a faraway place for help. As soon as next fall, Yosemite High in California could welcome 25 students from China. They would pay $10,000 or more each year in education costs. The students would bring money and give an international flavor to a school with few families from other countries.

Two Chinese students are at Yosemite High this year. Xiao "Travis" Ma of Inner Mongolia plays clarinet in the marching band. Chengyu "Johnny" Zhang of Shanghai is on the running team. Though the Chinese food here isn't how they'd like it, they appreciate the clean air and the extra space they have at the school, which is set near mountains.

## An International Flavor

Having students who pay "helps keep some of our programs more full," said Stephanie Samuels. She is a counselor for students at Yosemite High. She said the students in her school benefit from meeting people from other parts of the world.

Minarets High is the new school near Yosemite. It will soon cash in too. There are 20 Chinese students set to go there in January who will pay $10,000 each year.

High schools in Maine and New York are also looking overseas to fill seats. The number of tuition-paying foreign students in American public high schools has risen sharply. There were a few hundred nationwide in 2007. But last year there were nearly 3,000.

Newly rich families are eager to educate their children in the West. Letting in students from China has become the latest way for public schools to get money.

The foreign students have raised concerns about the work of private companies that find students.

Steven Dorsey manages the international student program at Walnut Valley. He gets lost of calls from companies looking to bring over Chinese students.

"I have people saying, 'I can get you 100 students right now.' No, I don't want 100 students," Dorsey said. "I want to see that this is a great place to study and a good experience for kids when they come over."

## From Public To Private Schools

In addition to finding students, the companies serve as a link between parents and schools. They also set up the students' living arrangements.

There are also worries about their safety. They are teenagers in the country without their parents.

"There's so much money that can be made," said Jay Chen. He is president of a local school board. He says because there aren't a lot of rules, companies may be "driven by profit rather than the desire to provide students and schools with a quality experience."

Most students from foreign countries who pay for school here still study at private high schools. There were 62,000 last year, up from about 6,000 five years ago. Most are from China or South Korea. These students plan to stay in the United States for college. School is easier here than back home.

Because foreign students are limited to one year of study at U.S. public schools, some then transfer to private schools. There is no time limit at private schools. And they are often charged more money than their American classmates.

Some experts say more rules are needed to manage the increase in foreign students. But some students are enjoying their time in the U.S.

## More Free Time Than At Home

At Murrieta Valley High School, Jixian "Johnny" Wang said he has more free time than he did in China. There, the school day lasted from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.

"School here is more independent. We can choose our classes," said Wang, 15, a 10th-grader who hopes to attend Georgetown University. "The teachers let students express their own opinions. The teachers are more like friends."

Qianhui "Lilith" Zhou is a 17-year-old in her last year of high school. She started studying for the SAT test to get into college as soon as she arrived in Murrieta. She misses her family and friends in Shanghai and hungers for real Chinese food. But those hardships are nothing compared to preparing for China's college entrance exam.

Schools are much more challenging in China, she said. "That's why I came to the U.S."
