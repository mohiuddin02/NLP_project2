MEXICO CITY â€” Mexico's president wants people to cut down on soft drinks. He wants to solve a health problem. So he is asking lawmakers to tax the sugary drinks.

Mexico has more overweight people than other nations of its size. A United Nations report says so. Overweight people risk getting diabetes and other diseases. Diabetes kills 70,000 in Mexico each year.

The soda tax is part of President Enrique Pena Nieto's larger tax plan. Nieto wants to raise money. Some of the money will go to helping poor people.

How will the tax affect Mexicans? They would pay an extra peso for each liter of sugary drinks they buy. A peso is about 8 cents. A liter is a little bigger than a quart. There would be no tax on drinks sold at movie theaters.

## Double The Soda Tax, Says One

Alejandro Calvillo works to protect consumer rights. Anyone who shops is a consumer. Calvillo applauds the idea of a soda tax.

"It's good that there would be a tax," Calvillo said. But he doesn't think the tax Nieto asked for will help. It's too small. The tax should be doubled to get people to drink less, he said.

Mexicans like soda. People in Mexico drink more Coca-Cola Co. beverages than people anywhere else.

Reporters contacted Coca-Cola de Mexico for comment. The company did not immediately respond.

Many countries are thinking about taxing soft drinks. France, Finland, Algeria and Hungary already do.

California is thinking about taxing soda. The tax would be a penny for each ounce. There are 12 ounces in a can of soda.

## A Tax Would Make People Drink Less

Michael Bloomberg is the mayor of New York. He pushed to improve public health. He tried to stop restaurants from selling soft drinks in cups larger than 16 ounces. But a New York court said he couldn't do that. Public health experts liked Bloomberg's campaign against sugary drinks. Critics made fun of it. They said it was part of a "nanny state."

One public health expert says a tax on sugar-sweetened drinks in the United States would make people drink them less. Studies show this, she said.

People would wind up drinking 10 to 12 percent less if prices rose 10 percent, said Yale University's Roberta R. Friedman.

Friedman said soft drinks have been linked to several diseases. Those include [obesity](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity), diabetes and heart disease.

Calvillo said the Mexican government should say more about how it would spend the money that would be raised by the soda tax. The amount is expected to be 2 billion pesos. That is about $152 million. He said some of the money should be spent to put drinking fountains back in schools and public places.

"High consumption of sugar drinks in the nation is highly linked to the lack of drinking water in public places," Calvillo said.
