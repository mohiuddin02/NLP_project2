MIAMI, Fla. â€” The Florida bonneted bat is a creature so mysterious that biologists know of only one roost of them in the wild. They are extremely chatty, making it far easier to hear than to see one, and we can thank citizen scientists for that information.

Over the past year, they have recorded the bats' songs and worked to paint a new picture of the rare bats, one of the state's most endangered species.

Luck also had a part, putting the bats close enough to a researcher having a glass of wine in her backyard.

"Who would have thought?" said volunteer Alfonso Perez, who is helping create a nonprofit group to raise money for more research. "If we just sit back and smell the roses, there's a lot of things going on."

## Biologist Organizes Effort To Record Bat Songs

All the attention has generated some star treatment for the bats: their own Facebook page, parties and a corporate sponsor. Much of that can be credited to biologist Kirsten Bohn, an expert in bat songs who discovered them in her neighborhood. She began organizing outings that were part party and part expedition to collect information about the bats, which have dropped to a few hundred in Florida.

Volunteers trained by Bohn found the first roost recorded in Southeast Florida, near the Gables Granada Golf Course. They used iPads and phones programmed to hear the bats' chirps and recorded more than 20,000 calls. These show that the pug-nosed bats feed and sing like no other bat in the United States.

On a recent night, wildlife veterinarian Frank Ridgely released the first bonneted bat raised at Zoo Miami. If all goes well, a tracker attached to the bat could let Ridgely observe its behavior in the wild.

## Research Could Influence U.S. Conservation Plans

All this new research could help federal officials now considering conservation plans for the bat. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service added the bat to the endangered species list in 2013, the first bat in 25 years. The agency is expected to propose a critical habitat, an area where the bats will live without being disturbed, by the end of the year.

The habitat could help avoid problems like the scene now playing out at the Granada golf course. The city of Coral Gables trimmed trees and removed grass there without contacting federal officials. State officials had signed off on the project, leading the city to believe the work would cause no harm.

But Bohn, who alerted federal agents, worries that bats with pups could roost in the trees. Stripping the grass could also affect the bugs they eat. The Fish and Wildlife Service, a government agency, is looking into the matter.

Ridgely said tougher steps must be taken to help the bats survive. Other parks in the county should be studied to replace the lost habitat, because the forest is never coming back in most of Miami-Dade County, he said.

## Deaths Of Bats Threaten Food Production

Conservation of bats has become more urgent in recent years, as a fungus called White Nose Syndrome and wind turbines have been killing them. Up to 2 million bats die each year, which threatens food production. Some bats pollinate plants and others, including the bonneted bat, eat large amounts of insects. Florida's bonneted bats face bigger risks from pesticides and habitat loss. Because they are large and fly high, they need plenty of room to maneuver. Their low numbers may show just how little open space remains in South Florida.

Bohn is an expert on bat calls and in 2014, she helped write the first study that used math to document bat singing.

Scientists in the study used the calls of several species, including bats. It turns out the clicks and chirps that bats make may sound like change jingling in your pocket, but are really more like a chorus of songbirds.

Bats, the study found, don't chirp just to get their bearings or find food; they also sing to flirt, fend off other males and call to their young. They sing from their nests and they sing when they fly. Like humans, they may have a language.

## Now Urban, Bats Forage Far For Food

Bohn set up recorders on the Granada golf course. Amazed at the number of calls, she began recording in other areas. The bats historically lived in pine rockland, where they can fly easily among sparse trees. Yet now most rockland is gone, so the bats adapted to become urban bats, living in whatever open space they could find, such as the parking lot around Zoo Miami.

Among Florida researchers, the Granada golf course was a well-known feeding ground. For Bohn, a move to the neighborhood in 2012 was lucky. Within weeks, Bohn heard the bat songs and began recording them. When neighbors read about the study, they contacted Bohn, who formed the Bat Squad to help collect information. At their first bat night at the golf course, Bacardi, whose logo includes a bat, provided free rum as hundreds of people wandered around the course or sat in lawn chairs gazing into the night sky.

In the past year, Bohn and volunteer grad students analyzed about 25,000 calls and logged the comings and goings of bats. The information helped paint a new picture of the urban bats. Bohn found that the bats call differently than other bat species plentiful in South Florida, which could make it easier to count the bats.

Bohn picked up bat calls all over southern Miami-Dade County, but in very low numbers. This suggests the bats travel far to find food. Bohn also found that the bats were sensitive to temperature, emerging from their roosts only on warm nights. Surveying during colder months could give inaccurate information, she said.

Without money to fund her study, Bohn was unable to complete more thorough research. She said she hoped volunteers in Florida would carry on, to provide more information so she could continue her research.
