BOSTON, Mass. â€” Moshe Kai Cavalin is only 17 years old. Yet he has already accomplished so much in his life. He has two college degrees, but he's too young to vote. He flies airplanes, but he's too young to drive a car alone.

Moshe lives in San Gabriel, California. He graduated from community college at age 11. Four years later, he had a college degree in math from the University of California, Los Angeles.

## A Teen Of Many Talents

This year, Moshe started taking online classes. He wanted to get a master's degree in a computer science field called cybersecurity. A master's degree is an advanced degree after college.

He had to put his goal on hold when he took a job with NASA, the United States space agency. Moshe helps NASA make technology for its airplanes.

He is busy with his job and college studies. Still, Moshe makes time for many hobbies. For example, he just published his second book. He wrote about being bullied by other kids. Moshe will get his pilot's license later this year. He is also very good at martial arts. He has won many trophies.

## Multicultural Family, Quick Study

Moshe says he is more ordinary than people think. His parents taught him well and let him choose his activities, he says. He has many different interests. Growing up, he was exposed to different cultures. His mother is from Taiwan, a country in Asia. His father is from Brazil, a country in South America.

People make a big deal about Moshe's accomplishments, but he does not feel all that special, he says. He does not like being called a genius. He likes to try new things. He tries to not compare himself with others. He just does the best he can.

His parents say Moshe was always a quick study. When he was 4 months old, he pointed to a jet in the sky. Then he said the Chinese word for airplane. That was his first word. Moshe was home schooled from a very young age. He studied a difficult math subject called trigonometry. Kids do not usually learn trigonometry until high school. Moshe was only 7 years old. Soon he ran out of challenging classwork. His mom started driving him to community college. He took classes there. His classmates were at least 10 years older.

## Farewell, Physics. Hello, Coding

Moshe's quick rise has had twists along the way. Early in college, he dreamed of being a scientist called an astrophysicist. Quickly he lost interest in studying the stars and planets. Instead, Moshe decided he wanted to write software for computers. This is called coding.

Becoming a coder has been a better fit. Moshe was surprised when NASA gave him a job. They had not hired him when he applied for a job before because he was too young. Now, however, Moshe was perfect for a project, according to his boss, Ricardo Arteaga. The project combines math, computers and airplane technology. Moshe is using his skills to stop airplanes from crashing into each other. He runs tests with computers to guide the airplanes to safety.

## He Can't Wait To Turn 18

Moshe plans to go back and finish his master's degree. Later, he wants to start his own computer company.

In many ways, Moshe is still a normal kid with normal goals. He is counting down the days until he turns 18. That is when he will be able to get his driver's license.
