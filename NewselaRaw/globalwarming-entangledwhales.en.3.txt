LONG BEACH, Calif. — The Pacific Ocean has been unusually warm this year. It could spell bad news for whales. Many swim through the waters off California when they migrate. Lately, they have been running into fishermen.

This year alone, more than 60 whales have become caught in fishing gear. That is a much higher amount than usual. Scientists believe the whales may be following prey closer to shore as warm water changes feeding patterns. This puts them closer to fishermen, crabbers and lobstermen.

## Whales Too Close To The Crabs

The situation is so serious that crab fishers have begun working closely with the government and environmental groups. Together they are trying to figure out where and how the whales are running into their gear. Experts are more worried about crab fishing than other types of fishing.

"This time of year, the whales would be offshore but with the blob of warm water, they're right off the beach. They're right where the crabs are," said Jim Anderson, a crabber.

Whales that have rope stuck in their mouths or wrapped tightly around their fins or tail cannot always free themselves. They will eventually die if not freed from the rope. Volunteer rescue teams are only able to free a few of them. The teams use tracking devices that allow them to follow the whales for miles. However, many swim away before being freed. No one knows what happens to them. 

## Whale Rescuers Answer Many More Calls

A humpback whale was partially freed recently in California. It had line stuck in its mouth. It also had a huge knot of rope 6 feet behind its tail and 200 more feet of rope and buoys dragging behind it. Another rescued nearby had a 70-foot line looped over its tail. The line was connected to a lobster pot still swinging from the rope's end underwater.

Keith Yip joined in both rescues. He volunteers as the leader of a rescue team. He has been called out four times in the past six weeks. Yip has done 10 rescues in the past two years. He has had about 50 in total in the past 30 years.

"It's another job in and of itself recently," Yip said. His regular job is working with animals at SeaWorld. Now he has been spending his weekends rescuing whales.

## Trying To Avoid Whales

Dungeness crab fishing can bring in up to $100 million a season. Rather than crack down on it, the government decided to tap into the crabbers' knowledge. It wants to figure out where whales and fishermen are running into each other. The crab season is delayed this year because ocean plants in the Pacific have been making the crabs sick. However, crabbers plan to help when the season continues later this winter or next year.

Nearly 100 crabbers had a training this fall near San Francisco. They learned how to take pictures of caught whales, call them in to a hotline and then "babysit" them until experts arrive. A guide for handling whales has been given to all crabbers.

When crabbing does continue, fishermen will work alongside scientists on their boats. They will test different strengths of rope and gear.

## Whale Watchers Are Watching

"We've got pots in the water, we've got ropes in the water and we've got whales in the water," Anderson said. "What can we do to make this a safe place for everybody?"

Environmental groups are going to help, too.

It is a promising start but might not be enough, said David Anderson. He runs whale watching tours in California.

Anderson was one of the first to realize there was a serious problem under the water. His tours kept running into distressed whales.

He said the caught whales are just a small part of the problem. "Most of the whales we're not seeing — and it's a huge problem."
