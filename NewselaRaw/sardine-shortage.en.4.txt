LOS ANGELES â€” A fishing boat motored slowly through the water off California's coast. Its tired captain had been fishing all night. But after 12 hours at sea, Corbin Hanson and his boat mates returned to shore. They hadn't caught a single sardine, a small silvery fish.

There are fewer sardines around than there have been in years. The drop has caused rules that limit the number of sardines fishermen are allowed to catch. Scientists say it is affecting the ecosystem. Brown pelicans and sea lions that eat the oily fish could be starving.

If things don't get better soon, there could be serious problems for the West Coast's ocean animals, seabirds and fishermen.

The number of sardines is dropping faster than it has in years. And scientists say there will be fewer and fewer sardines in the future. It is unclear why.

## Important Link In Food Chain

One possible reason is a weather pattern. The weather brings cold water with lots of nutrition in it to the West Coast. The pattern has helped some kinds of fish, but it has hurt sardines.

Fishermen are not allowed to catch as many sardines. Some environmental groups say they shouldn't fish for sardines at all.

In the 1940s, sardines were being fished all of the time. The huge numbers of fish made the city of Monterey, Calif., into one of the world's top places for fishermen.

By the 1960s, sardines had practically vanished. California stopped letting people catch sardines for 18 years. The number of sardines rebounded in the 1980s and fishing resumed. But it was never like the way it was before.

Since the 1940s, scientists have debated why there are fewer sardines. How much of it was because of the ocean? And how was it much from overfishing?

In the last few years, scientists have learned more about why sardines are important in the food chain. They are small and packed with nutrition. They eat tiny animals called plankton. And then they are preyed on by big fish, seabirds, seals and whales.

Some predators like sea lions may be starving without the sardines. Scientists saw a big problem in 2013. Hundreds of malnourished sea lion pups washed up along the beaches.

Nursing sea lion mothers could not find fatty sardines, said scientist Sharon Melin. They fed on squid and fish that had less nutrition. Because they didn't have enough nutrition, mothers produced less milk for their young. Their babies were underweight.

## No Luck Tonight

Biologists think the drop is hurting brown pelicans too. The seabirds eat sardines and have also shown signs of starving.

Hanson is an example of how fishermen have been affected. Just a few years ago, Hanson pulled in nets full of sardines.

Not anymore. If he catches sardines now, they are larger, older fish. They are mostly shipped to other countries. There, they are ground up for pet or fish food. It's hard to find the small young fish. The young fish can be sold for bait or canned and eaten.

He was trying to be hopeful when he embarked for Catalina Island one evening. "We're going to get a lot of fish tonight," he said.

They sailed around the island for hours. Then, they heard another boat captain's voice on the radio saying he hadn't seen any fish.

The boats turned around. They were hoping to net sardines in their usual hideouts. No such luck.

So instead, Hanson piloted the big boat back to shore, empty.
