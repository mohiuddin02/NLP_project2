The United Nations on Wednesday unveiled a memorial to the millions of African men, women and children who were forced into slavery.

The Ark of Return commemorates the 15 million Africans who died during the trans-Atlantic slave trade. The memorial also remembers the millions of others forcibly taken from their families to work as slaves on plantations in the Americas.

"It encourages us to consider the historical legacy of slavery and above all, it ensures that we never forget," U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said during the ceremony.

## Memorial A Reminder Of A Brutal Institution

The memorial was designed by Haitian-American architect Rodney Leon. He competed against 310 architects and designers for the chance to design the structure. It is located on the visitors' plaza at the United Nation's New York headquarters.

Leon said the triangle-shaped marble statue was inspired by the theme, "acknowledge the tragedy, consider the tragedy, lest we forget." He and his team drew inspiration from maps of the triangular slave trade, the largest forced migration in history. Maps of the slave trade are carved into the monument. Leon was also inspired by the ships that transported Africans to Europe and the Americas. He imagined the experiences of people gong through the "door of no return" at a castle on Goree Island in Senegal. Many slaves were kept there before they were shipped to the Americas.

Ban said the memorial stands as a reminder of the slaves' brutal crossing of the Atlantic Ocean. It also recognizes "the significant contributions that slaves and their descendants have made."

He said that the "powerful memorial" helps the world acknowledge the terrible tragedy that befell millions of people.

## "A Stain On Human History"

The United Nations has declared 2015 to 2024 as the International Decade for People of African Descent. Ban called slavery "a stain on human history." He said the monument will give people the opportunity to consider the causes and consequences of racism so they might wipe out prejudice and intolerance.

Ban also said he hopes The Ark of Return will become a call to action against modern-day slavery.

The memorial project began more than five years ago and was led by African and Caribbean nations. The Permanent Representative of Jamaica to the United Nations, Courtenay Rattray, served as chair of the Permanent Memorial Committee. Several nations, along with UNESCO, helped raise more than $1.7 million to build the memorial.

Jamaica is a member of the 15-member Caribbean Community. The group of Caribbean nations wants reparations from European nations that carried out the slave trade. Reparations are payments that would compensate them for slavery. After the slaves were freed, they never received any money.

## Freedom Earned By Forebears

Jamaica Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller noted that Britain outlawed the slave trade on March 25, 1807. Yet, slavery did not end, she said. In the United States, slavery was not completely abolished until the Civil War ended in 1865.

"For us, freedom came after a long journey,"  she said. "Freedom was not gifted to us but rather earned by the sweat,  blood, and tears of millions of our forebears," who were slaves.

The New World was built on the backs of slaves, she said.

Professor Jean Crusol of Martinique said the memorial also stands as a tribute to the many freedom fighters who struggled to end slavery. Among them were Louis Delgres and a woman named Solitude, who fought against slavery in the French Caribbean. He also singled out Queen Nanny in Jamaica and Toussaint L'Ouverture of Haiti, who led a slave uprising. Haiti became the first nation to end slavery, in 1804.

In 2001, France declared slavery a crime against humanity. Crusol said it was time for the entire world to recognize slavery as a crime against humanity. "This is our challenge," he said. "This should be the test, the collective goals of the near future for this family of nations."
