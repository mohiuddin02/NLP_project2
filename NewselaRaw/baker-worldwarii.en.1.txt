INCLINE VILLAGE, Nev. — Ernie Feld, owner and operator of a tiny pastry shop near Lake Tahoe, Nevada, has been using the same recipes for decades. One treat, his popular poppy-seed strudel, once helped save his life.

Feld used to make poppy-seed strudels for the Nazi SS officers who held him captive during the final years of World War II. The SS was a Nazi military unit that was responsible for some of the worst crimes committed by the Germans during the war. As the officers' baker, Feld was able to survive the mass killings that took the lives of millions of other European Jews.

At 90, he still runs Ernie's International Pastries, artfully preparing the treats he has made for seven decades. His signature treats include strudels, Austrian Sacher torte and lemon Napoleons.

## A Skill For Life

Feld has a sweet, grandfatherly sense of humor, but what he experienced as a young man was horrific. While Feld was being held prisoner at a makeshift German-run airport in Budapest, three dozen of his family members — including his beloved mother, Sara — were killed by the Nazis in death camps.

Feld's fate was different. "The German SS needed me because I could cook," he explained. "Baking saved my life. If I wasn't a baker, I'd probably be dead."

He was born in Czechoslovakia in 1925 and grew up as Europe was on the brink of all-out war for the second time in 30 years. His father died in an accident, and his mother supported their family by running a restaurant. Feld, who everyone called Ernie, grew up watching her bake, and soon he followed in her footsteps. "When I was 14, I was always licking this and licking that," he remembered. "Mother would say, 'Are you eating again? I'm going to send you to baker's school.'"

For three years, he worked as an assistant baker while attending cooking classes at night. When war broke out, food prices soared. His bosses started sending Feld on bicycle trips into the countryside to look for eggs and flour, which had become hard to find.

In 1942, three years after the Nazis invaded Czechoslovakia, Nazi soldiers began rounding up the Jews and sending them to concentration camps, where millions were murdered or forced into hard labor. Feld was just 17. All his mother could do was watch as soldiers made him board a train taking him away from his home. He never saw her again.

Feld was taken to Hungary, where he first worked as a cook at a farm camp. Then a Nazi SS leader, in need of a good chef for an officer's club at an airport that the Germans were building near Budapest, heard about the Jewish baker-turned-prisoner. "He asked me, 'What can you cook?'" Feld remembered.

Feld was chosen for the job, so the Nazis sent him into Budapest to shop for the ingredients he would need. He had to wear a yellow armband signifying he was a Jew and he was followed by a guard to prevent his escape.

## Surviving The Camp

Over the following months, he made his poppy-seed strudels, as well as pasta with poppy seeds, pastries with frankfurters, and cannoli, which Nazi officers said he cooked like an Italian.

Feld's cooking made him popular enough with the Nazis that they kept him in the kitchen rather than sending him outside to perform hard labor. Feld enlisted other Jewish prisoners as kitchen helpers to spare them from hard labor as well. He recalls how they stood around a huge table, rolling out their dough, feeling lucky to be alive.

By 1945, with the Allies pressing in and the Germans on the run, Feld was able to escape and was eventually saved by advancing Russian troops. Back home, fellow survivors told him that his mother and younger brother, Alex, had been killed, along with many of his cousins, aunts and uncles.

## Time For A New Name

Feld eventually made his way to the San Francisco Bay Area, and he continued baking. Customers used to regularly ask about his original last name, Ehrenfeld, and these conversations started getting in his way.

"By the time I finished telling people about my name, my pastries got burned," Feld joked, so he decided to change his name. "I told the judge I wanted to cut it in half," he said. Ernie Ehrenfeld became Ernie Feld.

That name signifies a past that took all of Feld's bravery to survive.

Now, at age 90, Feld sits at a table near the glass display case as his wife, Marika, does the baking, following recipes he taught her over their 22-year marriage. Since breaking his leg in a fall five months ago, he often uses a walker and wheelchair. "I used to give her instructions," he said. "Now she orders me around."

As Feld opened a box of photographs, faded images of his past, Marika whispered something to him in Hungarian. "She wants me to say that those Nazis are probably dead, but Ernie is still making his poppy-seed strudels," Feld translated, smiling.
