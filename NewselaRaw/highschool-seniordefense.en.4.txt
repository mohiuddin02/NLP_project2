LOS ANGELES, Calif. â€” It was a big day for Jorge Magana. The 18-year-old got all dressed up. He had to give his senior presentation at Los Angeles High School of the Arts.

Magana had 45 minutes to talk to three tough judges. One of the judges was his assistant principal. The other two were also important people from his school.

It was almost the end of the school year. Magana wanted the judges to say he was finished with high school. He wanted to graduate. Magana showed them his portfolio and explained everything in it.

## Portfolios Are Like Photo Albums Of Schoolwork

The portfolio was full of Magana's best schoolwork. It was like showing the judges a photo album from the classes he took. All of his most important projects were in the portfolio. Magana took his time explaining each one.

Then it was the judges' turn to ask their questions: Where did you find your facts? What was the hardest part? How will you use these skills in the future?

Most high schools do not make seniors do presentations like Magana's. They use report cards to decide whether students get to graduate. Test scores can also make a difference.

## A New Way To Judge If Students Are Ready

Presentations are a new way to see which students are ready to leave high school. They take a long time and cost more money than tests. Still, the presentations are becoming more popular.

Soon, every high school senior in Los Angeles will have to present a portfolio. Students will not be able to graduate without one. They will have to do a good job explaining their work.

Ten high schools are already testing the portfolio program. More schools will start using the program next year.

## Pushing Students To Show What They Know

Isabel Morales teaches at Magana's school. She says portfolio presentations are a good challenge. They push students to explain what they have learned.

It was tricky for Magana. He had a hard time explaining his work. The judges did not get to hear how much Magana really knew about his projects. He did not get a passing grade on his presentation.

Morales says she has learned a lot from watching students like Magana have a hard time. She has changed the way she teaches.

Now Morales makes time in class so students can share their work. She wants them to get used to talking about what they have learned.

Magana got another shot at giving his presentation. He showed the judges his portfolio again a week later and passed. Now he will get to graduate.
