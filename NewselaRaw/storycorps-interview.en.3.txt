StoryCorps is a group that makes sure people's life stories are not lost. The group has a challenge for students across America.

StoryCorps wants teenagers to interview their grandparents. Teens will ask questions just like a news reporter would. They will also need to record their conversations.

StoryCorps calls this project "The Great Thanksgiving Listen." The group says Thanksgiving is the perfect time for a good talk. If a grandparent is not available, teens can talk to another family member.

Students will use smartphones to record their interviews. StoryCorps has a new app to make that easy. The app will send the recordings to the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.

The recordings will become part of the American Folklife Center. Anyone will be able to listen to them.

## Stories Bring People Closer

StoryCorps has asked history teachers for help with the Thanksgiving challenge. Some teachers will make the project a real homework assignment. Others will just help spread the word about the challenge.

Dave Isay is the founder of StoryCorps. He says "The Great Thanksgiving Listen" is an assignment that will last for many years.

Teens will be giving their "great-great-great-great-great-grandkids" a gift, Isay says. Listeners will have a chance to understand more about who their ancestors were.

Isay hopes these interviews will become a normal part of every Thanksgiving holiday. He wants us to learn from the wisdom of older people.

The interviews and stories can help to bring families closer together. He says StoryCorps helps people feel more connected. It also gives the person who is being interviewed the chance to be heard.

## Good Interviewing, Listening Skills

Brandon Clarke helps run the Berkeley Carroll School. The school worked with StoryCorps to make materials for teachers who will do the challenge with their classes.

Students at Clark's school are learning about interviewing skills. They are coming up with good questions to ask.

Isay says interviewing is not hard. He thinks people are naturally good at it. They just have to pay attention. Picking a quiet place to talk also helps.

Isay says people seem to understand that the interviews are important. "They treat it very seriously," he said.

## Many Ways To Hear The Stories

StoryCorps has collected 60,000 interviews since 2003. About 10,000 of those were recorded using the new StoryCorps app. The app just came out in March 2015.

The other 50,000 interviews took place in StoryCorps' own recording booths. There are booths set up in four big cities. StoryCorps also has a booth on wheels that travels all over the country.

Going to the library is just one way to hear StoryCorps interviews.

Some people listen to the StoryCorps interviews on the radio. A popular radio show called "Morning Edition" plays them every Friday. The show has about 13 million listeners.

StoryCorps also uses the recordings to make videos. They use cartoons to act out what people are saying.
