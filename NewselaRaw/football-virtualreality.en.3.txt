STANFORD, Calif. â€” Trent Edwards was a quarterback in college. Now he is back playing football again. At least it seems that way. Edwards is actually standing on a stage at Stanford University. He is showing the future of football to a crowded class.

Edwards is wearing a virtual-reality headset. Everything he sees through his goggles is shown on a big screen. Virtual reality is a technology that lets users enter new worlds. The worlds are created by computers.

Putting on a headset lets someone step into these computer-created places.

## In The Middle Of The Game, But Not Really

Edwards turns to his right and his left. Waves of "whoa" and "no way!" spread through the crowd. Surprisingly, it looks and sounds as if Edwards is in the middle of a football game.

Something shakes in Edwards' voice. In his mind, he is a college quarterback again.

"I'm feeling it right now," he says.

Edwards gets so into it that he forgets where he is. He takes a step forward and nearly falls off the stage.

Virtual-reality technology could begin changing football this fall. Several college and NFL teams have signed up to use it. The San Francisco 49ers and Dallas Cowboys are two of them.

Players, especially quarterbacks, can practice plays they usually see only during a game. Using 3-D technology is also a way to allow backup players a chance to get experience without playing in a game. It can reduce hard-hitting contact between players. Many players have gotten head injuries over the years.

## A Great Idea For A Company

Stanford football coach David Shaw said he has been turning down technology like this for 20 years. Older versions were "terrible, terrible," he said. They all looked like video games.

The idea to use virtual reality for football began at Stanford. In 2005, football player Derek Belch took a class there. It was taught by professor Jeremy Bailenson, the world's expert on virtual reality. His class explained how our brain works in a virtual- reality situation. After class, Belch said to him: "Wouldn't it be great if we could use this to train football players?"

Bailenson thought it was an excellent idea. Then Jeremy Bailenson, Edwards and Belch brought Shaw the 3-D technology. Shaw was so impressed, he even gave some money to help start a company. They named it STRIVR Labs. The ST is for Stanford, and the VR stands for virtual reality.

## Thumbs-Up From The Quarterback

Kevin Hogan is the quarterback for the Stanford Cardinal team. He used the STRIVR technology before his last three games.

"His decision-making was faster. Everything was quicker," coach Shaw said.

STRIVR can also add noise, light or other conditions a team might have to deal with on game days.

"We can make it dark. We can make it rain. If it exists, we can create it," said Tracy Hughes. He advises STRIVR on ways to help the business to grow. "We can pump in crowd noise."

## Big Leagues Get It First

For now, virtual-reality equipment is expensive. Only the NFL or major college teams can afford it. High schools and youth league teams will have to wait until a cheaper version comes out.

Shaw thinks it will soon be used by every top football program.

"In this world, I get to see what my quarterback sees," he said. "I get to see which way he's looking. And I don't have to guess. I actually see which way he turns and can see exactly in his field of view.

"That's huge for us," he said. "And that's going to be huge for our team."
