ATLANTA — This summer, many were shocked by the images coming out of Ferguson, Missouri. Police confronting protesters angry about the shooting death of Michael Brown were in full riot gear, with some driving tank-like armored vehicles. Demonstrators were dispersed with stinging, choking tear gas.

Scenes such as those have brought increased scrutiny of a controversial federal program. Since the 1990s that program, known as the 1033 program, has transferred surplus military supplies to local police, including those serving schools.

Georgia colleges and school systems are among those that have taken advantage of the program. Some have obtained assault-style rifles better known for their use in combat, spurring calls for limits on the program.

University and school officials have said they need the weapons to protect their students. Many mention past shootings at places such as Virginia Tech and Newtown, Connecticut, as the reason they feel compelled to obtain more weaponry. Critics of the program feel it may lead to an overuse of force and a militarization of campus police.

## Humvees And M-16s

The 1033 program was named for a part of the National Defense Authorization Act, a law governing the budget of the Department of Defense. It extends to local agencies, including school systems and public state colleges and universities.

In Georgia, a handful of school law enforcement agencies — in three public school districts and at six colleges or universities — have participated in the program.

Fulton County Schools, for example, received two all-terrain military vehicles, known as Humvees, which district officials say have been helpful during bad weather. Other school systems, including the Bibb County School District, have gotten a collection of combat rifles, such as M-16s and M-14s.

Last week, leaders from about a dozen national civic and education organizations signed a letter asking the Defense Logistics Agency to stop arming school police with military weapons. Also last week, Democratic Representative Hank Johnson filed the Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement Act, which Congress will put to a vote.

The Act would limit the program by preventing local agencies from receiving certain kinds of weapons, including tanks, flash-bang grenades, rocket launchers and all guns greater than .50-caliber.

"It's so unfortunate that our society has come to this, that we feel that more militarizing will actually solve a problem. It has yet to do that," said Marlyn Tillman, a co-founder of the group Gwinnett SToPP, which opposes stationing police in schools. The group's full name is Gwinnett Parent Coalition to Dismantle the School to Prison Pipeline.

"We're turning to a solution that really is the problem," she said.

## Mass Shooting A Turning Point

However, public safety officials in Georgia and across the country say the weapons are needed to protect school campuses and students in case of emergencies, such as the massacre at Virginia Tech in 2007. Thirty-two people were killed by a student during that incident.

Officials called the mass shooting a turning point for school safety.

"That caused our police department — as well as just about every other police agency around the country — to re-evaluate its training" and "preparedness," said John Lester, a spokesman for Columbus State University (CSU). The university's police received three M-16s, records show. The weapons were part of Columbus State's "active shooter" preparedness efforts, Lester said.

"Fortunately," he said, "we have never had to use them."

The benefit of the program is that it allows campus departments to have weapons that have already been widely used by law enforcement agencies, Kennesaw State University (KSU) Police Chief Roger Stearns said. For years, the "bad guys" had been better armed than police, he said.

KSU received four M-16s and two M-14s through the program. The six rifles are assigned to officers who have completed 30-plus hours in rifle training.

"We have more than 25,000 students, then add faculty and staff … a university is a small city," Stearns said. "We have a responsibility to provide the same level of protection as that provided by any other city."
