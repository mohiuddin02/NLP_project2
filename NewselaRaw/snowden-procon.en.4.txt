### PRO: Leaked information on NSA wrongdoing

WASHINGTON — Edward Snowden is a brave American hero.

> The National Security Agency has been collecting information about nearly every phone call in America. It also has gathered information about emails. This was a huge violation of Americans' private lives. Snowden was the first person to let people know about it.

He will be remembered as a hero long after the "war on terror" is over. By then our government will have some new excuse for violating Americans' rights and the rights of the rest of the world.

Our government has tried to capture him. But, he won his first big court victory on Dec. 16. A judge ruled that the NSA's collecting of Americans' phone records was probably against the Constitution.

## Spying For Companies

Our newspapers and TV news stations have let us down. They have reported that our government's spying is an effort to protect Americans from terrorism.

But our government's actions obviously had nothing to do with terrorism.

Our government has spied on other countries. It did not do this to catch terrorists. It spied to help give the U.S. companies an advantage.

The NSA also spied on the phones of leaders from other countries, including Germany and Brazil.

Don't get me wrong: that's bad enough. Most people don't want to share the details of their private lives with government spies. But the Obama government has managed to convince some people that the NSA is just storing our private information and not using it.

We're led to believe that our private information is simply sorted by computers. It's just being used to find terrorists, we are told.

However, there is a mountain of evidence that says the opposite. This widespread gathering of our private information is in fact being used against everyday citizens. All these Americans have done is join groups whose actions are protected by our Constitution. Our government has already spied on anti-war groups. Public educators have been targeted.

## "Our Crooked Spy State"

Our government has the ability to use the NSA's information for the wrong purposes. It can mess with groups that don't agree with our government.

In 2011, the Boston police, Boston Regional Intelligence Center and the FBI were busy tracking people. But they were just members of protest groups, not terrorists.

As a result, they seem to have ignored important intelligence. Information was literally handed to them about the terrorists who bombed the Boston Marathon. This tells you a lot about what's important to our crooked spy state.

In the 1960s, Martin Luther King Jr. was inspiring millions in his fight for the rights of African-Americans and poor people.

Today, it would have information on his every move and phone call. It would know about every activist in the civil rights struggle across the country. That is the difference that technology makes and it's important that we don't let our government get away with it.

Our spy state is also making the U.S. into a country run by companies and the military. They're becoming more powerful compared to our elected leaders, including the president.

And our military and spies are using their power in other ways. They're currently blocking attempts to cut down the NSA's bad actions.

It's not just your private life that is being invaded. Our entire democracy is being attacked.

### CON: Gave away secrets of free and open nations

Edward Snowden did work for the U.S. government. His work let him know secrets about how the U.S. spied on people's phone records and email information. Snowden gave that information to the world.

He might not meet the definition of the word "traitor" according to U.S. law. But he certainly is one in the way most people think of the word.

He made national security secrets public. He claims to have done this for a good reason. He wants to use the power of the Internet to make people aware of the wrongdoings of evil governments. But in fact, he has told us almost nothing about countries like North Korea, Iran, China, Cuba and Venezuela.

Instead, he's mostly spilled secrets from nations considered to be the most free and open. These are democratic countries that hold elections. They're countries that put together peacekeeping and humanitarian missions to help people in need around the world. These countries work to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. They fight terrorism. They're the ones supporting human rights.

## Hurt Supporters Of Freedom

For whatever reason he did it, Snowden's actions have hurt the countries that are the greatest supporters of freedom. And he's helped the world's most undemocratic countries.

Snowden was doing the same thing as Julian Assange. Assange started WikiLeaks. That website also discloses government secrets.

Snowden has betrayed the idea of freedom. The Snowden/Assange view of the world says that governments must be completely open about what they do. They think that equals freedom. This is not just being overly innocent — it's worse.

Respect for our private lives is an essential part of freedom. The government of free peoples is part of the people. We elect it. The government rules for us. Free societies recognize that keeping some secrets is a necessary job of government.

Democracies operate under the idea of "ordered liberty." They establish rules to protect both the individual and the country as a whole. Democracies guard both individual freedom and the safety of its people. No one has the right to throw away those rules and make up their own. Disregarding ordered liberty doesn't advance freedom. It just creates chaos. And chaos enables evil and kills democracies like our own.

Snowden is not a "freedom fighter." And he's not a "whistle-blower" who is exposing bad activities by our government. His leaks are broad and all over the place. Most of them show no wrongdoing whatsoever.

## Was Supposed To Safeguard Secrets

What about those cases where Snowden might argue he has revealed government actions that might cross the line? His actions are still, at best, irresponsible.

The United States system of ordered liberty offers several ways to raise claims of wrongdoing by our government. Those ways don't put our country in danger. Government agencies have inspectors. Congress routinely investigates claims of government wrongdoing.

And, yes, we have "whistle-blower" protection laws. These protect people from being attacked by a government whose bad actions they need to expose. But, the notion that Snowden had no choice but to leak secrets is indefensible.

Finally, Snowden betrayed the trust he was given by the U.S. government. He was supposed to safeguard the nation's secrets.

Free societies depend on trustworthy citizens. Bank tellers, lawyers, doctors, police officials and others are all in positions of trust. These people can't decide that they get to choose what information should or should not be dumped out for everyone to see.

If they did, we wouldn't be living in an open society. We would be living in North Korea, where no one is trusted … ever.

Edward Snowden has betrayed freedom. In the end, that's a much greater offense than intentionally acting like an enemy and traitor to his country.
