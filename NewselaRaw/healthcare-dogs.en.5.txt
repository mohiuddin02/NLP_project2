DALLAS â€” Brian Boone is a soldier. He got hurt in a war. Boone lost part of his leg. He also could not use his arm for a year. His arm is stronger now, but he still needs help.

Brindle is his new service dog. Service dogs learn to help people who are sick or hurt. They guide blind people who cannot see. They protect their owners from falls. They can even pull wheelchairs.

Brindle will help Boone pick things up from the ground.

"Good boy," Boone said to his dog.

## Try To Sound Nicer

A dog trainer helps Boone work with Brindle. Her name is Sarah Koch. She tells Boone to sound even nicer to the dog. Boone should talk in a higher voice.

Boone tried again. "Goooooood booooooooy," Boone said. The dog looked up sweetly. He seemed very proud of himself.

They have become partners.

A service dog group and a hospital company brought man and dog together.

## Canine Companions

The name of the service dog group is Canine Companions for Independence. It teaches the dogs how to help. Each dog costs $50,000 to train. The hospital company is called Baylor Scott and White Health. It finds people who need service dogs. It also pays for the training.

## A Lot Of Training

Service dogs go through a lot of training. The training program is hard. The dogs learn more than 40 commands. They learn to sit. They learn to obey. They even learn to pick up keys up from the floor. Only two out of five dogs finish the training program. The dogs who finish are the best.

Boone is excited about his new dog. Just being around the dog makes him happy. "That is hard to beat," Boone said.
