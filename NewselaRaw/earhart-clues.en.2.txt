MIAMI — The photo is unremarkable. It shows an airplane sitting on a runway at Miami Municipal Airport in the shadows just before dawn.

The picture was taken on June 1, 1937, of aviator Amelia Earhart's plane, moments before she took off on her doomed flight around the world.

The picture, though, contains an odd detail — a shiny silver patch on the body of the plane. The patch doesn't show up on any of the other thousands of photos of her plane.

Could it be a clue — the clue — to what happened when Earhart vanished over the Pacific Ocean three months later?

## Linking Photo To Metal

Longtime Earhart investigator Ric Gillespie thinks so. He believes that the silvery patch is evidence of a repair. He hopes that computer imaging will link it to a metal scrap that may have broken off Earhart's plane. The wreckage was found 25 years ago on a tiny Pacific island in the area where Earhart and her navigator Fred Noonan disappeared.

Gillespie hopes to match a pattern of rivet holes from the patch in the photo to the rivets on the wreckage. "It would be beyond dispute that Noonan and Earhart weren't lost at sea, but made it to the island." Gillespie is the executive director of the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR). The organization investigates missing plane cases and recovers old aircraft.

If Gillespie is right, it would solve one of the greatest mysteries in aviation history. It would also mean, possibly, that Earhart died — not when her plane crashed into the sea — but on a deserted island.

## Troubles Early On

Earhart was one of the world's most famous and admired women when she and Noonan tried to become the first to fly around the world. She was the first woman to fly across the Atlantic Ocean and she was a feminist before the word was invented. Earhart wanted women to be allowed to become anything they wanted.

The trip didn't go well from the start. First, she landed at the wrong airport in Miami. The landing was rough and the plane needed repairs.

One of them involved the removal of a window in the rear of the airplane. The window is clearly visible in photos of Earhart's plane taken in California at the start of her trip.

But in the photo shot on June 1, 1937, the window is gone. It is replaced by that odd silvery plate.

"I think the window must have been broken or (weakened) by the hard landing in Miami," Gillespie said. "So they just took it out and patched the (plane) instead."

After a month of flight, a radio antenna on the bottom of her plane tore away. That might have been why she couldn't hear Coast Guard crewmen trying to radio her as she neared Howland Island 19 hours later. "We are circling but cannot see island, cannot hear you," she radioed. Messages continued for more than an hour and then Earhart gave her location: "We are on the line of position 157 dash 337. … We are now running north and south."

The rest was silence.

## Clues Found, And Then Lost

Rescue ships began looking for Earhart right away. Eventually search planes passed over Gardner Island, about 400 miles away from Howland. They spotted signs of recent habitation. But tribes of Pacific Islanders had been believed to be living there, and so the planes moved on.

Later, British records showed a human skeleton and a woman's shoe had been found on Gardner Island. The bones have since disappeared.

In 1991, during an expedition to Gardner, TIGHAR investigators found a scrap of aluminum with rows of rivet holes. The scrap looked like it came from the torn outer skin of an airplane.

Tests showed the scrap's material was used in all American planes made in the 1930s. It was also used in Earhart's Lockheed Electra, but the rivet patterns did not come from an Electra.

TIGHAR began looking at photos of Earhart's plane to see if the scrap could have come from the patch. Only one shot offered a good view of the patch — the 1937 photo.

"If we can match that rivet pattern in the photo," Gillespie said, "I don't see how anybody can argue against this anymore."

Gillespie thinks Earhart landed her plane on a coral reef just off Gardner Island. She then used the plane's radio to call for help.

## Distress Calls Not Taken Seriously

After she disappeared, more than 100 shortwave radio listeners heard distress calls from a woman identifying herself as Earhart. The calls were considered fakes. But Gillespie believes some of them may have been genuine.

One of the reports came from a Florida teenager named Betty Klenck. She died recently at the age of 92.

Three days after the plane went down, Betty heard a call on her radio from someone who identified herself as Earhart. For three hours, the teenager listened, jotting down notes. The woman pleaded for help, comforted an apparently injured Fred Noonan, and cried. "Oh, if they could hear me."

Officials thought it came from the imagination of a bored teenager and weren't interested. Yet the notebook contains information Betty couldn't possibly have known. Gillespie believes the woman may really have been Earhart, calling from Gardner Island.
