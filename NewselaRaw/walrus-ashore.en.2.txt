ANCHORAGE, Alaska â€” Pacific walrus can't find sea ice for resting in Arctic waters. As a result, they are coming ashore in record numbers on a beach in northwest Alaska.

About 35,000 walrus were photographed Saturday about 5 miles north of Point Lay.

Point Lay is an Inupiat Eskimo village. It lies 300 miles southwest of Barrow, the northernmost city in the United States, and 700 miles northwest of Anchorage, Alaska's largest city.

The enormous gathering was spotted by a researchers during an annual survey of Arctic marine animals.

## Using Sea Ice To Rest

Walrus were first spotted on Sept. 13, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. They have been moving on and off shore. Observers last week saw the remains of about 50 dead walrus on the beach. The animals may have been killed in a stampede. Officials were putting together a team of scientists to figure out how they died.

Pacific walrus spend winters in the Bering Sea. Females give birth on sea ice. They also use ice as a diving platform to reach snails, clams and worms on the shallow continental shelf.

Unlike seals, walrus cannot keep swimming. They must rest. Walrus use their tusks to "haul out," or pull themselves onto ice or rocks.

As temperatures warm in summer, the edge of the sea ice gets pushed further north. Females and their young ride the edge of the sea ice into the Chukchi Sea, the body of water north of the Bering Strait.

In recent years, sea ice has receded north beyond shallow continental shelf waters and into Arctic Ocean water. There, depths are bigger than 2 miles and walrus cannot dive to the bottom.

## "Environmental Conditions Changing"

Walrus in large numbers were first spotted on the U.S. side of the Chukchi Sea in 2007. They returned in 2009. In 2011, scientists estimated there were 30,000 walrus along 1 kilometer of beach near Point Lay. A kilometer equals 0.62 mile.

Young animals are at greater risk of being hurt in stampedes when a group gathers nearly shoulder-to-shoulder on a beach. Stampedes can be triggered by a polar bear, human hunter or low-flying airplane. More than 130 mostly young walrus died during a stampede in September 2009 at Alaska's Icy Cape.

The World Wildlife Fund said walrus have also been gathering in large groups on the Russian side of the Chukchi Sea.

"It's another remarkable sign of the dramatic environmental conditions changing as the result of sea ice loss," said Margaret Williams, who runs the World Wildlife Fund's Arctic program.

"The walrus are telling us  that the Arctic environment is changing extremely rapidly and it is time for the rest of the world to take notice, and also to take action to address the root causes of climate change," she said.

This summer, the sea ice's annual low point was the sixth smallest since satellite monitoring began in 1979.
