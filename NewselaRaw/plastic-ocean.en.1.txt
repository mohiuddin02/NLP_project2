Carefully, she guided its descent through swaying kelp and schools of fish. Her plan was to catch pieces of a mysterious marine ecosystem scientists are calling the plastisphere.

It starts with particles of degraded plastic no bigger than grains of salt. Bacteria take up residence on those tiny pieces of trash. Then single-celled animals feed on the bacteria, and larger predators feed on them.

"We've created a new man-made ecosystem of plastic debris," said Lopez, who is studying at the University of San Diego.

The plastisphere was six decades in the making. It's a product of the discarded plastic — flip-flops, margarine tubs, toys, toothbrushes — that gets swept from city sewer systems and river channels into the sea.

## Hitchhikers On Plastic Bits

When that debris washes into the ocean, it breaks down into bits. These bits are then colonized by microscopic organisms that scientists are just beginning to understand. Researchers suspect that some of these tiny creatures may be pathogens – that is, disease-causing bacteria – hitching long-distance rides on floating junk.

Scientists also fear that creatures in the plastisphere are completely breaking down chunks of polyethylene and polypropylene, allowing dangerous chemicals to seep into the environment.

"This is an issue of great concern," said marine geochemist Tracy Mincer. "Microbes may be greatly accelerating the weathering of plastic debris into finer bits. If so, we aren't sure how zooplankton and other small creatures are responding to that." And, she said, we don't know "whether harmful additives, pigments, plasticizers, flame retardants and other toxic compounds are leaching into the water."

About 245 million tons of plastic is produced annually around the world. That represents 70 pounds of plastic annually for each of the 7.1 billion people on the planet, scientists say.

The waste gathers in vast oval-shaped ocean "garbage patches" formed by converging currents and winds. Once trapped in these zones, plastic particles may persist for centuries.

The effects of visible plastic debris on the fish, birds, turtles and marine mammals that swallow it are well-documented: clogged intestines, suffocation, loss of vital nutrients, starvation.

## Plastic Particles In Some Barnacles

But the effects of the minuscule pieces that make up the plastisphere are only beginning to be understood.

Microbial ecologist Edward Carpenter first reported that microbes could attach themselves to plastic particles adrift at sea in 1972. He observed that these particles enabled the growth of algae – a type of simple marine plant – and probably also bacteria. Carpenter speculated that hazardous chemicals showing up in ocean animals may have leached out of bits of plastic.

Carpenter's discovery went largely unnoticed for decades. But now, scientists are devoting more and more attention to the plastisphere. They are collecting seawater and marine life to analyze the types, sizes and chemical compositions of the plastic fragments they contain. Their findings are shedding new light on the consequences of humanity's addiction to plastic.

"We're changing the basic rhythms of life in the world's oceans, and we need to understand the consequences of that," said Miriam Goldstein, a marine biologist who has studied plastic debris in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch between Hawaii and California.

In October, Goldstein and oceanographer Deb Goodwin reported that one-third of the gooseneck barnacles they collected from the garbage patch had plastic particles in their guts. The typical fragment measured 1.4 millimeters across, not much bigger than a piece of glitter.

Since crabs prey on barnacles, the plastic the barnacles eat may be spreading through the food web, Goldstein and Goodwin reported.

## Microbial Communities Studied

Fish that ingest plastic debris tend to accumulate hazardous substances in their bodies and suffer from liver toxicity. Not only is the plastic itself dangerous, so too are the toxic chemicals the plastic has absorbed.

Other scientists have studied the microbial communities that colonize plastic marine debris.

Researchers have identified more than 1,000 different types of bacteria and algae attached to seaborne plastic. Of particular concern was the discovery of bacteria that cause cholera and other gastrointestinal ailments. Such bacteria could travel long distances by attaching themselves to plastic debris.

The team is now comparing microbial communities on plastic debris collected in the North Pacific and North Atlantic oceans. They are trying to understand the bacteria that feed on their waste products, and predators that feed on all of them.

"Each one of these plastic bits is a circle of life — one microbe's waste is another microbe's dinner," Mincer said. "We want to know more about how some microbes may be hanging out on plastic trash, just waiting to be eaten by fish so they can get into that environment."

"These microplastic worlds right under our noses are the next ocean frontier," said Drew Talley, a marine scientist at the University of San Diego. "It would be a crime not to investigate the damage they might be doing to the oceans and to humans."
