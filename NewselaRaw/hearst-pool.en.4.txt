SAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif. â€” Visitors to the luxurious Hearst Castle will soon find something not so fancy: dry fountains and an empty pool. It's because California is suffering one of the worst droughts in its history.

Springs that supply the estate, built by publisher William Randolph Hearst, are running at just one-sixth normal. Only 47,000 gallons a day now flow from the springs. That's down from an average of 285,000 gallons a day.

Three nearby reservoirs are usually filled with 2.75 million gallons of water this time of year. Now, they are only about a third full. That little water is not enough to carry the Castle through the summer.

So it doesn't make any sense to keep filling up the outdoor Neptune Pool. The pool has several cracks. Each day, it loses 3,000 to 5,000 gallons of water through leaks.

## Drying Pool, Quiet Fountains

The State Parks Department is putting the 345,000 gallons of water that were in the pool to good use. They are being used to water the Castle's garden and grounds.

The fancy marble-lined pool is 95 by 104 feet long. It goes down to 10 feet deep. Soon it will be empty, but it's unclear how long that will take.

It depends on how much water is used for the Castle's garden, said Nick Franco, a superintendent with State Parks. On Monday, the pool was down 5 or 6 feet.

"You know the statue of Venus in the back with her rising out of the water?" he asked. "Well, she's not in the water anymore."

Also dry and quiet are the Castle's six fountains. These usually provide the soothing sound of tinkling water for visitors strolling in the garden. "They splash," Franco said, and "lose water." Not a lot of water, "but we want to save every drop we can."

State Parks employees are also deciding which of the garden's plants to save. Franco said they need to figure out what "can survive with very little water."

Usually this time of year, Franco said, State Parks brings in "thousands of annuals." These are plants that live only a short time, then need to be replaced. They won't be doing that this year, though.

State Parks buses are not getting washed, except for their windows. So buses shuttling visitors to the Castle will be a bit dirty.

## Waiting For Rain

The indoor Roman Pool will remain full, however. It isn't leaking like the Neptune Pool. Keeping the Roman Pool full will increase the supply of water that can be used by State Parks.

The Roman Pool will also serve an important purpose. State Parks must keep 200,000 gallons of water stored in case of fire. The Castle used to rely on reservoir water. Now that water can be used for other things.

The Hearst Castle Visitor Center now has low-flow toilets that use little water, Franco said. But that only helps so much: The Castle has 700,000 visitors a year. Low-flow or not, there's still going to be a lot of toilet-flushing.

How long the outdoor Neptune Pool will remain empty is uncertain. It "depends on the weather," Franco said. Divers examined cracks in the pool last fall. Once those are repaired, the pool will no longer leak.

But even after those repairs, the pool and fountains won't be filled up right away. There will first have to be a lot more rain.

For now, there's a 4-foot-high metal fence around the outdoor pool. It's there to make sure nobody falls in.

Grumblings were heard already on Tuesday. Tour groups were not happy when they reached the mostly empty pool. Its blue waters are changing to a clear white as levels get lower.

"I expect people will be disappointed," Franco said, "but I think they will understand. Just look at the hills."
