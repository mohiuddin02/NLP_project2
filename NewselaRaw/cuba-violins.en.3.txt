Silently, they measure the angles of violin pegs and viola necks. The instruments around them are bent out of tune from years of use.

Here in Cuba's capital city Havana, Andres Martinez and his two apprentices are doing what they can to help solve a problem. A country famous for its music is running low on musical instruments.

Cuba's dozens of free music schools turn out thousands of skilled young musicians each year. Many play imported instruments that can only be repaired with hard-to-find materials from overseas. String instruments are among the hardest to keep in good working order.

## Old Quality Versus New Cheap Stuff

Before Cuba's 1959 revolution, many students played violins, violas, cellos and bass violins from European workshops. After its revolution, all that changed. It was cut off from doing business with many countries. Getting Western European instruments became much more difficult.

For many years, Russia provided Cuba with violins and cellos. These days, students must make do with inexpensive violins from China. Of poorer quality, Chinese violins pop strings and lose their tone too easily.

Martinez and his apprentices repair dozens of instruments a year. They also make a handful from scratch. In addition, they train young people in the skills of violin making, in an attempt to create a Cuban violin business.

Martinez, 41, says they "do everything here" from minor repairs to major fixes. "It's a profession that requires a lot of dedication."

## So Many Instruments Need Help

Martinez's workshop opened three years ago. Since then, he has overseen the repair of more than 400 violins, violas, cellos and bass violins. He has also manufactured a dozen high-quality violins for professional musicians. The workshop also lends instruments to musicians who need them for concerts.

Martinez uses high-end imported tools and varnishes for his repairs. He takes pride in the quality of his work. Such quality, he says, can't be found among amateur repairmen who use hammers to fix violins.

"Fiddle making isn't carpentry," he said.

In the past, Cuba did have a handful of world-class violin repairmen, but they have since left the country or died. Martinez's workshop is making up for their absence.

"This workshop fills a great need," music expert Miriam Escudero said.

## Keeping The Workshop Running

Cuba did open a violin factory during the 1970s. However, when it comes to making musical instruments, Cuba's native cedar wood has nowhere near the quality of the best European woods like maple.

Right now, Martinez's workshop needs money from outside groups to stay in operation. Some of that support comes from a Belgian group called Fiddlemakers Without Frontiers. Martinez says his next challenge will be making enough money so the workshop can survive on its own.

The future of Cuban music may depend, in a small way, on his success or failure.

"It's like with people," said workshop apprentice Juan Carlos Prado. "If you feel bad, you need a doctor. The same thing happens with a musical instrument. If it isn't working well, you can hear it in the music."
