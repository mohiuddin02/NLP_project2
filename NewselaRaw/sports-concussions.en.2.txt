College athletes who get through the season concussion-free may not be completely in the clear, new research suggests.

Football and ice hockey players who had no obvious sign of head injuries showed worrisome changes in brain structure. The athletes also did worse on mental performance tests following the season. Those changes weren't shared by athletes who competed in sports such as track and cross-country skiing. The results are in a report in the magazine Neurology.

The findings add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that a season of small hits may cause changes in the brain. Those changes cause problems with memory, mood or mental performance years down the road. The changes come even though none of the individual hits may be that hard. They may not cause a player to seem disoriented or to draw medical attention.

Players may heal during the off-season. Scientists are still trying to figure out how readily the brain recovers from injury. They also want to know whether there are points beyond which damage can add up or be irreversible.

## Hits Hurt Mental Performance ...

The new results don't resolve the matter. But they do suggest that repetitive blows to the head can cause major problems, even when an athlete is able to get up and keep playing, said study leader Thomas McAllister. He is a psychiatrist at Indiana University. Psychiatrists help treat mental problems.

Finding and managing brain injuries like [concussions](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=concussions) matters, McAllister said. But it may not be enough, he added.

The study centered on 159 students at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. The students played on teams between 2007 and 2011. Except for football, all of the sports were played by both men and women. McAllister worked at Dartmouth until last year.

The 80 athletes who played contact sports wore devices in their helmets. The devices measured the number and force of blows to the head during all practices and games. In addition, all of the study participants got MRI brain scans. And they took mental performance tests before and after their seasons.

The researchers looked only at athletes who were not diagnosed with a concussion during the season. Concussions are a type of brain injury. The researchers drew important connections between blows to the head and changes in brain structure. They also found changes in mental performance weeks after the season ended.

MRI measured the brain's white matter. White matter are bundles of fatty tissue that send electrical signals among nerve cells. The scans showed that after a single season, football and hockey players experienced changes that were greater than anything seen in the brains of the athletes who played noncontact sports. The players who had the biggest changes in white matter also did the worst on postseason tests of verbal learning and memory.

## ... But Brain Bounces Back

McAllister said there was good news. Despite years of playing their sports, the white matter of contact-sport athletes at the start of their seasons was largely the same as that of athletes in noncontact sports. That suggests the brains of college athletes may largely bounce back from a season's wear and tear.

But it will take far more research to determine whether there are certain athletes who don't heal as well. There could also be athletes for whom small changes in the brain structure can have larger effects. Those effects might also not show up until later.

"We know some of them heal. But some of them don't," said Eric Nauman of Purdue University. Nauman has spent five years tracking the effects of small and large hits in high school football.

There on limits of how well MRIs can detect white matter changes. That means the fact that differences were seen in the Dartmouth athletes is remarkable, Nauman said.

"We're desperately trying to figure out what the long-term implications are," said Nauman. He was not involved in the study

McAllister said his initial goal was to find a cut off for hits that were safe and hits that caused concussions. But years of study have made him suspect that if that line exists, it may tell only part of the story.

Blows to the head change the brain's structure and the way it works, at least temporarily, he said. This happens a long time before the hits cause a concussion. And there's growing evidence that a succession of those smaller hits puts players at higher risk for the one that finally leads to a concussion, McAllister said.

Making too much about the size of a single hit is wrong, he said.
