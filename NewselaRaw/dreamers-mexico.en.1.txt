MEXICO CITY — For so long, Nancy Landa kept secrets.

Growing up in South Los Angeles, she never told friends that her parents had brought her illegally from Mexico when she was 9.

In college, she was elected to be the first-ever Latina student body president at Cal State Northridge and, after graduating, went on to work in government. All the while, she didn't tell her co-workers that she was facing deportation. Because she was not a legal resident of the United States, it was only a matter of time before she would be forced to move to Mexico. For a long time, she didn't even tell her boyfriend.

The immigration agents came one morning in 2009 while she was turning onto the freeway to go to work. They took her across the border to Mexico and dropped her off that night in Tijuana where she had to start over with zero connections.

## Like "Poking At A Wound"

She tried to forge relationships and plan a new future but she had trouble letting go of the U.S., the country in which she grew up. Every time she glimpsed the border fence, just a few blocks from her apartment, her sadness returned. It felt "like someone poking at a wound," she said.

Then Landa found out about a new social movement of people like her who grew up in the U.S. but returned to Mexico. With their help, she took control of her new life and began to demand changes to both Mexican and U.S. laws.

With them, she no longer had to keep secrets.

They call themselves "Los Otros Dreamers" — "The Other Dreamers." It is a reference to the "Dreamers," the name given to young immigrants living in the U.S. who would benefit from the Dream Act, a proposed law that if passed would provide a path to citizenship for some immigrants who were brought to America illegally as children.

## Unusual Call Centers

Unlike the Dreamers, Los Otros Dreamers would not benefit from the Dream Act. The new law would let children who have grown up in the U.S. stay there, but there is no such hope for people who have already left or been kicked out of the U.S.

Los Otros Dreamers formed a couple of years ago with the help of Jill Anderson, an American researcher in Mexico City. Her involvement began when she noticed something strange about a call center near her house.

Call centers provide telephone services to help customers with their products. If your Internet doesn't work, for example, you can call a technical support number and speak to someone at a call center.

The person who answers may be located almost anywhere in the world and many American companies set up call centers in other countries in order to save money. The call center near Anderson's Mexico City home was unusual, though. The employees there dressed in American clothes and spoke English with Southern California accents. "They really seemed like they were from Los Angeles," she said.

## Perfect English, Teased In Spanish

Anderson began a study of call centers and found that many of the employees in Mexican centers were people who grew up in the U.S. Their perfect English made them ideal candidates to help American callers.

Anderson said that every person she interviewed at these call centers who used to live in the U.S. had experienced feelings of depression and isolation upon returning to Mexico. She encouraged them to start organizing among themselves to try to support each other.

Some returning immigrants describe being teased for their imperfect Spanish and for not knowing the basics of Mexican culture and history. Others find themselves isolated in the rural communities, struggling to make connections with family members.

Landa experienced difficulties like these in her first months in Tijuana, and also found herself unable to find work or continue her education. Her degree from Cal State Northridge put her in a position to succeed in the U.S., but it got her nowhere in Mexico. Eventually she found a job at a call center. She was not allowed to return to the U.S., but all of the sudden she was spending all her time talking to Americans over the phone.

## Swapping Stories, Seeking Change

"It was weird," she said. "Especially the people who were calling from California."

Last year, Landa saw a message Anderson had posted online, asking for people who had been forced to return to Mexico to share their stories. She responded to the message and, thanks to Anderson, she was soon communicating with dozens of people like her.

Landa said that their first conversations together were emotional with members of the new group tearfully swapping stories of their struggles. Over time, though, they started talking about policy changes that would make life easier for people like them.

Now, they are working to make their voices heard. They have met with Mexican officials to argue in favor of speeding up the process for returnees seeking local IDs so they can work and have called on Mexican universities to let students who grew up in the U.S. pick up their educations in Mexico where they left off, rather than having to start again from scratch.
