LAS VEGAS, Nev. — Defiant Republican governors had a message for President Barack Obama on Wednesday. They demanded he suspend plans to resettle thousands of Syrian refugees in their states.

The governors claimed it would be all but impossible to identify terrorists hidden among the refugees. Furthermore, they said, it would be particularly risky to admit the refugees so soon after the recent deadly attacks in Paris.

The attacks in Paris were carried out by the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS. It left 129 people dead and hundreds wounded.

None of the suspects in the Paris attacks has been identified as a Syrian refugee. Nonetheless, the attacks have hardened opposition to accepting Syrian refugees.

Millions have fled Syria since a violent civil war broke out in 2011. Hundreds of thousands have not yet found a permanent place in which to resettle. Over the past four years, 2,200 Syrian refugees have been allowed into the United States. The U.S. has pledged to take in at least 10,000 more over the next year.

## U.S., France Join Forces In Bombing Syria

Both the United States and France are involved in Syria's civil war. The two countries are supporting rebels seeking to topple Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Both countries have been bombing targets in Syria.

The Islamic State group is involved in the fighting in Syria as well and has taken control of parts of the country. It is trying to establish a country in Syria and Iraq under Islamic law. The United States is now seeking to remove Assad and to defeat the Islamic State group.

That group has claimed that the attacks in Paris were meant to punish France for its involvement in the Syrian bombing campaign. Some fear that the Islamic State group or other extremist groups might be planning to strike the United States next. They worry that extremist fighters could slip in with the Syrian refugees.

State leaders from New Mexico to Michigan pleaded with the president to suspend the refugee program — at least for the moment. Some governors claimed they have the legal authority to block the federal resettlement efforts on their own.

"We have the independent authority to completely shut down these refugee relocation programs," Texas Governor Greg Abbott declared. "The states are saying we are not going to accept any more of these refugees" until the government comes up with an effective screening method.

## States Don't Control Refugee Resettlement

Despite the tough talk, it may not be that easy for states to turn away the refugees.

The Refugee Act of 1980 lays out the way in which refugees are to be handled. The law declares that refugee resettlement is managed by the federal government, not the states. The federal government does consult with state refugee coordinators. However, the purpose of that consultation is to ensure the refugees are settled in cities with enough jobs, housing and social services.

Individual states do not have the legal authority to block refugee placement.

Nonetheless, that did not stop Indiana Governor Mike Pence from acting on his own. This week he issued an executive order blocking money to aid resettlement in his state.

Pence said the resettlement program requires collaboration between the federal government and states. "What we've essentially said is, 'We're not collaborating with you.'"

Pence encouraged Obama to reconsider his plan to block legislation just passed by the House of Representatives. The proposed legislation would institute new screening rules for Syrian and Iraqi refugees.

## New Screening Layers At Heart Of Debate

Such refugees currently go through a thorough screening process that can take as long as three years. The House bill would add a new rule that would require every refugee to be officially declared safe by three high-level government officials: the Homeland Security secretary, the head of the FBI and the director of National Intelligence.

The change would not make Americans any safer, the White House said. Instead, it would only create "significant delays and obstacles" for the thousands of refugees much in need of a new place to call home.

It is unclear whether the bill would be enough to satisfy Republican governors even if it becomes law.

"If you really care about those people in Syria, why not take and put the resources in Syria instead of bringing hundreds of thousands of Syrians here?" South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley asked.

## Governor Asks Party To Be More Open-minded

Michigan Governor Rick Snyder encouraged other Republican governors to maintain a welcoming tone in the refugee debate. Some Republicans fear that their party's opposition to the president's plan could be seen as being anti-Islamic.

Snyder, for example, condemned Republicans who suggested that only Christian Syrians be allowed into the United States.

"I don't think that line's ever been drawn in our country's history. And I don't think that would be an appropriate line to draw," he said.

However, Snyder has joined other Republican governors in urging the president to "pause" the resettlement program until safety concerns are addressed.

"I don't want to assume that there's a problem at this point. I just want to make sure we're doing the appropriate reviews," Snyder said. "It shouldn't be a real long pause."
