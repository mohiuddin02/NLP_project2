PALO ALTO, Calif. — For 112 years, Ford Motor Company, a car manufacturer, has been located in Detroit, Michigan. Last January, it set up a new research center in Palo Alto, in the area of Northern California known as Silicon Valley. The Valley is home to many high-tech companies. It got its nickname from silicon, a material used in many computer parts.

Dragos Maciuca, director of Ford's new center, once worked for Apple. He said that for the first 100 years that there were cars, manufacturing them was simple. They mainly had to be built and assembled. Today, however, software has become an important part of carmaking. Because of this, opening Ford's new research center in Silicon Valley makes sense, he said.

At Ford's center, a team of 100 people is studying how humans deal with machines. They are testing self-driving vehicles, or cars driven by computers. They are writing software that examines how bicycles and cars interact on the road.

Ford's new offices are just one example of the move of carmakers to California. Other automotive giants with Valley offices include Toyota, Honda and BMW.

## Money For Electric Car Companies

Although some might find the move of car companies to California surprising, it is anything but sudden. The state has led development of self-driving cars, advanced green vehicles and automotive software. California is very concerned with the environment, and the money it offers to electric car companies has helped the companies to grow.

California has long played an important role in the auto industry. California is a center of style and is home to design studios for Honda, Toyota, Ford and other car makers.

California is also the birthplace of tech-driven taxi apps such as Uber and Lyft, and car-sharing companies such as Turo and Getaround. Many say that partnerships between the state's tech and auto companies might soon lead to a time when riders can order driverless taxis.

"We have the best software engineers in the country, and the most of them," said Pasquale Romano, chief executive of ChargePoint Inc. The company is building a large network of electric car charging stations. California has all the parts necessary to to make it "the next Detroit," he said.

## Auto Industry Brings More Jobs

The growing presence of car companies in the Valley is in part a response to Google's push into the car business with self-driving car development. Google, a leader in the development of self-driving cars, has been testing them for several years on California streets.

The move of auto companies to Silicon Valley brings job growth as well. Employment at auto companies and car parts makers in California has jumped nearly 26 percent since 2011 to about 47,000 jobs this year. This number is still small when compared with Detroit, however. There are an estimated 326,000 automotive workers employed in Michigan.

California is also challenging as a place to build cars. Labor, real estate and environmental laws are more costly there than in Michigan and many other places.

## State's Industry Has Some Setbacks

California's automotive industry has had its setbacks. Toyota is moving more than 3,000 jobs from California to Plano, Texas, over the next two years. 

Five years ago, Toyota closed a factory it operated in California together with General Motors. As many as 4,700 workers lost their jobs.

Other companies have moved offices to Nevada, because of the money offered by that state to companies who move there.

Despite these problems, the growth of auto businesses in the Valley continues. Tesla is a maker of electric cars, which do not need gas and can be charged by being plugged into a wall socket. It has been hiring more workers in California, as have electric bus builders Proterra and BYD. The automotive tech boom here shows no sign of slowing.

Tesla now owns the factory once owned by Toyota. The jobs there help make up for some of those that were lost when Toyota moved. Even so, it is not clear whether the automotive tech companies and the new area of electric car companies will grow fast enough to replace all of the jobs lost by Toyota workers.

## Google Sees Safer, Self-Driving Cars

Many say that the growing car company presence in Silicon Valley is in part a response to Google's advances in developing self-driving cars. Google is the clear leader in this technology. The company says that self-driving cars will be safer than those driven by people. Google says it will no longer matter if someone is a good driver, as driving will be automated.

Although there are challenges, it is impossible to ignore the exciting things happening in the auto industry in California. Karma has rented a large factory where it will assemble electric cars. It is competing with Tesla. Karma's cars could be for sale as early as the middle of 2016. This will not be a full-scale auto factory, however. It will have only a few hundred employees. Karma will buy the parts that generate power from BMW, in Germany, and body panels from Canada.

As cars become more and more high-tech, carmaking is changing in some basic ways, said Bill Hampton, publisher of AutoBeat Daily. AutoBeat is a website with a daily report for people in the auto industry.

"You're getting way far away from bending metal and bolting cars together," Hampton said.
