ATLANTA — The state of Georgia is offering to arm school teachers, but school leaders are turning it down. They argue that it doesn't make kids any safer and creates more problems than state lawmakers intended to solve.

A string of attacks at schools and colleges in California, Oregon and Washington state hasn't swayed education officials. They say bluntly that they don't believe guns belong in schools.

"We could give (teachers) all the training in the world as to how to a shoot a gun, but knowing when to shoot poses a major problem," said Steve Smith, the superintendent of the Bibb County School District. "The folks we work with day in and day out don't have that."

The provision was part of a sweeping law that expands where Georgians can legally carry guns, including bars and churches. It took effect July 1. GOP lawmakers pushed the bill through during an election year in the largely pro-gun state. They gave each district the option of arming teachers or staff — but required them to set training standards. The provisions were similar to a program that drew no interest from South Dakota school districts. Education officials said no districts in Georgia are pursuing it so far either.

## Wary About Weapons In Schools

The new law pulled Georgia education leaders into a Second Amendment discussion they say they never wanted.

School officials were quick to express their support for people who legally carry guns. But they were wary about the idea of weapons inside school buildings. There have been several recent attacks on schools, including an Oregon teen who killed a student and then himself at a school and another in a California college town that killed seven, both of which didn't convince the teachers of guns' usefulness.

At least two Georgia district boards have publicly agreed not to create a gun program. Nobody asked for the power to arm staff, said Mark Scott. He is the superintendent of the Houston County School District. Board members in the district were more comfortable relying on police officers stationed in its middle and high schools and upgrading building security, he said.

"The risk far outweighed the benefit," Scott said.

Rural Fannin County is proud of its hunting and gun culture. But even there, school officials haven't embraced the plan. School Superintendent Mark Henson said officials haven't had any conversations about arming teachers, but will ultimately listen to what the community wants.

"This is one we will wring our hands over," Henson said.

## Decision Left To School Boards

Georgia isn't the first state to respond to school violence by allowing staff to carry guns. After 20 children and six adults died during a 2012 elementary school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, at least nine states passed bills in 2013 authorizing armed school workers, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Other states had similar programs in place before that shooting. In 2014, at least 14 more states including Georgia introduced similar bills.

Representative Alan Powell, a Hartwell Republican who chairs the Georgia House of Representatives committee on public safety, said lawmakers intentionally left the decision to school boards. He argued that weapon-free zones are targets.

"You can't control what bad people do," Powell said. "You can only guarantee people their constitutional right to protect themselves."

The idea isn't irrational, but it's only appropriate for schools that are located far away from law enforcement, said Mike Dorn. He is the executive director of the school safety center Safe Havens International.

Dorn said far more often schools face smaller threats. They aren't likely to face a lone shooter intent on killing many. For example, a student with disabilities who gets hold of a screwdriver or a desperate parent caught in a custody battle could pose more problems.

"Everyone's so focused on the last event, picturing a 30- or 40-year-old brandishing an AK-47," Dorn said.

## "Law Maintained Local Control"

Georgia districts don't have to do anything. Creating a program is optional under the new law. Representative Paul Battles, a Cartersville Republican who has backed the idea since 2012, said he's not disappointed that districts aren't using it, but local officials should consider the option if they can't afford police officers in schools.

The Georgia governor's spokesman took a positive view. He said the districts' reluctance to embrace the gun option was "a great example of how the law maintained local control while expanding choices for how best to keep students safe."

Officials involved in district-level conversations said it's unlikely that any board will volunteer as a test case. Phillip Hartley is an attorney who works with the Georgia Schools Boards Association and dozens of local boards. He talked a room of board members through the issue at a recent conference and felt a "reluctance to be the first" without a serious push from parents.

"There just hasn't been that kind of groundswell," Hartley said.
