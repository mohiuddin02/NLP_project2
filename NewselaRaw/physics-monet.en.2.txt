A Texas physicist and art detective says he has figured out the exact minute the Impressionism art movement was born.

Impressionism was a movement where artists used quick brush strokes and vivid colors. They were supposed to capture the "impression" of their subject, instead of making it look realistic. They were especially interested in light and how objects appeared at different times of the day.

Donald Olson is a physicist at Texas State University, San Marcos. According to his calculations, the Impressionism movement began on Nov. 13, 1872, right around 7:35 a.m. local time.

That's the moment Claude Monet began painting a hazy sunrise in LeHavre, France.

## Old Maps And Photos Helped

Monet called the now-famous work "Impression, Soleil Levant" (Impression, Sunrise). Its title was later borrowed to name the art movement.

Art historians have debated where and when Monet's work was painted. Many have mistrusted the shortened date "72" that the artist brushed beside his name. Others even insisted the skies streaked with orange show a sunset, rather than a sunrise.

Olson pored over hundreds of photographs and scores of historical maps of Le Havre. Monet painted the picture from his hotel room in Le Havre, a port town on the Normandy coast of France. Olson eventually determined the exact room that matched the artist's southeast-facing view.

EBay's French site proved to be helpful. Many historical photos have been posted there, Olson said. Those pictures helped him find the structures depicted in another painting, Monet's "Le Grand Quai," which was painted on a balcony of the Hotel de L'Amiraute. A bit of math led Olson to the closest position where Monet likely painted it.

## Calculating The Sun And High Tides

Olson next calculated the sun's height from the horizon and its angle. Those facts determined the time of year and time of day shown in the painting. He settled on late fall or early winter, at 7:30-8:30 a.m. local time.

Fellow Texas State physicist Ed Piner offered the next breakthrough, Olson said. The tall, multiple-masted ships in the painting could only have been in the distant outer harbor if the tides were high.

"That suggests you're looking at a high tide, near a rising sun," Olson said. But that only narrowed the possibilities to 19 dates. They ranged from November 1872 to January 1873.

Much to Olson's surprise, a large source of 19th century daily weather observations in Le Havre harbor went online recently. He matched the sky and weather conditions to six dates in that period. Olson then narrowed them down to two days when the winds blew from the east. Smoke in Monet's painting drifts slightly from east to west.

On Nov. 15, 1872, at 7:35 a.m., the weather observer noted light winds from the southeast. He described mist, fog and calm seas.

"All of the times I was considering were between 7:30 and 8:30 a.m.," Olson said. He calls himself a "celestial sleuth" â€” a detective of the heavens. "So, on exactly the time of day I want to know about, we have a guy looking at the water and looking at the sky. The guy was out there every day at 8 in the morning."

A weather report on Jan. 25, 1873, also matched conditions and other information. However, Monet experts chose the November date, since Monet dated his painting "72."

## Science Successfully Meets Art

This was not the first time Olson applied science to art. He and his research team examined another Impressionist artist's work, Edvard Munch's "The Scream." They linked the painting's intense orange sky with gases and ash from the 1883 Krakatoa volcanic eruption.

They also dated a Monet painting of a sunset near the cliffs on the Normandy coast and works by Vincent Van Gogh. Olson figured out where photographer Ansel Adams took a picture of an autumn moon from Glacier Point in Yosemite National Park in California. He organized a re-enactment of the picture in 2005.

Olson had puzzled over Monet's sunrise picture for 15 or more years, putting it aside for other projects. After he published his research on the other Monet painting in February, French art experts urged Olson to take another look at the Le Havre sunrise. They were planning an exhibition around the painting and wanted to know when it was painted.

The museum published a "biography" of the Monet work, co-written by Olson, to go along with the exhibit. The exhibit opens Sept. 18 at the Musee Marmottan Monet in Paris, France, and runs through Jan. 18, 2015.
