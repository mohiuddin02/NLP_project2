Most people don't realize how much goes into walking. It takes balance, strength and brainpower.

Zac Vawter understands what it takes to walk. He was in a motorcycle accident in 2009. He lost his leg. But now he is working with a new type of artificial leg. A team of scientists and doctors created it for him. Vawter has taught it how to walk, kick and do everything else that a leg does.

A lot of people go into making a robotic leg.

The team includes scientists who develop software and study the brain. There are surgeons and people who make artificial limbs. Those limbs are called prosthetics. Together, they designed a prosthetic leg that can "talk" with Vawter's brain.

## Getting The Message From Nerves

The leg has learned to receive messages about what Vawter wants it to do. Vawter has a bundle of nerves that end above his missing knee. The nerves give signals to the leg, a scientific report said.

About 1 million Americans have lost a leg or part of one. Vawter and his robotic leg offer hope that future prosthetics might feel more natural.

The engineering of Vawter's new leg is amazing. But Vawter's ability to control the prosthetic with his thoughts is what makes his case remarkable. If he wants his artificial toes to curl toward him all he has to do is imagine the movements. The same with shifting his artificial ankle so he can walk down a ramp.

The work was done at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago. The Army paid $8 million for the study. About 1,200 service men and women have lost a leg in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The armed forces hope studies like this one will help them.

"We want to restore full capabilities" to people who have lost a leg, said Levi J. Hargrove. He worked on the study.

The leg weighs just over 10 pounds. It has two engines. Those make the ankle and knee move. And the moving is much easier than standard fake limbs.

## Special Computer Programming

"With this leg, it just flows," said the 32-year-old software engineer. "There isn't anything special I have to do to make it work right." Vawter lives in Washington. Most of the time he uses a typical prosthetic. But he travels to Chicago several times a year to work with the robotic leg.

Vawter couldn't just strap on the special leg. First engineers in Chicago had to "teach" the leg how to read tiny muscle movements in his right thigh. Those movements told the leg what Vawter wanted it to do.

Vawter spent hours with his thigh wired up. He imagined doing certain things with his missing knee, ankle and foot.

Engineers took Vawter's signals and turned them into the commands for an entire collection of movements. A special computer program helped them do this. The prosthetic could then be programmed to recognize the smallest move of a muscle in Vawter's thigh.

It took a new type of operation to make this possible, though. In most amputations, the nerves in the thigh are left to die.

## Would Love To Wear It Home

Dr. Todd Kuiken is a doctor at the rehabilitation institute. He operates on the brain. He developed the new method. It is called "reinervation." Vawter's surgeon was trained in the delicate operation. He rewired the nerves to control some of the muscles in Vawter's thigh.

Those nerves recovered from the injury. Then they began to grow again. They could carry electrical signals. When Vawter thought about flexing his right foot in a particular way, the nerve endings would cause a special motion in his hamstring. The same sort of thing happened with other muscle movements.

A fake leg can make errors. They can lead to pain and falls. The special leg Vawter uses makes 44 percent fewer errors.

Vawter said he had "fallen down a whole bunch of times" while wearing his everyday prosthetic. He has not fallen once while moving around on his special leg.

He said he could move a lot faster too. Moving faster would be helpful for keeping up with his 5-year-old son and 3-year-old daughter. But first, he needs Hargrove's team to let him wear it home.
