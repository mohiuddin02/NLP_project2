During the study, teens were selected to join a jobs program for eight weeks. The youths who were offered jobs were arrested for violent crimes less often than other teenagers.

It is not just because the teenagers were too busy working to break the law, either. The teens who worked were not arrested as much even after the study ended in 2012. The effects of the program lasted a long time.

## They Learned Important Skills

Sara Heller, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, led the research. Her findings were published last week in the magazine Science. Most of the teenagers in the study were from families without a lot of money. One out of every five teens in the study had been arrested before.

Heller said it is too early to know why the summer jobs program helped teens stay out of trouble for so long after it ended.

One reason may be that the teens learned important skills while working. Through their jobs, they learned how to handle problems and control their moods and actions. Skills like those help at work, in school, with friends or at home. The new skills might have helped keep youths out of trouble with the law.

The teens in the study were also given an adult mentor. The mentor helped guide the teens and give advice about work and life. Heller said that the study's findings are "surprising and really exciting."

## Teens Staying Out Of Trouble

The Chicago program was called One Summer Plus. The teens in the program were paid $8.25 for every hour they worked. Each one worked 25 hours per week.

One Summer Plus is cheaper and shorter than many other programs. It also seemed to help the teens stay out of trouble longer than other programs.

Researchers said the study was designed well. One expert named Dan Bloom said it provides more information about teenage employment than researchers knew before.

There were 1,634 kids who applied to take part in the study. Of those, 730 teenagers were picked. The study compared the number of arrests by the teens who were picked to be in the study with the ones who were not.

Heller said it was too soon to know for sure whether the program was a good use of money. Researchers will need to collect more information on the teenagers, like if they find jobs in the future and how long they work. This will take time. Still, Heller said there are other types of evidence that could show the program is working. The jobs program may save the justice system money and if there are fewer crimes, victims will suffer less.

## Starting Out Slowly

Yet the study was not all good news. While the number of violent crimes was lower among teens in the study, the number of nonviolent crimes was not.

Teens in the study held many different types of jobs, including serving as a day-camp counselor, cleaning empty city lots, planting community gardens, and performing office work for companies.

Teens did not always have the most exiting projects during their jobs. The researchers thought it was important to teach them that not every job is perfect, especially your first job.
