CHICAGO, Ill. — Smoking is bad for a person's health. It can make people sick and die early. Sometimes people start smoking when they are teenagers. 

Scientists did research into tobacco. They found that there may be a way for teenagers to stop smoking.

Most people can buy cigarettes when they are at least 18 years old. The study found that raising the age to 21 years old would make a big difference. Teenagers would be less likely to smoke.

Rahm Emanuel is the mayor of Chicago. It is a big city in Illinois. Last week, he announced a new plan for his city. The plan would make it illegal for anyone under the age of 21 to buy cigarettes. 

## Keeping Teens From Tobacco 

Many people start smoking when they are teenagers. They can become addicted. It is hard for them to stop. The new law would make it harder to start smoking in the first place.

The idea is getting more popular. More than 100 cities have changed their laws. The new laws say you have to be 21 to buy cigarettes.    

Lila Johnson lives in Hawaii. It is a small island state in the Pacific Ocean. She works for her state government. She tries to keep people healthy.  

##  Hawaii Alone Requires Buyers To Be 21

She said the study was important to government leaders in Hawaii. It made lawmakers want to change the law. In Hawaii, everyone has to be 21 years old to buy cigarettes. Hawaii is the only state in the country that has this law.  

The mayor of Chicago is doing other things to keep teenagers from smoking. He wants to make cigarettes cost more. This would make it harder for young people to buy cigarettes.  

Chicago city leaders are preparing to talk about the mayor's plan.
