CHICAGO, Ill. — Sophia Pellar used to have pain in her ears when she played flute in her high school pep band. The pain ended after an ear doctor donated some special earplugs to her.

The earplugs are designed to protect musicians from hearing loss. Still, the Mozart-loving New Trier High School sophomore giggles nervously when she explains that the earplugs have yet to become part of her regular routine.

Sophia, 16, said it "can be crazy loud" during pep band season. She wears the earplugs then. "But the thought of wearing them every day is a little embarrassing," she said.

## Hearing Should Be Protected

Research indicates that as many as 1 in 5 teens suffers from hearing loss. Much of that hearing loss is caused by noise damage. So more doctors and school band directors are urging kids to protect their hearing. In some cases, they provide earplugs. Yet experts say their messages are not working as well as they can because people think it is "uncool" to wear earplugs. The same thinking once kept people from using bike helmets, shin guards and sunscreen.

The music educators now being trained at colleges and universities are learning that they should teach the importance of students protecting their hearing during rehearsals and performances. Still, officials say that even the most cautious parents typically are unaware of the need for their children to take steps to be safe.

Sophia's mother is Chimene Pellar. She said she became alarmed recently when she learned that Sophia is often in pain after playing her flute in close ranks with her fellow musicians.

"I had never thought of it at all ... and she has been playing the flute since she was in fourth grade," said Pellar, a physician. "I also have concerns when I walk by my kids when they have their earbuds in and I can still hear their music. And the longer they listen, the louder it seems to get."

## More Teens Have Some Hearing Loss

Audiologists who study teen hearing loss say loud music from instruments, concerts and earbuds — as well as other loud noises — can harm the hair cells in the inner ear, or cochlea. The result is hearing damage that builds up over time and is irreversible.

"We're seeing a rise in the number of adolescents with hearing loss, which is not a surprise when you look at our society, which has gotten busier, nosier and overstimulated," said Dr. Henry Ou, a professor of ear, nose and throat medicine at Seattle Children's Hospital.

"Sound is just energy," Ou said, and when it is too loud, it "can cause damage."

The National Association for Music Education urges teachers and band directors to address the dangers of hearing loss caused by noise. They suggest, for example, ensuring that students are not performing at high volume levels for an extended time.

"It's something music educators talk to their students about all the time," said Michael Butera, the association's executive director.

Music teachers and band directors can encourage behavior, Butera said. Requiring student musicians to wear earplugs is another matter entirely.

Teachers "don't have the power of the school boards or the states, and the first time you talk about any regulations or mandates, everyone goes nuts," Butera said. "But it's important for teachers to be aware of the hearing loss issue and for them to be able to discuss it with their students."

## Ear Doctors Help

At Barrington High School, band director Randy Karon said he often talks to his students about the need to protect their hearing. They need to do this both during rehearsals and performances and outside of the band program, too, Karon said.

"My general rule is, if your ear feels uncomfortable at any time, put a pair of earplugs in," Karon said. He even keeps a large jar in the band room stocked with foam earplugs for his students.

Karon has played trumpet and directed student musicians for many years and said he is increasingly aware of the need to protect his own hearing.

"Music is my livelihood, and if I can't hear, I'm in trouble," he said.

At New Trier, band director Matt Temple's music program is one of 400 nationwide participating in Etymotic Research's Adopt-a-Band program. The program pairs schools with local ear doctors willing to donate earplugs to students.

## You Can Hardly See Them!

Etymotic is a company that manufactures earplugs. Officials there said the reluctance of some teens and adults to be seen wearing earplugs helped inspire its newly designed earplugs that are smaller and less obvious.

But Temple said only time will tell if his young musicians will wear their new earplugs beyond pep band season.

He said a lot of the drummers and percussion members "already have form-fitted earplugs, and they wear them a lot." However, Temple added that many teenagers think they can't be hurt.

"I think the most important thing I'm doing is wearing earplugs myself," Temple added. "The kids know I'm not the least bit shy about it. ... I put them in my ears, and I look out at my students and smile."
