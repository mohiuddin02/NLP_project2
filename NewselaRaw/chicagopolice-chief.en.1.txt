The head of the Chicago Police Department was fired Tuesday amid widespread criticism over a fatal shooting last year. Public outrage centers on the way authorities responded to the incident.

Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said he formally asked Garry McCarthy, the Chicago police superintendent, for his resignation. Emanuel's request came a week after a video of the shooting was released and the officer was charged with murder. The police officer Jason Van Dyke, who is white, fired the fatal shots at Laquan McDonald, a 17-year-old black teen.

McCarthy "has become an issue, rather than dealing with the issue, and a distraction," Emanuel said. He added that while he is loyal to McCarthy, whom he praised for his leadership of the department, the needs of the city are more important.

Emanuel said he began talking to McCarthy on Sunday, after several days of heated protests and anger over the shooting. Emanuel said he discussed "the undeniable fact that the public trust in the leadership of the department has been shaken and eroded."

## Mayor Wants To Restore Trust

Emanuel said he had "a lot of confidence in the work" McCarthy has done. However, the mayor added that it was necessary to fire McCarthy to rebuild public trust and confidence in the police force.

City leaders and demonstrators have called for Emanuel to remove McCarthy, arguing that new leadership is needed to reassure a troubled public. Last week, a dozen African-American members of the city council gathered to call for new leadership.

Outrage has mounted over the long lag between McDonald's death in October 2014 and last week's release of the video and charges against Van Dyke. In the meantime, Emanuel was re-elected to a second term as Chicago's mayor.

## Police Statement Called Mistake

Since the video's release, Emanuel has said he fully supported McCarthy. He held this position publicly until word leaked shortly before the news conference that he had asked McCarthy to step down.

As recently as Tuesday morning, McCarthy was giving interviews to reporters and responding to the calls for him to resign.

McCarthy acknowledged missteps, saying in an interview with NBC Chicago that the initial press release about the shooting "was mistaken." The statement put out by the police department said that the teenager had continued to approach officers and ignored orders to drop his knife,

In addition, a spokesman for the police union had said that McDonald lunged at police with a knife. Last week, that spokesman said he was relaying information told to him by other people on the scene and that he never spoke with Van Dyke.

## Task Force Will Focus On Police

But McCarthy said his authority in the Van Dyke case was limited. He said that an outside agency and federal officials investigated what happened.

"The things that I have authority over are training, policy and supervision," he said.

McCarthy also defended how the city has responded to the protests that have erupted since the shooting video was released last week. He praised the "incredible restraint by officers."

However, calls for McCarthy's ouster have continued in the days since the video was released. On Tuesday, the Chicago Sun-Times released an editorial saying McCarthy "has lost the trust and support of much of Chicago."

In addition to announcing that McCarthy would step down, Emanuel also said he had created a task force focused on police accountability. The task force is meant to improve independent oversight of the police and the way authorities respond to police officers who receive multiple complaints. Right now, the city does not release video footage of police shootings. The task force is also meant to determine if the city should change that policy.

This group's recommendations will be presented to Mayor Emanuel and the Chicago City Council at the end of March, he said.
