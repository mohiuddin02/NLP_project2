LOS ANGELES — Steven Beitashour is an American soccer player, but don't look for him on the U.S. team in this summer's World Cup.

Beitashour has decided to play for [Iran](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Iran), a country often at odds with the U.S. But Beitashour said his decision had nothing to do with relations between the two countries.

"I just thought about soccer," Beitashour says. "It's a great opportunity, especially to play on the international stage."

If U.S. Soccer had wanted him as much as Iran's national team, he would have been just as happy to stay home in the U.S. But he was never asked to make that choice.

## A Last Chance?

Beitashour was born in California to Iranian parents. His decision to play for Iran has been solely about soccer. He just wants to play in a World Cup.

For the 27-year-old, this summer's tournament in [Brazil](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Brazil) could be his last chance. The World Cup takes place once every four years.

"It's the biggest stage and the best players (are) playing there," says Beitashour, a former Major League Soccer (MLS) all-star. He now plays right back for the Vancouver Whitecaps. "Having an opportunity to potentially be there, it's just great."

He is not there yet. Beitashour first played for Iran last October. The Iranian team still has three friendly matches left before it must decide which players to send to the World Cup. It's not certain Beitashour will get a spot.

But his U.S. background and MLS experience might help. Iran's manager, Carlos Queiroz, is from Portugal. He runs practices in English. And he was also responsible for bringing Beitashour into the Iranian program. After Queiroz took over the national team three years ago, he started looking for players with Iranian backgrounds who were playing all over the world.

## Team Of Brothers

"At the beginning there was a little bit of resistance," says former assistant coach Omid Namazi. "But once that ice broke and players came in and showed what they could bring to the national team, I think it was a sense of welcome."

It certainly was for Beitashour.

"Within five, 10 minutes I felt like they were my brothers," he says of his Iranian teammates.

Beitashour still struggles with the language, Farsi. He hadn't visited Iran since he was 5. But while he was growing up in California's Silicon Valley, his parents followed many Iranian traditions.

"The culture is still part of you," he says. "I definitely feel like I've got strong ties."

Still, his upbringing was also as American as apple pie and weekend visits to the mall.

Beitashour went on to the play at San Diego State. Later, he spent four years with the San Jose Earthquakes of MLS before being sold to Vancouver in January.

## "Down To The Wire"

When Iranian coaches first contacted him three years ago and asked him about visiting the country, playing for Iran wasn't part of his plan. That's because he had also been called into the U.S. national team camp twice.

But Beitashour didn't get into a game, and officials with U.S. Soccer said that it was unlikely he'd ever play for the team.

So when Iran called back, he jumped at the chance to play in a World Cup. U.S. Coach Juergen Klinsmann blessed the decision.

"In our ranking in the right back position, he was five, six, seven. So it was not realistic," says Klinsmann, who played in three World Cups for Germany. "I don't want them to miss out on anything. If this is what they badly want, then absolutely fine."

The next hurdle for Beitashour is being chosen to join the team.

"It's going to go down to the wire," says Namazi, the former assistant coach. "But I have a good feeling that he´ll be on the squad come the World Cup."
