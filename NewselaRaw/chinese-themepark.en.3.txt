LOS ANGELES â€” Edward Marks has dreamed up some of the most exciting amusement park attractions in the United States. His team has invented high-tech rides and glow-in-the-dark parades. They've even made 3-D simulators full of mummies, aliens and crazy clowns.

But to make money from China's theme park boom, Marks needs more than creativity. He must become an expert on Chinese folk stories and superstitions. He also needs a lot of patience.

## Fun With Feng Shui

A building with four roof tops? Don't even think about building one in China. The number 4 sounds like the word for "death" in Chinese. It is considered bad luck, said Marks. He is the head of the Producers Group, a theme park design and construction company.

"We've had to flip entire buildings, move attractions and change elements because of feng shui reasons," Marks said. In Chinese, feng shui means wind-water. Feng Shui is a Chinese belief that buildings must face in certain directions for good luck.

These are welcome challenges for Marks and others in California's theme park business. China is building so many theme parks that their business is booming.

## Jobs For Artists, Designers

The popularity of theme parks overseas is also leading to more jobs here. Many firms cannot even start working on new jobs for six to 12 months. Because of the demand, design firms do not have enough artists, designers and technicians. Marks thinks his 45-person team could grow to 70 by year's end.

American companies earn $500,000 to $7 million to design a theme park in China. More detailed construction plans cost up to $15 million.

In 2013 alone, Chinese developers spent nearly $24 billion on theme park construction, according to AECOM, an engineering company in California. In 2011, Chinese developers spent just $9 billion.

Gary Goddard is the founder of Gary Goddard Entertainment. His company designs theme parks and resorts. He estimated that about half his work recently has been in Asia and the Middle East.

## Looks Like 8? That's Great!

Goddard said his designers are careful to respect the local culture.

A resort in Macau features a double Ferris wheel. It looks like the number 8.

"That was a very deliberate move to make the number 8, " he said. "That is considered a lucky number over there."

China's demand for theme parks has several reasons. China's growing middle class is one of them. They have money to spend, but there are not many places to have fun.

By 2020, AECOM predicts there will be more people going to Chinese amusement parks than American ones. Parks operated by a Chinese company already attract more than 26 million visitors a year.

United States theme park companies are spending a lot of money in Asia.

The $4 billion Shanghai Disney resort is expected to open late this year. The $1.8 billion Hong Kong Disneyland opened in 2005. Universal Studios and Six Flags will have their own parks.

## It's Harder Than It Looks

In China, the parks draw on stories from Chinese history or fairy tales. Parks in the United States and Europe get their themes from movies and books.

Many projects, though, will never be built. Some Chinese developers do not understand how expensive it is to build a theme park, American designers say.

"Until you know how the sausage is made, you don't know how expensive it is to make that sausage," said Josh Updike. He is the creative director of Rethink Leisure &amp; Entertainment. The company is working on several projects in China and other countries in Asia.

Regardless, the Californian theme park industry is growing rich.

"Everyone I know in town is busy," Updike said.

The extra work means designers spend a lot of time flying back and forth to Asia. Goddard has flown 3 million miles. Updike has logged more than 200,000 miles in the air last year alone.
