KENOSHA, Wis. â€” Inside a building next to Lake Michigan, the Civil War rages on. Cannons roar and smoke drifts across a battlefield. Men in blue and gray charge screaming at each other.

America's Civil War pitted brother against brother. Neighbor against neighbor. Northerner against Southerner. By the time the fighting ended, hundreds of thousands were dead or badly injured.

Only those who fought in the Civil War really knew what it was like. But shortly after the war ended, painters began to re-create it in cycloramas. These were round, 360-degree paintings meant to be viewed from inside. They drew curious visitors seeking a taste of war. By standing in the center of the cyclorama, it felt like the war was going on around you.

Now Kenosha's Civil War Museum has updated the cyclorama approach. Using 360-degree technology, the museum has created an 11-minute movie called "Seeing the Elephant." The picture opened this month.

## In The Round, Then And Now

The movie was filmed over five days last summer at Old World Wisconsin, an outdoor history museum. The movie uses 200 re-enactors, who staged the battle scenes. The film follows three men who join the Union Army for different reasons. Each heads off to battle.

"Our idea was to produce a 360-degree film," said museum curator Doug Damman. The movie "puts the viewer in the middle of the action." It's like a "living, breathing cyclorama."

Cycloramas were popular in the late 19th century. First developed in Europe, they migrated to the United States in the 1880s. Many featured huge paintings of Civil War battles.

A handful of cycloramas can still be seen today. One in Atlanta was created with the help of Union and Confederate soldiers.

"In the age before movies and television," Dammann said, there was the cyclorama. "It was a way to transport the viewer" to the battlefield.

Kenosha's Civil War Museum opened in 2008. Plans got underway last year for the film.

The call went out to Civil War re-enactors from the Midwest and elsewhere. Old World Wisconsin was the place chosen for filming. In particular, shooting focused on the Norwegian farming area, the Catholic church and the town hall.

This setting makes the movie seem very realistic, said the film's director, Bob Noll. "Looking in every direction you feel you're in the past."

## Cannon And Musket Fire

A special 360-degree camera was used to film the battle scenes. This was actually nine digital cameras attached to a metal tube. The tube was connected to a large chamber. During filming, Noll and the camera operator huddled inside this chamber. All around them, re-enactors shot blanks at each other.

The battle was carefully mapped out in advance. A coordinator helped design the re-enactors' moves.

"We had a lot of cannon explosions," Noll said. As they were going across the field, blasts and smoke were set off. "Everything was staked out with flags so people wouldn't step on them."

The battle in the museum's movie isn't based exactly on a real-life event. But it is inspired by a real fight. This took place right before the Second Battle of Bull Run as the North called it, or Second Battle of Manassas as the South called it.

"We talked about doing an actual battle," said Civil War historian Lance Herdegen. "But the problem is when you do that some expert" always finds mistakes. They'll say, "Well the fence is in the wrong place."

Most of what the three main characters say is based on fact, Herdegen said. Their words were taken from letters and diaries.

At the Civil War Museum, visitors climb up to a platform. These viewers turn as the action moves around them. The theater has eight projectors and seven speakers placed above the viewers. There are also speakers underneath the platform. The screens are 11 feet high.

And what about the movie's unusual title? This was chosen because "seeing the elephant" was a common expression during the Civil War. It was used by soldiers to describe their first experience of battle.
