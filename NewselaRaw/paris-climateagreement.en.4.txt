LE BOURGET, France — Nearly 200 nations have agreed to work together to fight global warming. The agreement was signed in Paris on Saturday. It is known as the "Paris agreement." 

The countries agreed to lower greenhouse gas pollution.

Greenhouse gases come mostly from the burning of oil, coal and gas. We burn these fuels to make energy. Everything from cars to electric lights runs on this energy. 

Greenhouse gases become trapped in the air above us. They store heat, making the world hotter. Scientists call this global warming.

## Global Warming Can Bring Many Problems

Global warming leads to all sorts of problems. It makes giant ice caps melt. In turn, the world's seas rise. Land begins to disappear under water. Coastlines and small island nations become threatened. 

In other parts of the world, the rising heat may make water dry up. Soon many people could have too little water.

On Saturday there was loud clapping after the agreement was signed. Some people cried and others hugged.

President Barack Obama praised the agreement. He said it offers "the best chance to save the one planet we have."

Izabella Teixeira works for the government of Brazil. "Today, we've proven that it's possible for every country to come together," she said.

Each nation agreed to cut greenhouse gases.

## Millions Of Homes Could Be Saved

Scientist Ben Strauss said the agreement could make a huge difference. The homes of as many as 140 million people could be saved. They might not be lost to rising seas.

Not everyone is happy with the new agreement, though. They wonder if it will really work. 

Countries will have to completely change how they get energy. Doing that is very hard. Many people wonder how many countries will make the needed changes. Countries that do not will not be punished.

## Some Want A Stronger Plan

Many think the new agreement is too weak. Thousands of people marched through Paris over the weekend. They called for a stronger agreement.

Kumi Naidoo works for the group Greenpeace. The agreement is a good start, he said. It is not enough, though. What really matters is what happens later. 

The agreement is very important anyway. Never before have so many countries agreed to cut greenhouse gases. 

French President Francois Hollande said France is ready to cut even more than it promised. He challenged all nations to do more.

Saturday will be remembered for a long time, Hollande said. It was a great day for the planet, he said.
