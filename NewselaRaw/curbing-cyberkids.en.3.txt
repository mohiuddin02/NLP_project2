CHICAGO — Doctors have new advice for parents: Limit kids' time online. They should also keep smartphones and laptops out of bedrooms.

The suggestions are bound to prompt eye-rolling and laughter from many teens. But an important pediatricians group says parents need to know that too much Internet use can have serious results.

It's been linked with violence, cyberbullying, school woes, weight problems, lack of sleep and other issues. True, it's not a major cause of these problems. But "many parents are clueless" about the strong effects Internet use can have on their children, said Dr. Victor Strasburger.

He is the lead writer of the new American Academy of Pediatrics policy. It sets guidelines on what parents should let their kids do with electronic media.

## Limit Kids To Two Hours Daily

"This is the 21st century and they need to get with it," he said. Strasburger is a University of New Mexico doctor of teenage medicine.

The policy is aimed at all kids who use smartphones, computers and other Internet-connected devices. It expands the academy's old advice. The group already said not to put televisions in children's and teens' bedrooms. It also suggests keeping entertainment screen time to no more than two hours a day.

Under the new guidelines, those two hours include using the Internet for entertainment. That would be Facebook, Twitter, TV and movies. Online homework does not count.

A 2010 report found U.S. children aged 8 to 18 spend an average of more than seven hours a day using some kind of entertainment media. Many kids now watch TV online. Many send text messages from their bedrooms after bedtime. Yet few parents set rules about media use.

The policy notes that three-quarters of kids 12 to 17 own cellphones. Nearly all teens send text messages. Many younger kids have phones that are connected to the Internet.

## More Time Online Than In School

"Young people now spend more time with media than they do in school," the policy said. The only thing children and teenagers do more is sleep.

Mark Risinger, 16, of Glenview, Ill., is allowed to use his smartphone and laptop in his room. He says he spends about four hours a day on the Internet. He does homework, uses Facebook and YouTube and watches movies.

He said a two-hour Internet time limit would be a disaster. Kids won't follow the advice, "they'll just find a way to get around it."

Strasburger said he realizes many kids will laugh at advice from pediatricians — or any adults. But he said he hopes it will lead to more limits from parents and schools.

The policy comes two weeks after police arrested two Florida girls. They were accused of bullying a classmate who later killed herself. Police say one of the girls recently boasted online about the bullying. The local sheriff asked why the girls' parents hadn't limited their Internet use.

## "It's Overstimulating" Kids, Mom Says

Mark's mom is Amy Risinger. She said she agrees with limiting kids' time on social media. But deciding on other media limits should be up to parents, she said.

"I think some children have a greater maturity level and you don't need to be quite as strict with them," said Risinger. She runs a communications consulting firm.

Her 12-year-old has sneaked a laptop into bed a few times. He's ended up groggy in the morning. Now there are new rules. "That device needs to be in mom and dad's room before he goes to bed."

Sara Gorr is a San Francisco sales director and mother of two girls, ages 13 and 15. She said she welcomes the academy's guidelines.

Her girls weren't allowed to watch the family's only TV until a few years ago. The younger one has a tablet, and the older one has a computer and smartphone. They're told not to use them after 9 p.m.

"There needs to be more awareness," Gorr said. "Kids are getting way too much computer time. It's bad for their socialization, it's overstimulating, it's numbing them."
