ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. â€” Last year, a black teenager named Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Missouri.

Nothing like that has happened in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. Recently, a group of police officers there met with residents to make sure it never does.

"We know what happened nationally could happen right here," said Archie Jones, who works for the city. In Rocky Mount, 6 out of every 10 people are black. Jones is also black. He helped put together the program, which was called "Know Your Rights."

"We decided it was time to bring the police and the community together," Jones said. Some people may be scared of the police, Jones said. However, some police may be just as afraid of the people they stop.

## How Police Treat Black People

After the Ferguson teen's death, towns and cities across America took a close look at how police treat black people. People have been asking: What happens when a young black man is stopped by the police? How did it end in death in Ferguson?

There has never been a shooting like that in Rocky Mount. However, a few young black men have been profiled or bothered by police, said the Reverend Andre Knight. He is with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), a group that works for the rights of black Americans. Profiling is when a police officer stops, searches or arrests someone because of his race. It is against the law in many places.

In October, Jones attended a meeting about the Ferguson shooting and became worried it could happen in Rocky Mount. Jones spoke to Police Chief James Moore, who said he had the same concerns, so they decided a community meeting was important.

At the meeting, 18-year-old Khristian Roberson listened closely as several police officers answered questions. Most of the officers were black.

## Many Black Parents Give Their Sons "The Talk"

Roberson, who is black, said he was stopped last month by a police officer who said he drove through a red light. Roberson said he immediately thought about the Ferguson shooting.

"I stayed calm. I wasn't rude," Roberson said. He also said he avoided doing anything to anger the officer. Roberson said his parents had often given him "the talk," the set of instructions on how to deal with police, so he knew what to do.

Roberson said he let the officer, who was also black, search his car, and he was let go without a ticket.

"I thought I was treated OK," Roberson said, although his mother thought he may have been stopped because he was black.

Roberson said the police at the meeting helped remind him how to act during a police stop. People should show their hands, not reach for anything or make sudden or threatening moves.

Ormani Muckle, age 17, attended the meeting with Roberson. "It was good to hear the police position straight from them," he said.

## Many Questions For Police

Audience members asked: How they could tell if they were being profiled? What is a threatening movement? Could they videotape police if they were stopped? Should they tell the police if they have a weapon?

They also wanted to know what the police learned from Brown's death in Ferguson.

The officers answered carefully. Yes, you can videotape the police, they said. No, police are not allowed to profile citizens. A "threatening motion" is any sudden move, especially in the dark. Yes, you should tell police you have a weapon.

As for the Ferguson question, policeman Henry King responded. He said it is important to hold community meetings and discuss possible problems before they happen.

## Police Can Defend Themselves

Someone asked whether police could draw a weapon on an unarmed person. King said officers may shoot if threatened by someone who is bigger and stronger. An officer can also shoot someone who tries to take the officer's gun away.

Audience members, most of them black, nodded, and no one seemed to disagree.

At end the program, Chief Moore looked out at the crowd. He slowly said, "The police are the public, and the public are the police."
