BOGOTA, Colombia â€” Andres Del Castillo practices bullfighting moves with his teacher in a parking garage. The garage is across the highway from Bogota's El Campin soccer stadium.

Del Castillo, 18, sweeps a magenta cape. His chest is thrust forward, his lips are puckered and his mouth bulges. He ends the pass with one leg fully extended behind him. The other leg is firmly planted below. After the imaginary bull passes, Del Castillo lifts his eyes and takes a few triumphant strides.

His teacher for the past six weeks has been Gonzalo Rincon. He is the father of legendary Colombian bullfighter Cesar Rincon.

In Colombia, most teenagers play Xbox or soccer. They chase girls, not bulls. Bullfighting used to be a big part of yearly celebrations. Today, the Spanish colonial tradition is disappearing. Things are changing and bullfighting faces sometimes violent protests. The sport does not do well as a business, either.

## Fewer Places Host Bullfights

The 77-year-old Rincon's goal is to change the art of bullfighting. He wants to add new expressions and movements that have never been tried before. His son did the same thing when he thrilled audiences worldwide.

The soft-spoken Del Castillo dropped out of high school at 17. He said training to be a bullfighter has made him more disciplined. But he has made big sacrifices. His father refused to talk to him for six months. He works odd jobs to pay his rent.

"I think this is the lowest moment in the tradition," Cesar Rincon said. He is a bull rancher in retirement who lives in Madrid with his father. He spends four months of the year in Colombia. About a dozen bull ranches across the country have gone out of business in the last 10 years as fewer places host fights.

Ticket prices are too high for most Colombians. A lower-level seat in Medellin costs an entire month's salary for a low-paid worker. Benjamin de Los Rios runs Medellin's Plaza de la Macarena. He says international bullfighters that draw crowds get paid up to $140,000 per afternoon. The result is a half-empty arena and fewer parents passing on the tradition to their children.

## Protest At La Macarena

About 30 college students protested before a recent bullfight at la Macarena. They were led by someone who only gave his name as Juan G. He was afraid of threats from bullfighting fans.

"We don't think that anyone has the right to torture anything, animals included," the New Jersey-born Colombian said. "It's a shift in generations. The country is changing and we want to do away with violence."

De Los Rios blames Walt Disney. He and others say that when cartoons began drawing animals with human-like looks and personalities, people began to treat them as humans. In Colombia, schools teach students about animal cruelty and saving the environment. Some teachers tell children that bullfighting is wrong.

Cesar Rincon says the beauty of bullfighting should be preserved.

"We have to teach our roots, the backbone of our tradition," he said.

In recent years, people who oppose bullfighting appeared to be winning. "Politicians have realized that they can win votes by saying they are against bullfighting," said Colombian bullfighter Manuel Libardo. He was voted Colombia's best bullfighter this year. He believes Colombia's bullfighting future is uncertain.

## Plaza De Toros Closed

Bogota's fancy Plaza de Toros de Santamaria has been closed for the past two years. The city's mayor gave his support to people who are against bullfighting.

Bullfighters, too, have had to get second jobs. Santiago Naranjo, a bullfighter since 2010, has a store at a Bogota shopping center. He also studies business.

In 2011 in Ecuador's capital, Quito, voters decided to stop the killing of animals for sport in the city. In a traditional bullfight, the bull is killed. Milton Calahorrano is president of Ecuador's bullfighting union. He said the bullfighting business was greatly harmed by the change. Still, the Plaza was at least three-quarters filled over the following two years.

Last year, the group decided it would not hold bullfights in Quito until the law is changed and the tradition is restored. A bullring was set up outside the city limits. The group is looking forward to a change this year.
