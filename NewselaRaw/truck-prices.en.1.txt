DETROIT — Raising prices may sound like a strange way to boost truck sales. But General Motors is doing exactly that to try to win in the red-hot U.S. pickup market.

The automaker is adding almost $2,100 to the suggested price of the basic, no-frills version of its 2014 Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck. That's 8.5 percent higher than when the truck hit car dealer showrooms in the spring. Upgraded versions of the Silverado, as well as the GMC Sierra pickup truck, will see similar percentage increases.

Industry analysts suspect this new twist by GM is a marketing tactic to increase sales. They expect GM to raise incentives starting next month so dealers can advertise big discounts. Incentives are deals offered by car makers that lower the price a customer actually pays, usually on poor-selling models. A manufacturer, for instance, may offer $2,000 off a certain vehicle or a car loan at a very low interest rate.

## Incentives Make Customers Feel They're Getting A Deal

With incentives, customers will feel they're getting a deal. Whether they do or not depends on the size of the discount.

The move comes after GM's pickup truck sales fell 8 percent in September while its two biggest competitors saw increased sales. Sales of Ford's F-Series, the best-selling pickups in the United States, rose 10 percent and Chrysler's Ram posted an 8 percent increase. The Detroit Three — as GM, Ford and Chrysler are known — dominate U.S. full-size pickup truck sales with 90 percent of the market. The Toyota Tundra and Nissan Titan share the remaining 10 percent.

GM didn't offer the sweet deals Ford and Chrysler did last month, said Jesse Toprak, an analyst for the TrueCar.com auto pricing website. Raising prices and then adding incentives is common in the business. Truck buyers especially like to get deals, Toprak said.

GM's change in pricing strategy for trucks is intended mainly as a tactic for dealerships to be able to complete sales, he said. The increase covers trucks built after Oct. 7, so pickups now on dealer lots won't be affected.

GM officials may also be counting on a recent change in buying habits: Customers now pay less attention to the sticker price. The sticker price is the manufacturers' suggested price listed by law on a sticker pasted on a vehicle's window. Toprak says most buyers now research their cars and trucks online before buying. Many independent auto websites, which are unconnected to car dealers or manufacturers, suggest prices that are below the sticker price, he said.

"Savvy customers know how to look beyond this and go to net pricing," he said.

In May, Nissan Motor Co. took the opposite approach. The Japanese automaker cut prices and incentives so its cars showed up high in Internet searches performed by buyers looking for cheaper cars. Nissan sales are up 13 percent since then.

## The Future Pricing Of GM Trucks

GM spokesman Jim Cain wouldn't comment on whether the company would increase discounts when its current round of incentives expires Oct. 31. But he said that incentives do give dealers flexibility to promote sales. They allow customers without a lot of available cash to use rebates as down payments. A rebate is money given by the manufacturer to a customer who buys a car. Customers who buy cars on credit must put a certain amount of money down and then pay the rest off over time.

"That does help customers purchase a vehicle from time to time if they've got no money down," said Tom Kool. He runs a small Chevrolet dealership in Sturgis, Mich., just north of the Indiana border.

Last month, GM spent nearly 20 percent less on pickup discounts than a year earlier. The discounts averaged $3,430 less on the Silverado and $3,339 less on the Sierra, according to TrueCar. Ford spent about $100 more discounting the F-150, which is an older truck with a lower base price. Chrysler spent nearly $700 more than GM. Both Chrysler and Ford offered bigger discounts on 2013 models last month, while GM essentially sold out of 2012 models during the summer.

Under the increases, the base sticker price on the Silverado will rise from $24,585 to $26,670, including shipping, according to GM's website. A basic crew cab, which has the most interior space, will go from $33,195 to $35,095.

When the trucks were introduced, GM kept sticker prices the same as on 2013 models, Cain said. The increase has been planned for a long time, he said.

The increases raise the Silverado's sticker price to $1,780 more than Chrysler's Ram pickup truck and $1,605 above Ford's F-150. Cain says GM can charge higher prices because it has the newest truck in the market with more features, including increased gas mileage.
