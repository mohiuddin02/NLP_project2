QUINHAGAK, Alaska — Archaeologists from around the world are unearthing remnants of an ancient Yup'ik village, frozen in place for hundreds of years on the Bering Sea coast of far Western Alaska. As the coastline erodes, ancient artifacts have become visible.

Archaeologists involved say it is the biggest excavation of Yup'ik artifacts from before the arrival of Russians and other Europeans in the early 1800s. In a region where tradition says old treasures should remain undisturbed, the Yup'ik people of Quinhagak invited the archaeologists in.

Why? "Because we had nothing," said Warren Jones, president of the village corporation, Qanirtuuq Inc., which owns the dig site land. Cultural elements, including language and traditional dance, were stifled by the Moravian missionaries and nearly lost, Jones said.

Growing up, "all I heard about was the church stuff, not what our ancestors did," he said. They had stories of their culture, but no ancient harpoons, stone ulus (curved knives) or little figurines of mythical creatures.

## Sod Houses Reveal History

In a project that began five years ago, scholars, students and Quinhagak residents are working together to carefully take apart, document and save relics from a sod house site they call "Nunalleq," or old village.

"This is the first excavation of a Yup'ik house," said lead archaeologist Rick Knecht.

Carbon dating of grasses and berry seeds at the site provides evidence that people first lived there in the 1300s, Knecht said. Then the village was attacked and set ablaze around 1640 by a neighboring settlement during the region's "Bow and Arrow Wars," he said. On the other side of the continent, the Pilgrims had just arrived in New England. But here, people were killed and the site was abandoned.

The old sod houses are on the Bering Sea coast a few miles across the tundra from Quinhagak. They collapsed in the fire and over time the site was hidden in the tall grasses.

At the center, archaeologists say they found a traditional large men's winter house. Smaller rooms connected by covered wooden walkways were added over the years, maybe as a way to bring in and protect women and children during the village wars, the researchers say. Traditionally, women and children lived separately from the men.

## Global Warming Is Hitting Hard

Until the permafrost began melting and the edge of the tundra eroded into the sea, the old village site, down to wooden cooking spoons, was well-preserved in the hard-frozen earth.

"There are all sorts of ghastly consequences to global warming but the one we're worried about is the loss of cultural heritage," Knecht said. "Because people live on these coastlines and the archaeological record is here."

Just in the past five years, 30 feet at the edge of the dig site has been lost.

"It's really going fast, right in front of our eyes," Knecht said. Had the work not started when it did in 2009, thousands of artifacts at the site would have washed away.

## The Smallest Items Tell Stories

Quinhagak likely was one of dozens of settlements in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta at the time, and may have been large, said Ann Fienup-Riordan, an anthropologist who has worked with Yup'ik people for 40 years.

The diggers have collected close to 50,000 items, counting ancient animal bones, bits of grass mats that covered the walls, and fragments of wooden tools. Of those, as many as 5,000 are special enough to display in a museum, Knecht said. Jones' favorite: a mask with a dual wolf-human face, a symbol of transformation.

Fienup-Riordan, the anthropologist, collected impressions and stories from Quinhagak elders about the objects found. Dig team members brought dolls, hunting tools, woven pieces and more to elders, who talked in Yup'ik about the finds. One elder, George Pleasant, was able to identity the source of the stone for an ulu blade by its color. He described some wooden pieces not as handles, as the archaeologists had guessed, but as weights for fishing nets.

"I think it's the best thing anybody came and helped us do," elder Annie Cleveland said of the dig.

The artifacts confirm and add detail to the stories of the village, Knecht said. Fienup-Riordan now has a date for when the village was burned down.

"We only get one shot at it," Knecht said. "These are all pages in the Yup'ik history book."

## Learning From The Old Ways

Village leaders work with elders and the scientists in decision-making: when to dig, how to preserve the site, what to do with the finds.

Recently, the archaeologists put some of the most interesting recovered objects on display in the big red community building and invited the whole village to see — and touch — them. A tiny seal amulet made of mammoth ivory. Wooden masks that had been broken in half. Stone harpoon tips. Pieces of model kayaks that show the history of the design.

At a table with tiny pieces of carved ivory jewelry, John Smith, a village master carver, marveled at the skill of his ancestors before they had electric tools and metal blades. It inspired him to recreate some of the more intricate designs. Maybe the dig project will draw village kids away from their video games and cellphones, he said.

Both the archaeologists and residents of Quinhagak say they want to create a village cultural center to display some of the ancient tools and art, and provide a place for artists and craftsmen to work and teach others.

Quinhagak may just be the start, Knecht said. Other ancient Alaska village sites along the coast and on rivers are eroding too.

Their stories have yet to be uncovered.
