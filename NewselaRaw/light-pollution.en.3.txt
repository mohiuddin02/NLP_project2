SEATTLE — These days, most people never think to look up at the stars. And if they do look, chances are they won't see much. Most nights, the skies just aren't dark enough anymore.

Sixty-two-year-old Dave Ingram heads a group trying to bring back dark skies. The sad truth, he says, is that there isn't much real night sky left. And that means people alive today will be the first in history to go through life failing to grasp their place in the universe. Because they simply have never seen the universe.

"You can put anybody — I don't care who they are — out under the stars for 30 minutes, and they start asking the big questions," Ingram says.

But it's more complicated than that. Even the small handful of people who do look up at the stars find that a truly dark sky hardly exists any more. What passes for dark these days is a sort of greenish-gray glow, far from the ink-black sky of our ancestors.

## A Disappearing Darkness

In the old world, you walked beneath the stars nightly because you had to. They became your compass, your friends, even your gods. In the new one, you don't because, well, you don't. Humans have been walking under the stars for about 2.3 million years. Only in the past 135 have most of us lost our connection with what shines above.

Ever since the invention of the light bulb in 1879, darkness has been disappearing. Today, all of Europe and most of the United States east of the Mississippi River never falls into true darkness.

The western U.S. is quickly becoming the same. Only in the desert Southwest are there still small pockets of the deepest black. Today, 99 percent of Americans rarely ever see a true dark sky.

Light pollution, some scientists argue, has become a real problem.

It has changed how trees grow and has caused the mass deaths of birds. Bird used to know where to fly by looking at the stars. Now, birds are tricked into flying into brightly lit buildings. Up to a billion a year die in the U.S. alone.

And the lack of true darkness seems to cause problems for humans too. It may lead to deep sadness and disease, including cancer.

## Our Place In The Universe

But there is also a growing fear that it is making us lose something important: A deep understanding of our place in the universe. And thus a deep understanding of ourselves.

It's a question that writer Paul Bogard thinks about daily.

When we come face-to-face with the universe, he says, we realize that our "problems are just not that big." But "it's pretty easy, if you never see the universe, to think this world is all there is."

He added, "If you really see the night sky," you can't help but feel "awe and wonder and gratitude and spirituality."

It's a problem for us today. But, he thinks, it's perhaps a greater one for tomorrow. Throughout history, a fascination with the universe inspired art, science, and religion.

"And now," he says, "it's just gone."

## A Love Of Bright Lights

Fortunately, light pollution is not hard to get rid of. Except for one thing, that is: modern human nature.

In society today, light means progress and symbolizes man's victory over nature. Along with that goes a strong belief that bright light means safety.

Ingram and other members of the International Dark-Sky Association keep those feelings in mind. They argue that light pollution can be contained and even reversed. And it can be done without losing any useful light.

"Nobody wants to go back to gas lamps," Ingram says.

There is a simple answer: "full cutoff" lights. These prevent rays from going into the sky where they cause that green glow we're all beginning to accept as darkness.

Most lighting isn't designed to prevent light from going into the sky. Among the worst offenders are the sort of glaring lights found in parking lots, backyards and gas stations. Even some streetlights are a problem. Such lights could easily be changed.

"The technology exists to have a lot more control over our lights," Bogard says.
