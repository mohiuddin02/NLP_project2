LOS ANGELES, Calif. — Not that long ago, Elizabeth Castro had never tasted beets or kumquats. Now she does not just eat them, she  grows them.

Castro is 15 years old. She is part of a gardening program at her school in Los Angeles. At John C. Fremont High School, she grows fruits and vegetables of all kinds. It is not where you would expect to find a garden. It is in the middle of the city, near places like auto shops and fast food restaurants. 

The garden was started four years ago. Now there are plans to add a greenhouse. Then the students can grow food when it is cold outside.

## New Foods Also Go Home

"Many things that I experienced here, I had never experienced before," Castro told Dr. Vivek Murthy. He is a doctor. He works for the U.S. government to oversee the health of Americans. He visited the garden to support the gardening program.

"Instead of going home and doing nothing at all, we come here," Castro said. She does not just try new foods herself. She also brings home things from the garden for her family to taste.

Growing fruits and vegetables makes people want to eat more of them. Studies show that when people eat more fruits and vegetables, they are healthier and less likely to be overweight.  

"These kinds of programs, they help build a demand for healthy foods," Murthy said.

## Many Of The School's Students Are Overweight

The program takes place after school for 12 weeks. Students learn to grow things like limes, potatoes and beets. They also learn to cook healthy dishes using the foods that they grow themselves.

The students have not just seen improvement in how they eat.  Their grades have also improved. 

A 2013 report showed almost half of the school's students are overweight. That is higher than the national average. Across the country, almost one-fifth of children ages 2 to 19 are obese. People that are obese are very overweight. It can cause serious health problems. Experts hope the program will help.

## A Good Way To Use Extra Space

Azucena Lozoya, age 16, is also a student at the school. She signed up for the gardening program because she has never tried anything like it before. Since then, she has enjoyed tasting things like kale. 

"My mom never makes stuff like that," Lozoya said.

Many schools have outdoor space that they are not using.  Garden programs like this one are a way to use that space.
