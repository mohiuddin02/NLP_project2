Long before the dinosaurs, a giant sea creature was one of the largest living beings on Earth.

Paleontologists are calling the newly discovered animal Aegirocassis benmoulae. It grew up to 7 feet long and devoured plankton like a whale.

An early member of the arthropod family — animals with external skeletons — it was an ancient ancestor of cockroaches, butterflies and lobsters, and lived about 480 million years ago in a shallow sea that once covered part of the Sahara Desert in Morocco.

Scientists say the discovery of the new creature provided an important clue to how arthropods evolved, or changed as a group over long periods of time.

"It is one of the biggest arthropods that ever existed, far bigger than any arthropod today," said Peter Van Roy. He is a paleobiologist at Yale University who helped uncover some of the specimens of the extinct animal. Paleontologists and paleobiologists study fossils of ancient creatures to see how they evolved.

A paper describing the early arthropod was published Wednesday in the scientific magazine Nature.

## Giants Of The Cambrian

Aegirocassis benmoulae is part of a group of animals known as anomalocaridid. Now extinct, they were the largest animals of the Cambrian time period, about 543 million to 490 million years ago. Aegirocassis benmoulae is the latest of these animals to be found and more than double the size of the biggest of its older relatives.

It was alive during the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event, about 480 million years ago when many new species came into being.

The anomalocaridids were flat-bodied water dwellers. All of them had two growths in the front of their mouths. These structures were mostly used to grasp prey like worms and mollusks. However, the growths on the newly discovered sea creature were shaped differently. They formed an elaborate net of spikes that helped the creature catch plankton in the water.

Despite its large size, Aegirocassis benmoulae appears to have been fairly common, Van Roy said. He and Mohamed Ben Moula, the Moroccan fossil collector who originally found it, have discovered dozens of fossils of the sea creature in the Moroccan desert.

Van Roy said the huge sea creatures may have come together to molt — shed their shells as they grew — or may have lived together in a group. "It is interesting we found so many of them. It shows there was a well developed, rich plankton system in place 480 million years ago."

## "These Extraordinary Fossils"

Arthropods first showed up about 530 million years ago. Today the category has the largest number of different animals on the planet.

However, early fossils of arthropods are hard to come by, which made this particular find so exciting.

Most fossils are the remains of the hard parts of animal, like shells and bone. This is because soft tissues like skin and muscles decay so rapidly after death, explained John Paterson. He is a professor at the University of New England in Australia and was not involved in the study.

"However, these extraordinary fossils are soft-bodied, which are typically very rare," he said.

Van Roy described how giant storms occasionally caused large mud flows to wash into the ancient sea. The mud smothered everything at the bottom, including the giant sea creatures. The mud provided the right conditions, including a lack of oxygen, to turn the creatures' soft tissues to stone.

"Sites like this are extremely rare," he said.

## Solving A Mystery

The fossils were so well preserved scientists were able to solve a long-standing evolutionary mystery.

The bodies and legs of arthropods are made of multiple parts. These can be used for a variety of purposes and allows them to live in many different kinds of environments.

Today, the legs of most arthropods have two parts, but researchers were not sure how they developed that way.

Paleontologists thought they could trace the leg of the modern arthropod to a much earlier arthropod from the early Cambrian period. This ancient animal had a set of flaps that ran down the top side of its body for swimming, like an upper limb. It also had a set of legs on its belly side, for walking.

And yet, earlier studies of anomalocaridids, the group the newly discovered sea creature belonged to, found just one set of flaps on the lower side of the body. This led researchers to wonder where the upper limb had gone.

## Missing Flaps Found

The new fossils described in the Nature paper suggest that the second limb did not go anywhere. These fossils were particularly complete, so paleontologists were able to see that anomalocaridids actually did have a second set of swimming flaps.

These flaps were the ancestors of the type of legs seen in more modern arthropods, Paterson said.

Van Roy said there were still many more fossils to study from the Moroccan site.

"We have something like 5,000 or 6,000 specimens, most of them unstudied," he said.

They also found more advanced arthropods. These include types of horseshoe crabs. Some of them look remarkably like modern-day horseshoe crabs. There are also jellyfish relatives, and early starfish and snails.
