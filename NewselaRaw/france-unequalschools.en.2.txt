PARIS — France has one of the developed world's most unequal school system, a new study found. How students do in school depends greatly on how wealthy their families are.

To make its educational system more fair, France announced a new plan. It will cut back a language program for top students. It will also give schools more say in how students spend their time.

The lack of equality in education threatens the country's future, the French government says.

The changes set to start in 2016 are not major. In France, students take Latin and ancient Greek. The government will reduce the amount of time students learn them and increase the classroom time devoted to modern foreign languages. It will also let schools — rather than the government — decide how to spend one-fifth of students' time.

## Teachers Unions Criticize Plan

But the plan has drawn criticism from the unions that represent teachers and also from French conservatives who do not want the educational system to change. On Tuesday, teachers across France went on strike. They marched in the streets instead of teaching school. The debate is similar to discussions about low-income American students who do not do well in school.

French teachers unions complained the plan does not deal with the real problem. They also say it was pushed through without checking with them. Conservatives fear an attack on France's traditional education, which includes ancient languages. They also worry that the country's high educational standards will go down.

Other chances include adding classes that cover several subjects at once. The government also wants to cut a program in which students learn in two languages at the same time. Only about 15 percent of top students enroll in that program. In exchange, schools will teach foreign language classes to more children at a younger age.

## It Won't Just Be Greek And Latin To Them

Students will start learning their first foreign language — usually English — in about first grade. They will begin their second foreign language around age 12.

Students won't spend as much time on Latin and Greek. Currently 20 percent of middle schoolers learn those ancient languages.

The number of hours students spend in school, 26 per week, will not change.

Peter Gumbel is a British journalist who lives in Paris. He is about to publish a second book about French schools. He called the plan a timid approach to an urgent problem.

He said the government cannot make extreme changes. It knows that if the changes are too drastic, the entire country will be angry. As it is, the French government is pushing the limits of what people feel comfortable with, he said.

## Study Shows Achievement Gaps Between Rich And Poor

The unions claimed more than half the teachers in France took part in the strike. The government said fewer than one in four middle school teachers participated.

In a letter, opponents said the changes will not make a difference in children's education.

France's government is under pressure to fix the system. The 2012 study from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) showed large differences between rich and poor children, especially in math. Among all the 39 countries that participated in the study, only Taipei, the capital of Taiwan, showed a bigger difference in math between rich and poor students.

"How can we accept that our educational system can't promote all talents, that so many middle schoolers do not master basics, do not master foreign languages?" Prime Minister Manuel Valls wrote in a French newspaper.

In the modern world, this is a big problem for France and its children, he said.

France's last education reform added a half-day to the four-day school week in elementary schools. That move set off protests for a year. The education minister at the time quit after pushing the reform through.

## Critic: Changes Will Only Be Cosmetic

The latest education minister, Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, has staked her job on the latest changes. She said the critics are full of lies and nonsense.

Gumbel said the changes will do little to address the basic problems in French education.

The plan makes school more interesting, more about what they need to know in the real world and more fun, he said. "And that of course is shocking to the French purists who want you to be cramming things that are useless for your life."

He said people think French schools are marvelous places where the students are rewarded for hard work and where great things are learned. The reality is that one out of five kids "are not learning anything at all," he said.
