JERUSALEM â€” The long-running conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians has spread to another venue: FIFA, the world soccer association. FIFA President Sepp Blatter went to Israel last week and met with Israeli and Palestinian leaders, trying to broker a compromise.

This week at the FIFA congress in Zurich, Switzerland, the 209 member countries will vote on a resolution put forward by the Palestinian Football Association. The resolution, which needs two-thirds of the vote to pass, would suspend Israel from FIFA.

In recent years, the Palestinians have been pushing against Israel in what has been called a "diplomatic intifada." The Arabic word "intifada" is roughly translated as "uprising" or "rebellion."

The Palestinians are trying to isolate and embarrass Israel internationally. They hope this will build support for their cause and put pressure on the Israeli government.

## "I Am Here To Construct Bridges"

U.S.-led peace talks between the Israelis and Palestinians broke down a year ago, and they seem unlikely to restart anytime soon.

The Palestinian-Israeli conflict goes back to 1947. After World War II, the state of Israel was created, giving Jews a homeland in the Middle East. The creation of Israel was disputed: Palestinians claimed the land belonged to them. Wars were fought and years of conflict followed. Today, many Palestinians live in two areas partly controlled by Israel: the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

In the FIFA complaint, the Palestinians said that their soccer teams have been prevented from playing due to Israeli restrictions on their movement and military action in the West Bank. They also said that the Israeli Football Association has not done enough to fight anti-Arab racism inside Israeli soccer stadiums. The Palestinians also said that there are five Israeli teams from settlements in the West Bank. Many countries view these settlements as illegal.

Blatter met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday. The FIFA president told reporters in Jerusalem that he hoped to find a compromise before this week's vote at the FIFA congress.

"One thing I can say is that football is more than a game. It has the power to connect people and construct bridges," Blatter said. "I am here to construct bridges and make sure football is not dividing but is uniting." Soccer is called football in many parts of the world.

## Talking To Both Sides

Blatter did not give details about his meeting with Netanyahu. He did say he would pass along a message from the Israeli prime minister to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, whom he was to meet in Ramallah in the West Bank on Wednesday.

On Tuesday, Palestinian Football Association chief Jibril Rajoub said he had no plans to back down from the resolution. Rajoub said he believed there were enough votes from FIFA members to pass the resolution.

"The Israeli Football Association has tried to cover its ugly face with plastic surgery for its government," he said.

Rajoub noted that FIFA has suspended countries before. South Africa was suspended, and later expelled, for three decades, because of its apartheid policies that discriminated against blacks. Yugoslavia was suspended in the early 1990s because of U.N. sanctions against trade with Yugoslavia that were put in place because of the Yugoslav wars.

"Blatter is optimistic there will be a solution, but the ball is in Netanyahu's court. He is the one that calls the shots," Rajoub said.

## "Tries To Stay Away From Politics"

Rotem Kemer, chief executive of the Israel Football Association, said that the Palestinians were blaming the football association for actions taken by the Israeli government.

Kemer said the Palestinians were mixing politics and soccer. He argued that his association has taken steps to support Palestinian soccer and fight racism. But security restrictions by the Israeli authorities were out of the association's control, he said.

"There are many conflicts around the world: Ukraine and Russia, Iraq, Syria, in Africa. Do we want every association to use its FIFA status to go against other federations?" he asked. "I am not sure FIFA really wants this. It is a sports organization that tries to stay away from politics."
