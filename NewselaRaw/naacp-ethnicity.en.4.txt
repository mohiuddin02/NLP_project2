SEATTLE, Wash. â€” Rachel Dolezal was an activist who lived in Spokane, Washington. She is now in trouble.

Dolezal was a leader in a group that works to support black Americans. The group is the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, or NAACP. They work to make sure everyone is treated fairly, no matter the color of their skin.

Dolezal was the head of the Spokane NAACP. People in Spokane thought she was an African-American woman. Last week, the truth came out. People discovered that she was actually a white woman. She was pretending to be black. On Monday, she quit her job.

Dolezal's story has got a lot of people talking about some difficult problems.

There has been more and more diversity in America. More people are saying they are part of two or more racial groups, like white and black. People are asking what it means to say they belong to a certain race. They are also asking whether it is OK for people to choose a different race from the one they were born into.

There will continue to be a lot of questions. Some things are for certain. The story of Rachel Dolezal has created both anger and concern across the country.

## She Has Not Said She Is Sorry For Lying

Dolezal wrote a post online after she quit. She wrote about the future problems for African-Americans. She did not mention she lied. She did not say she was sorry.

Baz Dreisinger is the author of a book about race. Many people are willing to think openly about race, she said. Still, many people are stuck thinking that "black is black and white is white."

Dolezal has been praised for making the 106-year-old NAACP chapter in Spokane more active. She was known for helping African-Americans in her community.

Other things in her life have been troubling. She used to be a student at Howard University. The college is known for enrolling many African-American students. When she was a student, Dolezal sued the school.

Dolezal said she was treated unfairly because she was white. She said that the university removed her artwork from a presentation. Dolezal said that it favored African-American students' art over hers.

The court closed the issue. It didn't think Dolezal's complaint was serious.

## Her Parents Adopted Four Black Children

Dolezal's mother and father have adopted three African-American children and one Haitian child. They say she has pretended to be black for many years now.

"We hope that Rachel will get the help she needs," her mother said on a news show.

"We weren't going to lie. We told the truth. Rachel is our birth daughter," her father said.

Cornell William Brooks is the national president of the NAACP. Dolezal was well-liked in Spokane, he said. There is "a great deal of disappointment and pain now."

Brooks also said you do not need to be black to join the NAACP.

What is important is telling the truth, he said.

Ed Prince is in charge of another Washington group that supports black Americans. He said what Dolezal did was not fair. He said black people cannot choose to be white.

"An African-American can never wake up and say, 'I'm gonna make my hair blond, put on white makeup and go through my day as a white person,'" Prince said.
