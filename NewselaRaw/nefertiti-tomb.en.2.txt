The ancient Egyptian Queen Nefertiti has long been at the center of a mystery.

For years, archaeologists have wondered where her tomb might be hidden. Nefertiti belonged to the family line of the famous King Tutankhamun, better known as King Tut. Indeed, some believe she was Tut's mother. While the other royals in her line are all accounted for, Nefertiti is still missing.

## Secret Doors In A King's Tomb

Now, however, an archaeologist named Nicholas Reeves claims he has found her secret tomb. He says it is in the Valley of the Kings, hidden just beyond a wall near the resting place of Tut.

Reeves' theory is based on a detailed study of the walls of Tutankhamun's tomb. Using radar scans, Reeves was able to see what the walls looked like beneath their layers of paint. He found a number of cracks that he believes may indicate two previously concealed doors.

One of these doors could possibly lead to a storeroom, Reeves said. However, the larger door on the north side of the tomb could lead to another room holding the remains of Nefertiti.

## Could Be "The Biggest" Discovery

"I have been testing the evidence ever since, looking for indications that what I thought I was seeing was, in fact, not there," Reeves said. "But the more I looked, the more information I found that I seemed to be looking at something pretty real."

More tests will be needed to show whether Reeves is right.

"If I'm wrong, I'm wrong," Reeves said. "But if I'm right this is potentially the biggest archaeological discovery ever made."

The tomb of Tutankhamun was first discovered by archaeologist Howard Carter in 1922. It consists of four rooms, but it is much smaller than those of other pharaohs.

## Priceless Treasures, Hidden Away

When Carter first found it, Tut's tomb was filled with thousands of priceless treasures. It had remained safe from tomb robbers because of how well it was hidden.

To find Nefertiti would be a huge win for archaeologists. The queen, famed for her beauty, served as co-ruler with King Akhenaten, her husband. She may also have been a pharaoh on her own after his death. Most likely her tomb would be filled with as many treasures as Tutankhamun's â€” perhaps even more.

Tutankhamun is believed to have ruled for only nine years, after taking power as a young boy. His remains show that he was a frail child. He had a deformed foot and could walk only with a cane.

## Gold Mask And Legends

King Tut was not as forceful a ruler as some of the pharaohs who came before him, including Ramses II, Khufu and his father, Akhenaten. Still, the magnificence of his tomb's treasures made the tomb one of the most celebrated archaeological finds in the world. His gold funeral mask is one of the most famous ancient artifacts ever discovered.

Tut's tomb has captured the public's imagination not just because of its treasures. It reflects the beliefs of an ancient and mysterious religion that has intrigued many.

Ancient Egyptians believed in an afterlife, so the dead were carefully prepared for their life after death. Bodies were preserved through mummification. Riches and other belongings were buried with the dead so they could be used in the afterlife, and families were expected to bring food to the tombs.

## Priestess In A Past Life?

Some believe there is a "Pharaoh's Curse," which brings bad luck to those who disturb the tombs. Indeed, 12 members of the team that opened King Tut's tomb died within seven years.

There is also the strange story of Englishwoman Dorothy Louise Eady. Better known as Omm Sety, Eady believed she had been an ancient Egyptian priestess in a past life.

Eady grew up dreaming about her experiences in ancient Egypt. She eventually moved to Egypt, where she worked with a number of well-known archaeologists. She made a number of archaeological discoveries based on what she said were memories, not research.

At one point, Eady said she knew where the tomb of Nefertiti was located. She claimed she knew based on a conversation in another life with a pharaoh.

"It's in the Valley of the Kings, and it's quite near to the Tutankhamun tomb," she said. "But it's in a place where nobody would ever think of looking for it."

It may just turn out that Eady was right all along.
