Named Siats meekerorum, it was an important dinosaur before the days of Tyrannosaurus rex. For a time, it ruled North America.

Most likely, Siats was a close cousin to certain dinosaurs found on other continents.

The 4-ton, 30-foot animal was discovered by scientists from the Field Museum in Chicago. The bones were found in a region of 100-million-year-old rock in Utah. Peter Makovicky and Lindsay Zanno led the expedition.

The discovery of Siats meekerorum is important. Previously, very little was known about North American wildlife in the tens of millions of years before T. rex entered the scene.

## Top Of The Food Chain

Although it wasn't as big as T. rex, Siats is the third-largest carnivore found on the continent. It was named after two things: a man-eating monster from the legends of the local Ute Indians, and the Meeker family, who are big supporters of the museum.

In 2008, Zanno spotted the first of the bones on a hillside in Utah's Cedar Mountain Formation. This happened just as the group was getting ready to call it quits.

This Friday, Zanno and Makovicky will officially unveil the new species.

"It's more than just a new dinosaur," Makovicky explained. "It's the first evidence we have of a whole new group of dinosaurs in North America. And it challenges a view that was common maybe a decade or so ago."

Back then, he said that people thought, "'OK, you know, North America, rising sea levels, the species seem to be very unique to North America and only remotely related to (those on) other continents.' That's slowly being challenged. This is another piece of evidence saying, 'No, dinosaurs were actually distributing themselves pretty widely across the continents.'"

## Siats Related To Giganotosaurus

Because of its size, Zanno and Makovicky say, Siats is on top of a food chain that included T. rex's smaller ancestors. Remains of such T. rex ancestors were also recently discovered in Utah. The fully developed T. rex later ruled North America, until dinosaurs became extinct 65 million years ago.

Siats, though, isn't related to the T. rex. Instead, it's part of the allosauroid family of dinosaurs. Its best-known relative might be the Giganotosaurus, found in South America.

Zanno recalled her discovery of the first bone.

"We had spent a week prospecting other rocks and had found nothing," she said. "I was walking across this low badland and stumbled across this sort of black bone. I looked down and saw immediately it was a type of bone from a predatory dinosaur."

The expedition team of about nine people spent the rest of their time digging around the hipbone that she'd found. The scientists began to wonder if maybe they had a big herbivore, or plant-eater, instead.

## Two Other Dinosaurs Discovered

But return visits for more extensive excavation in 2009 and 2010 confirmed Zanno's original hunch that they were dealing with a predator. More bones were turned up, including vertebrae from the backbone.

From there it was a matter of bringing what they found back to the lab. Many of the bones had to be carefully separated from the rock they were stuck in. After five years of careful preparation and study, including visits to similar fossil remains in London and Argentina, the Siats bones were finally ready for their unveiling.

Most of the bones found are from one animal. But there is also a toe bone and a couple of tailbones from a second Siats.

Makovicky said he and Zanno have discovered two more dinosaur species from the same site. Sometime soon they will be ready for their own debut.
