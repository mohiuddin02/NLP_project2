The barefoot man in mismatched plaid clothing roamed for years through Princeton University's math building. In empty classrooms, the "Phantom of Fine Hall," as he was known, muttered to himself and scribbled mysterious equations on the blackboards.

He was a solitary figure, suffering from schizophrenia and paranoid thoughts. He once declined a job offer from the University of Chicago, saying he was about to be named Emperor of Antarctica.

Yet John Forbes Nash Jr. was also a genius and a Nobel Prize winner who transformed the field of economics, the study of how money and wealth are produced and used. He was also known as one of the greatest mathematicians of his time.

The inspiration for the 2001 Oscar-winning film "A Beautiful Mind," Nash eventually recovered from his devastating illness.

## "The Nash Equilibrium"

Nash, 86, and his wife, Alicia, 82, died Saturday in a traffic accident on the New Jersey Turnpike. The taxi in which they were passengers hit a guardrail, a spokesman for the New Jersey State Police said. Nash and his wife were on their way home to Princeton after a trip to Norway, where he won a mathematics prize.

Although Nash was famous among mathematicians for sophisticated solutions to a variety of problems, he was more widely known for his work in economics.

He won the 1994 Nobel Prize in economics for his contributions to game theory, the mathematical study of strategic decision-making. His work has been critical to high-stakes contests such as nuclear weapons talks, trade negotiations and elections.

His paper, completed at age 21, on game theory was only 27 pages long, but the implications of what came to be called "the Nash equilibrium" were huge.

Game theory had emerged in the 1940s as the creation of mathematician John von Neumann and economist Oskar Morgenstern. The two were interested in "zero-sum" games — the kind with a winner who takes all and a loser who gets nothing.

With mathematical elegance, Nash analyzed complex rivalries and found ways to compute a sweet spot — the Nash equilibrium. It allowed each side in an argument to get the best deal possible under the circumstances. Workers unions and company management would apply it in complicated contract talks and nuclear superpowers would use it to keep world peace.

"Nash's insight into the dynamics of human rivalry — his theory of rational conflict and cooperation — was to become one of the most influential ideas of the 20th century,"  biographer Sylvia Nasar wrote. The movie about Nash was based on her 1999 biography, "A Beautiful Mind." He transformed economics, Nasar wrote.

## A Brilliant Mathematician

He was born June 13, 1928, in Bluefield, West Virginia, the son of an engineer and a former teacher. When Nash was in fourth grade, his parents were told their son had no ability in math. He would always get the right answers, but approached the problems in off-the-wall ways that weren't in the textbook.

Nash graduated from the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in three years with bachelor's and master's degrees in mathematics. He also received a one-line recommendation that eased his way into Princeton, which had one of the world's best doctorate programs in math. The recommendation said only, "This man is a genius."

At Princeton, Nash seldom attended class, annoyed other students by always whistling classical music and spent hours bicycling figure-eights. He quickly developed a reputation for arrogance. After just a few weeks on campus, he managed to get an appointment with Princeton's most famous professor, Albert Einstein.

In Einstein's study, Nash explained some of his ideas on gravity, friction and radiation. After an hour, Einstein told him, "You had better study some more physics, young man."

At 22, he received his doctorate from Princeton, and began teaching at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

When Nash was 30, Fortune magazine singled him out as one of America's most brilliant mathematicians. In 1957, he married Alicia Larde, a physics student from El Salvador, and the two had a son in 1959.

## Battling Mental Illness

But by then, some of the personality quirks that were seen as signs of genius had turned self-destructive.

At one point, he pointed to a front-page story in The New York Times and told his stunned colleagues that extraterrestrials had placed coded messages for him in the newspaper article.

In 1959, he was suspended by MIT, spent time in a psychiatric hospital and wandered around Europe, trying to renounce his U.S. citizenship and become a citizen of the world.

Over the decades, there were additional hospitalizations, often followed by Nash's attempts to pursue his math research.

"When I had been long enough hospitalized, I would renounce my delusional hypotheses and revert to thinking of myself as a human of more conventional circumstances," he wrote.

Although Alicia divorced him in 1962, she cared for him over the years in her home. Former colleagues at Princeton, when they learned of Nash's illness, arranged for him to hold a job on campus.

## Winning The Nobel Prize

In the 1980s, Nash began to recover. He began to have intelligent conversations about math and some scholars began a campaign to recommend his work on game theory for the Nobel.

After being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1994, which he shared with three others for their work in game theory, Nash appeared to be a changed man.

"Recognition is a cure for many ills," said Harold Kuhn, a Princeton mathematician and friend of Nash.

"A Beautiful Mind," which starred Russell Crowe, did not follow the exact story of Nash's life, but was praised for its sensitive treatment of mental illness.

In March, Nash won the 2015 Abel Prize from the Norwegian Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Alicia and John Nash remarried in 2001. When they died Saturday, they were returning to their Princeton home from the Abel award presentation in Oslo.

Their son also is a mathematician suffering from schizophrenia. In recent years, John and Alicia met with New Jersey state officials to urge them to provide more money for mental health programs.
