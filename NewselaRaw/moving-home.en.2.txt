Today's young adults have been called the "Peter Pan" generation. Many of them live at home with their parents after college and don't seem to want to grow up.

But, they are not the spoiled brats we keep hearing about, says Jeffrey Jensen Arnett, executive director of the Society for the Study of Emerging Adulthood.

All signs indicate a generation doing it their own way. And it's not necessarily the wrong way.

A Pew Research Center report found 36 percent of adults ages 18 to 31 live in their parents' homes. This is the highest percentage in at least 40 years.

## "Wiser, More Careful Choices"

But a closer look at the numbers shows this actually may be reason to celebrate.

It is a cautious, financially responsible celebration, but still a celebration.

"They see it as evidence that this generation is making wiser, more careful choices," says science writer Robin Marantz Henig, co-author of "Twentysomething: Why Do Young Adults Seem Stuck?"

First, a look at the numbers. According to the U.S. Census, there are 21.6 million members of the millennial generation. A generation is all the people born about the same time, usually during a 20-year span. The millennial generation are generally born from 1982 to 2004, while the Z generation, for instance, are kids born after 2004.

Only 16 percent of 25- to 31-year-olds lived at home last year, compared with 56 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds, many of whom are in college. The census counts college students, even in their 20s, as living with their parents.

The idea that these kids are moving home to live off their parents "doesn't hold up," says Arnett.

In 1960, just 33 percent of young people attended college, and most of them were men, according to Arnett. Today, 70 percent of high school graduates enter college the next year. "All over the world, more young people are obtaining more education than ever before," he said.

## Jobs And Marriages

What they're not necessarily obtaining, however, are jobs. The Pew report found that 63 percent of 18- to 31-year-olds had jobs in 2012, compared with 70 percent in 2007. Forty-five percent of the millennials living at home were unemployed.

This is partly because of a slow economy, but it's also because millennials are hoping for interesting, fulfilling work, experts say.

They look for "purpose, meaning and self-growth in their careers," says Varda Konstam. She is a professor of counseling and school psychology at the University of Massachusetts at Boston and author of "Parenting Your Emerging Adult: Launching Kids From 18 to 29."

Arnett says young Americans change jobs an average of seven times from ages 20 to 29. That is much different than earlier generations who settled into stable careers shortly after graduating high school or college.

People think millennials are scared of commitment, but they are cautious about entering into bad marriages, Arnett said.

Indeed, fewer young adults are marrying. Just 25 percent of 18- to 31-year-olds were married in 2012, compared with 30 percent in 2007. And those who do marry are marrying later. The median age for marriage today is 27 for women and 29 for men, according to the Pew Research Center. In 1960, it was 20 for women and 22 for men.

"People used to marry young just to get out of the house," says Henig. "In a way, this generation is going back to the pattern of living at home until they're married. So this (increase) is hardly a sign of being lazy and aimless. It's just part of being in your 20s."

Living with parents can be a lifeline to young adults, and mean the difference between getting by and falling over the edge into poverty, Henig writes in "Twentysomething." In 2009, the U.S. Census Bureau discovered the poverty rate among 20- and 30-year-olds would have been much higher if they didn't live with their parents. The poverty rate would have been 42.8 percent, instead of 8.5 percent.

Also, most young adults get jobs and move out within six months to a year.

## Moving Out ASAP

"They almost all move home for economic reasons, and they almost always move out as soon as possible," says Arnett.

They want to live a full, independent life, as badly as their parents want them to, says Konstam.

"Emerging adults and their parents tend to have a very similar worldview," she says. "What their parents want for them is very frequently the same thing the kids want. They do want to be successful at work. They do want to commit to another person. They do want to own a house. But they tend to do it in their own way."

And a brief stay home is more likely to help, rather than hinder, those goals, she says.

Living at home gives young adults time to figure out what they want to do  in their careers and relationships.

"It's remarkably harmonious when emerging adults move home," Arnett said.

In 2013, a Clark University poll surveyed 1,006 parents of 18- to 29-year-olds.

Parents whose grown kids were at home were asked how it was going, Arnett says. "Sixty-one percent said it was mostly positive, 6 percent said mostly negative, and the rest were mixed."
