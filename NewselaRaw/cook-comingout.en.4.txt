Last week, Apple's leader Tim Cook made an announcement. He told the world that he is gay.

Many technology companies support gay rights in the United States. Cook's announcement may help them go further. They may soon work for gay rights in the rest of the world.

Cook's announcement was about more than just himself. He was also saying something important about companies: They can succeed whether the boss is gay or straight.

Chris Sinton fights for gay rights. He thinks Cook's announcement could make a big difference.

Apple is "the most valuable company on the planet," Sinton said. Now everyone knows that "it's run by a gay man."

Knowing that Cook is gay could mean a lot to people around the world, Sinton said. A child in Russia could read the news and change his view on what a gay person can do.

## Big Companies Can Make Changes

Tech companies are some of the richest and most powerful companies these days. Cook's announcement gives them a new opportunity. They can now push for gay rights everywhere.

Tech companies may be able to influence countries where gays are not accepted. Russia and Pakistan are two examples of such countries.

In Russia and Pakistan, gays are treated badly. In both countries, tech products are quite popular. Because of that, people may listen to tech companies. Apple and others may be able to change ideas about gays.

Leanne Pittsford is another fighter for gay rights. "These big tech companies have offices overseas," she said. Their products are very popular all over the world. Cook's announcement could make tech companies do more. They could begin to "get more involved overseas," she said.

## Open-Minded And Supportive

In the United States, tech companies have long supported gay rights. They still do more than most other kinds of companies.

For example, Apple marches in the yearly San Francisco Pride parade. The colorful parade celebrates gay life. Google has its Legalize Love effort, which concentrates on countries where being gay is against the law.

Jonathan Lovitz is also a supporter of gay rights â€” he is a gay-rights activist. Tech companies have always been open to new ideas, he says. In fact, that is what their success depends on. They have to be able to think about technology in new ways. Perhaps that makes them more open-minded in general.

Tech companies have long treated gay people well, Lovitz says. Other businesses are only now catching up. These include banks and law firms.

## Being Fair To Everyone

Many gay workers feel at home in tech companies. They are comfortable telling coworkers they are gay.

Cook is not the first tech leader to come out as gay. A number of well-known tech leaders had already done so.

One is Megan Smith, now the nation's chief technology officer. Another is Peter Thiel, PayPal's cofounder. Then there is Sam Altman, president of Y Combinator. Plus Wesley Chan, a big supporter of new tech companies. Finally, there's Nancy Vitale, a boss at Genentech.

However, tech companies still have their problems. There is plenty of work to be done before they become truly fair, activists say.

Tech companies are certainly good when it comes to gay rights. However, they have done little in other areas. They still need to hire many more women, blacks and Latinos, said Jennifer Brown, a diversity expert.

Still, Cook's announcement may encourage many. It could move people one step closer to fairness at work, Brown said. Someday we may have workplaces that treat everyone equally.
