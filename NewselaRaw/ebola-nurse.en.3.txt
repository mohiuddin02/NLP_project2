DALLAS â€” A Texas nurse is the first person to catch Ebola in the United States.

The nurse got it from an Ebola patient she was caring for in the hospital. The man, Thomas Eric Duncan, died last Wednesday. He brought the deadly disease with him from Africa when he came to visit relatives in Dallas.

The nurse discovered she had a fever Friday night, two days after Duncan died, and drove herself to the emergency room of Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas. She was placed in a special area of the hospital 90 minutes later. The area keeps her completely separate from other people to prevent the disease from spreading. A blood sample sent to the state health lab tested positive Saturday night for Ebola.

Dr. Tom Frieden runs the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). He said the nurse caught Ebola because health rules weren't followed. Health care workers must follow rules carefully when they come near anyone with Ebola. They must wear protective clothing, for instance, that covers them from head to toe, including gloves, masks and shoe covers.

## A Single Accidental Slipup

Frieden said CDC officials have spoken with the nurse. She was not sure how she may have caught Ebola.

Frieden said a person can get Ebola from even a single accidental slipup. "Unfortunately, it is possible in the coming days we will see additional cases of Ebola" in health care workers, he said.

Texas Health Commissioner David Lakey said the nurse had a lot of contact with Duncan. Ebola is contagious. However, you can't get Ebola just by being in the same room as a person with the disease. It is spread through direct contact with the blood or body fluids of an infected person. A person can only spread the disease once he or she is feeling sick. Health officials think the nurse came very close to only one person since she developed symptoms of the disease.

"We have been preparing for an event like this," Lakey said.

## No Vaccine Or Cure Yet

Presbyterian Hospital official Daniel Varga said the nurse caught Ebola during Duncan's second visit to the hospital. Duncan went to Presbyterian's emergency room for the first time on Sept. 26. He was sent home with medicine and returned to the hospital two days later, on Sept. 28. Duncan died Oct. 8. He was the first person to die of Ebola in the United States.

Officials are not saying who the nurse is.

She had been taking her temperature twice a day and checking herself for other signs of the disease. Signs of Ebola include fever, headaches and stomach pain, vomiting and diarrhea. Ebola kills 50 percent to 80 percent of the people who get it. There is no proven vaccine or cure yet.

The nurse's apartment was completely cleaned on Sunday. A team also cleaned the nurse's car and areas in her building.

## "I Wonder How She Got It"

Police officers and a CDC officials talked to her neighbors on Sunday morning. They also gave out information about Ebola symptoms.

"It just breaks my heart. She was just an innocent woman who took care of someone who was sick," said neighbor Colleen Watson.

Lindsey Carpenter said news helicopters flew over her neighborhood Sunday morning. "There's an Ebola patient in the neighborhood," her roommate told her.

Carpenter works in a nearby hospital. She said she hopes Presbyterian Hospital investigates how the nurse got Ebola.

"I wonder how she got it," Carpenter said. "It's really puzzling. There's probably more to the story that we don't know."
