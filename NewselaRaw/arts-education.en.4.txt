WASHINGTON â€” On Tuesday, Michelle Obama declared that the arts belong in school. They are an important part of a student's education, she said.

The arts, the first lady said, shouldn't just be an add-on. Art classes shouldn't be something introduced only after student test scores go up. Rather, they are a necessary part of the school day. They can help students achieve those higher test scores in the first place.

Mrs. Obama made her comments while opening the first-ever White House student talent show. At the event, student performers sang and danced. All attend schools that have been performing poorly. Their schools were chosen for a new arts education program.

By the end of the hour-long show, Mrs. Obama had joined the students on stage. She danced with them during their closing number.

## Surprise Visit By The President

President Barack Obama showed up as well. He broke away from his work to show  his support for arts in schools. The president congratulated the student performers.

Tuesday's talent show was meant to showcase the "Turnaround Arts" program. The program was created as an experiment in 2012. Its purpose is to see whether arts education can improve test scores. Famous artists adopted each school in the program.

## So Far, So Good

So far, things have been going well: Reading and math scores have gone up. Mrs. Obama announced that the program is being expanded this year based on the results. Turnaround Arts is growing from the original eight schools to 35 schools.

Two of the original schools have already improved dramatically, she said. They have improved so much they are no longer in need of "turnaround."

The arts, the first lady said, help get students excited about taking their seats in class. Students are happy to be in school. They look forward to the next musical they're performing in, or to playing an instrument.

"But if they're not in their seats then we can't teach them anything at all," Mrs. Obama said. "The bottom line here is very clear: Arts education isn't something we add on." Arts, she said, shouldn't be introduced after goals like raising test scores have been achieved. They are all-important to achieving those goals in the first place.

## Bring Arts Classes To More Schools

Six million children do not have art or music instruction in their schools, she said. Millions more get only a very slight amount.

The president made his own pitch for arts education.

"The arts are central to who we are as a people, and they are central to the success of our kids. This is not an afterthought," he said. "This is not something you do because it's kind of nice to do. It is necessary for these young people."

A few big-name artists were at the White House event. Among them were the actresses Sarah Jessica Parker and Alfre Woodard.

The stars performed with students from the schools they have adopted. They also spoke about the changes they have seen in their students.

"Our kids are glimpsing the fact that they have" worth, Woodard said. "That confidence just spreads across their lives."

## Confidence Comes Out

Students spoke about what the arts mean to them, too.

"I think that the arts are important to our school," said 8-year-old Sinai Jones. Arts education gives kids "an opportunity to see what they want to do in their life," she said. It gives them "a level of confidence."

Sinai performed with an all-girl singing group. Parker sang backup as they performed "You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile" from the musical "Annie."
