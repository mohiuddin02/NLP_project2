WASHINGTON, D.C. — The U.S. government has released new dietary guidelines. These are suggestions about what people can eat. The government comes out with new guidelines every five years.

The new guidelines say Americans still eat too much salt. There have been some changes though. The government used to say that cholesterol was unhealthy. Cholesterol is found in food like eggs. The old guidelines said that eating too much cholesterol could be bad for a person's heart. They said to eat fewer than two eggs a day. Now, the guide has taken away that number. Experts are not so sure that cholesterol is unhealthy for the heart.

## Added Sugars Aren't Healthy

The guide also put in new advice about sugar. It says that added sugar is not healthy. This is the sugar that is added to drinks like soda. It is not the sugar that occurs naturally, such as in fruit and milk. The guidelines suggest not to have too much added sugar. The amount in one large sugary drink is enough for one day. 

A group of doctors and nutrition experts came up with suggestions about what the guidelines should say. They urged people to eat food that is good for the environment. They said Americans should eat less red meat. Some research studies have found that raising cows for red meat leads to environmental problems. The cows give off methane gas that is bad for the air and environment.

People in the meat business and some lawmakers were not happy with this suggestion. They fought against it. The suggestion to eat less red meat was not included in the government guidelines. The guidelines ended up saying that red meat is part of a healthy diet. 

## Some Republicans Thought Guidelines Went Too Far

The writing of this year's guidelines led to some disagreements in government. Some Republican lawmakers were angry at President Obama. They thought he went too far in telling Americans what to eat. Republicans often disagree with Obama, who is a Democrat. They are the two main political groups in Congress.

In the end, the two sides agreed that the guidelines would be based on science. They also agreed that the guidelines would only discuss information about diet and nutrition, not the environment.

The government hopes the guidelines will help people stay healthy and avoid being overweight. The main message of the guidelines has not changed much over the years. Eat your fruits and vegetables. Eat whole grains and seafood, too. Do not eat too much sugar, fat or salt. 

## A New Message

This year, the government has a new message. It wants people to figure out which healthy eating habits work for them. The government knows everyone is different. It still wants people to follow its main ideas, but it also encourages small changes. 

"Small changes can add up to big differences," said Tom Vilsack. He works with the Agriculture Department. It is the government agency responsible for food guidelines.
