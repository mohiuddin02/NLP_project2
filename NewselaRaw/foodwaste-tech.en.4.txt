Many other Americans throw out a lot of food. Much of it could go to food pantries, but it gets tossed out instead.

## A Student Gets An Idea

There are reasons food gets wasted. Farmers throw out perfectly good fruit if it looks ugly. Grocery stores toss out tons of food. Many of us forget to eat our bananas in time. The bananas turn black on our shelves. Some of this food could go to food pantries, but it never gets there. 

Maria Rose Belding is 20 years old. She goes to college. When she was in high school she helped out at a food pantry in the state of Iowa. One day she had to throw out hundreds of boxes of mac and cheese. It was no longer good to eat. She felt bad about wasting the food. She wanted to do something about it.   

## A Website For Sharing Food

Belding studied the problem of food waste. Then she built a website that connects thousands of food pantries. The website lets food pantries share extra food. This way, it does not have to be tossed out. 

Belding has been praised for her work. Many people think her website is a good idea. It could help to end the problem of hunger. 

When Belding started thinking about her idea, she was sure someone else had the idea first. But no one else did.

## Planning, Studying, Building

It took more than a year. It was a year of planning, studying and building the program. Earlier this year, the website went online.   

Things happened very quickly for Belding's company. It now has several workers and 200 food pantries have joined.

Belding said there is still a lot of work to do. There are still 26 states that are not yet using her website. She said she had more calls to make, and more people to meet.
