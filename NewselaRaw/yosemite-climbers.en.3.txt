The 3,000-foot-high rock formation is in Yosemite National Park.

Part of El Capitan is so dangerous that no one else dared climb it before.

Down below, hundreds of people screamed as Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson pulled themselves over the top.

"It has been such a part of our lives, I miss it already," said Caldwell's father, Mike.

"I'm shaking," added Jorgeson's mother, Gaelena. She left Santa Rosa at 5 a.m. to reach Yosemite in time to witness what may be the world's most difficult free climb. In a free climb, climbers use only their hands and feet to climb up. They are attached to safety ropes in case they fall.

## "Anything Is Possible"

It took the climbers nearly six years to achieve their dream.

They had failed in 2010 because of bad weather. They failed again in 2011 when Jorgeson broke his ankle. On Wednesday, Jorgeson fell on the first section of the day's climb, slowing down the team.

Their families and loved ones have watched the men study, plan and train for years.

Jorgeson and Caldwell plan to keep coming back to Yosemite. The national park has some of the world's best rock climbs.

Caldwell has been climbing these rocks for much of his life. His father took him up one of El Capitan's 100 routes as a kid. His father called Wednesday's accomplishment "the next level in a video game."

People around the world have been watching their climb. Thousands have followed them online. The White House even tweeted a picture of President Barack Obama posing for a picture in front of a painting of Yosemite. In the tweet, he said, "You remind us that anything is possible."

## On The Rock Face

Caldwell and Jorgeson began the journey up El Capitan on Dec. 27. They have spent their nights in tents attached to the rock face, 1,200 feet above the valley floor. They climbed with bloodied fingers. They climbed after falling and days with little sleep.

Nearly straight up, the Dawn Face has little for climbers to grab on to. The route is described as the world's most difficult free climb. It was first climbed in 1970, but the climbers at the time used more tools.

Caldwell grew up in the shadow of Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado. He began climbing at 3 with his dad. He became a professional climber at 17 after winning a climbing contest.

## "Slowly And Surely"

Jorgeson also climbed as a child. He trained at an indoor climbing gym in California. Jorgeson is known as one of the world's top boulder climbers. He scurries up rocks that are 400 feet tall with enthusiasm but no ropes.

Caldwell and his wife, Rebecca Rodden, named their baby son Fitz after Mount Fitz Roy in Argentina.

Last year, Caldwell and another climber went up Fitz Roy in four days.

Caldwell's love of climbing is rubbing off on the family's next generation. His 9-year-old nephew, Grant Van Nieuwenhuyzen, looked up at El Capitan just before his uncle reached the top. "I'll try that," he said,

After the climb, Jorgeson said he hopes their climb inspires other people.

"We've been working on this thing a long time, slowly and surely," he said. "I think everyone has their own secret Dawn Wall to complete one day."
