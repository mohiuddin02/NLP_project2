WASHINGTON â€“ Thousands of job seekers come to FBI offices all across the country every year, only to be turned away from the top U.S. law enforcement agency.

The reason is not because they do not have the right work experience or education, or because they have a criminal record. They are turned down because they failed their polygraph tests. The polygraph is also known as a lie detector.

Many scientists disagree with the FBI's policy of rejecting candidates who fail the tests. They say  government agencies should not rely solely on the tests to decide whether to hire or fire someone. Experts say polygraph testing does not reliably show when somebody is actually lying, especially when they are applying for a job.

"I was called a lazy, lying, drug-dealing junkie by a man who doesn't know me, my stellar background or my societal contributions," one applicant in Baltimore wrote.  He said he was told he qualified for a job except for the polygraph test.

Government agencies use the tests on job applicants but also to question criminal suspects.

## Vague Questions, And Sweaty Palms?

Although all polygraph testing is controversial, many scientists are highly critical of its use in job screening.  They say it is especially prone to inaccuracies because the questions are often more vague than they are in criminal investigations. The questions  are therefore more likely to provoke reactions that might seem like deception.

Problems have also been shown with the measurement of sweat by a certain model of lie-detector machine. That model is used by the FBI and police departments across the country, McClatchy reporters found. Testers also measure respiration and blood pressure to determine whether someone is lying, but many see the sweat measurement as a really true sign of lying.

The manufacturer of the machine says that the problem is rare. The company also points out that other polygraphs that use the same technology might have the problem as well.

But Gene Iredale, a San Diego lawyer, said the problem could mean that agencies such as the FBI are making decisions in criminal cases and "on the basis of completely inaccurate information. The polygraph is speculative to begin with; that's why it's not admissible in court."

The bureau has polygraphed applicants since 1994. A spokeswoman for the agency said it "continues to find it a relevant and necessary tool in both employment and operational related matters."

## Others Use The Test

Records obtained by McClatchy show the FBI polygraphs about 13,000 people a year for job screening, criminal investigations and national security inquiries. According to records, the Bureau has at least a 30 percent failure rate in its job screening. As many as 40 percent of special agent applicants do not get the job because of their polygraph test results.

The Bureau is not alone in its reliance on polygraph testing. A contractor fired 10 Drug Enforcement Administration court interpreters in San Diego after the DEA said they had failed polygraphs or refused to take them. Iredale filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government over the decision. The Philadelphia Police Department says on its website that it will not hire someone who does not pass its polygraph.

Other police departments say they do not rely entirely on a polygraph test to determine whether they should hire someone.

"If someone shows deception and we're not able to clarify it, then the investigator puts that in their report and that's something we look into," said Kathy Lester, who oversees the Sacramento Police Department's hiring. "It's not just based on the polygraph," she said, adding that they will have other information that supports the findings.

However, even those who say they do not have a strict policy of barring applicants who fail the test were hard-pressed to say what they do when someone does fail the polygraph.

"We have to feel comfortable hiring someone," said Lester. Her department will polygraph about 200 people this year for positions ranging from police officers to firefighters to clerks. "If we feel somebody is deceptive based on the totality of the circumstances, then we can't hire them."

## Failed Test Follows People Everywhere

James Wedick, a retired FBI agent of 34 years who is now a private investigator in Sacramento, called the Bureau one of the "worst culprits" in its reliance on polygraph testing. He said he had repeatedly seen highly qualified people turned away who would be excellent law enforcement officers. The stigma follows them even if they try to apply elsewhere. Police departments and federal agencies often weigh whether someone previously failed a polygraph, even if they have not tested the person themselves.

"Many of these people work their entire adult lives to get a job with the Bureau," he said. "These are people who haven't done anything wrong and they've got stellar resumes and they're told, 'Sorry. You can't get a job because of the polygraph.' It's ludicrous."

Documents show that the Bureau is rejecting people even as the applicants insist they have never done anything wrong. The documents, which were given to McClatchy by polygraph researcher Katelyn Sack, also show that some applicants view the rejection as illegal discrimination. In fact, half a dozen applicants who filed the complaints thought they were discriminated against because they're African-American.

"I believe I was discriminated against as a black female," wrote one woman who applied to the Memphis, Tennessee, FBI office and was told she'd failed two polygraphs.

The first tester said the woman seemed to be lying about drug use. After she was granted another test, the second tester said she passed. A supervisor overturned that conclusion. In all the cases reviewed, the Bureau countered that the tests showed the applicants were hiding some sort of wrongdoing that was not discovered during the usual background investigation.
