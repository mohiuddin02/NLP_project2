LOS ANGELES, Calif. — Dressed to impress, Jorge Magana, 18, zipped through his presentation slides like a pro.

Magana, a senior at Los Angeles High School of the Arts, had 45 minutes to accomplish a big goal. He had to convince three judges that he was ready to graduate from high school.

The panel of judges was made up of the school's assistant principal, a school coordinator and a former student.

Magana walked the judges through his portfolio. It was like a highlight reel of all the work he had done in high school. He even included a very personal piece he had written about his father's alcoholism and how it affected his family.

## Not Just A Presentation But Questions Too

Then the panel grilled him with questions: What was your research process? What obstacles did you face? How did you overcome them? How will the skills you learned help with your future plans?

Portfolio presentations like this one are sometimes called senior defenses. They are based on the same judging process universities use to decide whether certain students should get their degrees.

Most high schools use report cards and multiple choice tests to decide which students get to graduate. Portfolio presentations are a more time-consuming way to see which students are ready to leave high school. They are also more expensive. Still, these presentations are gaining popularity in California and the rest of the nation.

Isabel Morales teaches 12th grade at Magana's school. At first, she and her co-workers thought the presentations were unnecessary. They called them "torture."

## Changing Minds, Changing Teaching

Now, Morales says, she loves seeing students reflect on what they've learned and how it has affected them. "It's hard to say this isn't a good idea," she said.

"Watching the defenses taught me how much my lessons count," Morales said. She recognized that just teaching students would not be enough — Morales needed to help them make real changes and start using what they had learned, she said.

Students can simply "go through the motions" in class, taking in information without really understanding it, she said. Portfolio defenses force them to explain what they have learned, and to apply it in different ways.

Stanford University professors Soung Bae and Linda Darling-Hammond recently published a report about graduation requirements. They recommended that California allow schools to use "well-designed" portfolios in place of traditional exit exams.

## Portfolios Cover Areas Missed By Tests

Professors Bae and Darling-Hammond said that multiple choice tests do not cover the skills that students develop when they do challenging projects. They said portfolios should include tough assignments like essays and artwork.

Eventually, the Los Angeles Unified School District plans to require each high school senior to present a portfolio. Ten high schools are already testing the program and there are plans to get more schools on board next school year.

Cathy Kwan is in charge of the portfolio presentation program at Los Angeles High School of the Arts. She says students have shown a huge improvement since the program first started.

Kwan is a fan of the senior defense program, but said it is too soon to require students to pass in order to graduate. She says teachers are still learning how to give students the tools they need to present their portfolios well. Holding them back because of their presentation would not be fair, she said.

Magana failed his portfolio defense because he did not show the judges how much he knew about his projects. He did not do a good job explaining his research.

## Preparing Students To Show What They Know

Morales says watching her students present their defenses has taught her a lot about how to prepare her students. Like Magana, many students struggle to communicate what they know.

Morales believes that the best preparation for a defense is to make time in class for students to share their work and talk about what they have learned. It's something she did not always do until now, she said.

Magana got another shot and passed his second defense a week later. He said he's learned from his mistakes and will not repeat them when he heads to the University of California, Riverside, this fall to study computer science.

"I'm worried that in college I won't have anyone there to push me," Magana said. "But I have this experience to refer back to. I will remember this. I won't allow myself to fail again."

Of the 92 seniors who presented their portfolios this year, 33 failed. Those students were scheduled to redo their presentations and, in the end, everyone passed. They were all allowed to graduate.

"Not one of them gave up," Kwan said.
