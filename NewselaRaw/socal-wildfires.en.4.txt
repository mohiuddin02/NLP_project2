SAN DIEGO â€” On Wednesday, dangerous brush fires broke out in northern San Diego County. The fires popped up in more than six areas. During the day, the flames spread rapidly. The fires got bigger because of hot, dry winds and extremely high temperatures.

The San Diego fires forced many evacuations. People hurried to leave schools, businesses and homes near the fires.

The most destructive of the blazes was the Poinsettia fire in Carlsbad. Eight homes, an apartment building and two businesses were destroyed or damaged.

Homeowners had only minutes to get out. They gathered treasured belongings and pets and ran.

"There was just no time," said Greg Staska, 63, whose home was destroyed. "But it's OK, I'm alive."

## "A Bad Day"

By day's end, the Carlsbad fire was no longer spreading. However, it was still not contained and trouble spots remained. According to Fire Chief Michael Davis, firefighters have "days of work to be done."

Meanwhile, the Tomahawk fire at Camp Pendleton burned more than 6,000 acres. It forced evacuations of two housing areas and two schools.

Erik Bye, who works at a 24 Hour Fitness gym, experienced two fires. At work in Carlsbad, he saw smoke from the Poinsettia fire approaching. "The smoke just kept growing, growing, growing," he said. "It wouldn't stop. We weren't sure what to do."

He raced home to San Marcos where he felt it would be safe. Instead, a fire erupted there and covered his neighborhood with smoke. Without waiting for firefighters to tell him to evacuate, Bye left.

"It's been a bad day," Bye said. Others in northern San Diego County agreed.

## Thick Black Smoke

Various evacuation centers were set up for those fleeing Wednesday's fires. Among them were schools, a shopping center, a senior center and a golf course. Several people with large trailers volunteered to move neighbors' horses to safety.

And in the canyons next to Rancho Santa Fe and Fairbanks Ranch, firefighters continued to battle the Bernardo fire. The fire started on Tuesday and by early Wednesday it had burned 1,500 acres.

"It's like a scene from Armageddon," one homeowner said. Above him, thick black smoke blotted out the sun.

Hundreds of homes and businesses were evacuated as the Bernardo blaze raged out of control. Several schools and libraries were emptied out as well.

## Racing From Fire To Fire

Legoland in Carlsbad was closed, leaving disappointed vacationers.

Heath and Gina Seifert of Glendale were heading to the theme park with their two daughters. Suddenly, the traffic on the freeway locked up. News of the fire began to spread.

"They were like, 'Where's Legoland from here,'" Heath said of his daughters. "We were like, 'It might be on fire.'"

Legoland did not burn. However, the rides were shut down and the park was evacuated.

All day long, county firefighters raced from fire to fire.

As bad as Wednesday's fires were, San Diego County has known worse. Many remember raging fires in 2003 and 2007.

People in the area have seen big fires before, said state official Dave Jones. They are "all too familiar with the destructive force of wildfires."
