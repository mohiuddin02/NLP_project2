ALEPPO, Syria â€” Entering the prayer room of an ancient mosque, a teenager named Hussein Mansour plopped himself down. He placed a grenade and a small bag of pretzels on the table. Hussein and the others in the room are rebels: that means they are fighting against the Syrian government. Their goal is to remove President Bashar Assad.

Hussein picked up the grenade again. Then, he pretended to pull the ring. Another rebel fighter, Abu Musab, looked over at the 16-year-old.

"I mean, he's carrying a grenade and a 3-cent bag of chips," he said, shaking his head. "It doesn't fit. He's too young."

## Following His Family

As the Syrian civil war rages on, hundreds of exhausted rebel fighters are quitting. Many others are being killed daily. More and more, teenagers like Hussein are taking their place.

Thirteen of Hussein's uncles and cousins have been killed fighting government forces. Now Hussein carries the rifle used by one of his dead cousins. He picks it up often, like it's a new toy.

Hussein took a break from fiddling with the rifle and motioned to the gun rack beside him. "These are just rifles my 6-year-old brother could shoot."

In a war that has already claimed more than 190,000 lives, boys like Hussein expect to die. Most seem to live by the words often heard in rebel areas: "It's all one death."

## Too Many Teen Soldiers

There are now more than 5,300 child fighters among the rebels. There are 2,000 more with pro-government forces. Most are between the ages of 14 and 17.

Many worry about the effects of having so many teenagers fighting. They fear it will make Syria a tougher place even after the war ends. Fighting may become a habit for the teens.

Rebel groups say they don't look for fighters younger than 18. But their situation is desperate. No one willing to fight is turned away.

Here at the mosque, a religious temple for Muslims, things are quiet these days.

Government soldiers are just a few hundred feet away. Still, they have not tried to storm the mosque in more than six months.

All the rebels wear street clothes: They expect to spend their days not fighting, but lounging on old sofas. They take turns watching 10 televisions that give them a view of the area around the mosque. Things may be quiet, but they can never let down their guard. After all, government troops are waiting nearby.

## No More School For Now

As others around him chatted, 16-year-old Majid stared at the TVs.

Fighting was Majid's idea. His father is a rebel fighter at another battle line in the city. At first he did not want his son to join too. Then his father's friend, a rebel commander, pushed for Majid to be allowed to fight. His father gave in. Majid's mother still does not think he should be a fighter.

Majid said he lied to her and told her that there are no government soldiers nearby. "She thinks I'm far away from the front line."

Majid had just finished seventh grade when his school was shut down because of the war. He insisted he would finish his education when the fighting was over.

Aamir Mansour, five years older, turned to Majid. "Why, you think you're going to live?" he asked.

"No," Majid said quietly.
