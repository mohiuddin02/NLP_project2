DALLAS — Like many 20-somethings, Cole Leonard has reached a crossroads in his life. He must decide whether he should follow a safe job path or go for a dream that might not work out.

Unlike many people his age, Leonard must choose between becoming a lawyer and dying on the surface of Mars.

It's a difficult decision for the 27-year-old. Leonard has been accepted into law school. But he is also one of 705 people competing to be part of the first human colony on Mars.

The journey is being organized by a group called Mars One. Last year, the group began inviting would-be colonists to step forward. So far, more than 200,000 people from around the world have signed up. The list will be whittled down to 24 by next year.

## It's Cold, Dusty And You Can't Breathe

Each colonist would undergo at least eight years of training. They'd learn about space travel. And they would learn how to live on a very dangerous planet. Mars has scary dust storms and temperatures colder than minus 200 degrees. It doesn't even have breathable air.

And there's this one big catch: With current technology, there is no way to return from Mars. It would be a one-way trip.

All that sounds like a good deal to Leonard.

Still, he doesn't much fit the bill of an astronaut. He doesn't have much training in flight, engineering, agriculture or medicine. When you get down to it, he doesn't yet have any of the necessary skills.

But in other ways, he said, he's a perfect choice. He's young and healthy. He has always been interested in space. And, more importantly, he is deeply excited by the idea of exploring.

For some reason, he said, people think that exploring ended with Columbus.

## No Shopping Malls On Mars

Still, there's some uncertainty on his part. Before leaving Earth, he'd want to be sure that everything was carefully planned. After all, he would hate to run out of food or power or water 34 million miles from home.

Leonard has simpler worries, too. He can't study to become a lawyer and train to be an astronaut at the same time. He's hesitant to give up law school for a dream that may not become real.

He'd also miss a lot if he moved to Mars. He'd miss music and simple, everyday things like relaxing outdoors on a patio. There are still lots of places on Earth he hasn't seen. And, of course, there's his family, who don't want him to go.

"They flip between" being angry and "thinking it's all a joke," Leonard said.

His twin, Mitchell, said that's not completely true. The family thinks he'd be a good pick. They just don't want him to leave the planet. They also wouldn't want him to regret his decision as he journeys through space.

"The whole family knows that Cole can get picked," said Mitchell. "They already see him flying off into the sky."

## Mars Is Not So Scary

Leonard said he understands that law school would be a more practical choice — and one that might lengthen his life. But certain death on Mars doesn't scare him, he said. After all, death is certain everywhere.

If he becomes a lawyer, he said, "I am going to die here in some crappy retirement home in Florida." If he's going to die anyway, he feels, why not do it somewhere exciting, like Mars?
