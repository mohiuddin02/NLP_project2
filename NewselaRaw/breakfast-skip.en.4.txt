WASHINGTON â€” Food experts say breakfast is important. They say skipping breakfast will make you fat.

Is that really true? Scientists in New York tested the idea. Their results might surprise some people.

The U.S. Dietary Guidelines is the government's food advice book. It tells people to eat breakfast every day. Skipping breakfast is not healthy. If you do, you will gain weight, the book says.

## Breakfast Skippers Lost Weight

The scientists wondered if this was right. They did an experiment at a New York hospital to find out.

There were three groups of people in the experiment. The first group ate oatmeal for breakfast. The second group ate frosted corn flakes. The third group ate nothing. The only group to lose weight was the third group. They skipped breakfast.

Other experiments also show the government book is wrong. People lost weight or nothing happened at all.

## Old Information Is Wrong

The Dietary Guidelines book is important. Schools use it to plan school lunches. People also use it to learn about healthy eating. This year, the book will be updated. A group of food experts will add new information.

Scientists say the old breakfast information is wrong. The experiments were not done right. Some scientists think there is not enough proof.

The food experts from the government think it was enough proof, though. Eating breakfast became part of the old book. It is in the section about losing weight.
