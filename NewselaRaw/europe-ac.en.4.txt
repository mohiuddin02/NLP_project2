VIENNA, Austria â€” It is hotter than ever in Europe. It was one of the hottest summers ever. In some countries there, it has been over 100 degrees.

In Europe, most people do not use air conditioning (AC). They do not like it.

That makes Europe different from the United States. Many U.S. places have air conditioning. It helps people in warm states like Florida and Texas.

## Cold AC, Hot Planet

Europeans say that air conditioning causes more greenhouse gases. The planet is heating up because of these gases. It is called global warming.

Greenhouse gases are caused by power plants. Air conditioners need electricity to work. Power plants burn fossil fuels to make electricity. Coal and gas are fossil fuels. They release greenhouse gases.

## U.S. Too Cold Inside For Europeans

Europeans think it is too cold indoors in the United States. They do not like the cold inside. Some Europeans say it makes them sick.

Not many homes in Germany are air conditioned. Some people wonder if that should change. Summers are getting hotter. Not Texas or Florida hot, but very hot for Europe.

## A German Train's Air Conditioner On Fire

Germany's trains, for example, have air conditioning. But there is a problem. The air conditioning works only when the hottest outside temperature is 89.6 degrees or below. It will not work when it gets hotter. The windows also do not open on the trains. That can make the trains even hotter inside.

On Aug. 3, a high-speed train was sitting at the station. Suddenly one of its air conditioners caught on fire.

Places in Germany close when it is too hot inside.

Germany will probably not get more air conditioning. Germany's government is against it. Germany's leaders say air conditioning is bad for the planet.

The problem is what to do on really hot days. No one is sure what to do if there is another summer like 2003. That year, many Europeans died from the heat.
