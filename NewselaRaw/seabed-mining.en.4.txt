KINGSTON, Jamaica â€” The deep oceans cover most of the world. The freezing water has never been touched by people.

Now, things are changing. We might be traveling into the ocean's deepest areas soon. Scientists say machines will soon be going under water to explore.

There are valuable rocks and minerals at the bottom of the sea. Sometimes there is copper or cobalt. These can be used to make smartphones or other high-tech tools. There is also gold at the bottom of the ocean.

There are not enough of these minerals on land. Companies are hoping we can mine them under water.

## Group Must Give Permission For Mining

A group called the International Seabed Authority (ISA) is in charge of the underwater world. It has been giving certain people permission to explore the ocean floor. This makes some people upset.

Matthew Gianni is upset. He cares about the environment. Gianni thinks scientists should study what will happen before they take minerals from the bottom of the ocean.

So far, people have been exploring the Pacific Ocean. It is near Mexico and the United States. The area has a lot of precious minerals. Still, people are not allowed to touch some of the rocks.

## Scientists Worry About Hurting The Oceans

Scientists want to study the other oceans as well.

Douglas McCauley is a scientist in California. He thinks many more people will be exploring the bottom of the sea. He is worried about what will happen.

Hundreds of years ago, people began exploring more land. They hunted animals. They hurt ecosystems. McCauley is worried humans will destroy the oceans, too.

He says there are certain things people can do to be smart about exploring the oceans. First, they can learn what plants and animals are down there. They can explore slowly. Third, they can make sure some areas are protected before they start mining underwater.
