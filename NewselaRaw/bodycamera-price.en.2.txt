WASHINGTON — In the wake of many high-profile cases between officers and the public, police departments across the country are feeling pressure to equip officers with body cameras. Despite the push to buy the new cameras, however, states and cities have encountered a serious problem to adopting the technology: the cost.

The price of a single camera ranges from less than $100 to more than $1,000. The cost varies depending on the number of cameras purchased and whether the deal includes video storage services. In addition to buying the cameras, departments also must pay for storing the video. The technology is also fairly new, which means it is likely to have to be replaced after a short time, which would require additional spending.

## Cameras Come With Concerns

In a survey of police departments, nearly 40 percent of those without body cameras said the primary reason they did not have them was due to cost.

President Barack Obama recently called for $75 million in new federal spending to help pay for 50,000 body cameras for police across the country. Yet, many states are struggling with how to deal with the cameras and cover what is not paid by the federal government. There are mixed opinions on when cameras should be worn and whether the video should be public.

"They (cameras) can be a really great tool if implemented correctly," said Lindsay Miller, a researcher who studies issues facing police across the country. "It's not as easy as sticking a camera on an officer and sending them out in the field."

In New Jersey, a law passed last fall requires some officers to carry cameras, or equip the cars they use during traffic patrols with a camera. The camera would be placed on the car's dashboard.

Police who work in desk jobs or who do not regularly conduct traffic stops do not need to wear a camera. The state will pay for it by charging drunk drivers an extra $25 fine.

## Digging Through State Budgets

In other states, lawmakers have a different approach to paying for cameras. They are calling for state money to help pay for a technology they see as a necessity.

For many states, finding money to pay for the cameras is a struggle. Politicians are getting creative in locating funds in state budgets — the amount a state plans to spend in a year. A bill, or a proposed law, in Texas would dedicate $50 million in state money to require that officers across the state wear cameras.

Some lawmakers in South Carolina are trying to find $21.5 million in the state budget to pay for cameras. In April, Walter Scott, an African-American, was shot in the back and killed by a white police officer. Scott was running from the officer in North Charleston, South Carolina. The shooting was captured on cellphone video by someone who was nearby. The incident is putting pressure on state lawmakers to find a better way to hold officers accountable for their actions.

## Video Storage Challenge

One survey found most agencies spent between $800 and $1,200 per camera to buy them. That can be a daunting price tag for departments already strapped for cash.

While paying for the cameras can be a challenge, there are many ongoing costs associated with the programs that can be difficult for agencies as well. The New Orleans Police Department plans to purchase 350 body cameras. But it is budgeting $1.2 million over five years, mostly for the cost of storing video.

Many states are facing the challenge of video storage. In some instances, lawmakers are focused on how long departments should have to keep video, and if or when recordings should be made public.

Officers could potentially record millions of videos a year around the country. These clips could be used as part of a criminal proceeding, a public records request or for another purpose. The cost of downloading, logging, handling and storing all that video can be staggering.

## "There's A Lot Of Work To Be Done"

Clearfield, Utah, is a city of about 30,000 located 30 miles north of Salt Lake City. The local police department has struggled with managing the recorded videos from police cameras. The police department there has been using body cameras since 2010. But recently, video storage problems got so serious that the department had to temporarily use DVDs to store the videos. They had run out of space on computer servers.

New camera models may solve some problems. They typically last longer and have greater storage capacity. However, newer cameras record high-definition video. These video files are much larger, which contributes to the storage dilemma.

"It's just become pretty muddy about what's going to happen in the future," said Mike Stenquist, an assistant police chief in Clearfield. "There's a lot of work to be done."
