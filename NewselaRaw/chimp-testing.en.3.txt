WASHINGTON â€” The U.S. government wants to give greater protection to chimpanzees.

Currently, only wild chimpanzees are listed as endangered. Captive chimps, such as pets or those in research labs, are listed as threatened.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service wants to count both as [endangered](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species). And it has proposed limiting the use of the chimpanzee, one of man's closest genetic cousins, in scientific research.

Animal rights groups praised the move. The treatment of chimps has been a hot topic of debate for years.

## Used In AIDs Research

In the mid-1980s, scientists were trying to understand HIV, which causes the disease AIDS. Since humans and chimps are closely related, scientists infected chimps with HIV. The researchers hoped doing so would lead to a cure, treatment or both.

At least 198 chimps were infected with HIV. But only one developed an AIDS-like disease, and died.

Despite their similarities to humans, chimps don't react to infection the same way. Researchers developed a vaccine for HIV, but it only protected chimps, not people. An article in the British Medical Journal concluded: "When it comes to testing HIV vaccines, only humans will do."

In early 2011, Ajit Varki of the University of California-San Diego found that chimps and humans experience disease differently. That called into question the usefulness of the chimps as human stand-ins for research.

## Chimp Population Drop

There are about 2,000 captive chimpanzees in the U.S., according to Fish and Wildlife.

Since 1960, the number of chimpanzees has dropped steeply. The latest count put the worldwide population of chimps at 300,000 to 430,000. They are endangered by humans moving into their habitats, and by hunting.

The capture of chimpanzees for the international pet trade is another reason for their decline. Killing a female chimp who has an infant means twice the pay for a hunter. The mother's body is sold for meat, and the infant gets sold as a pet.

If Fish and Wildlife's plan is approved, some activities involving chimps will require legal permission.

For example, buying a chimp from another state will require a permit. The import and export of chimpanzees in and out of the U.S. will also require a permit. So will activities that could harm or disturb a chimpanzee, especially in research. Selling chimpanzee blood or other medical samples between states will likewise require permits.

## Research To Help Chimps

Some medical research could still be allowed under the new plan. But the service said such research will be limited. Only studies that are helpful to the chimpanzee species will be allowed.

People have argued about the use chimpanzees in science for years. But the conversation is changing. New technologies are helping researchers. Knowledge once gained only by examining a live animal now can be learned in a test tube. In addition, more and more evidence shows that chimpanzees don't work as well as human models.

Feelings about animal research also have evolved in recent years. More people believe that chimps should be spared the pain and stress of research.

When it comes to studying human diseases, the primates just make bad test subjects, said Dr. John J. Pippin of the group Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, who applauded the move.
