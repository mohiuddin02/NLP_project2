JOSHUA TREE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. â€” Andre Saraiva owns clubs in Paris and New York. He edits a men's fashion magazine. But he is also a graffiti artist known around the world.

Saraiva is best known for painting cartoon figures on buildings, mailboxes and streets all over Paris. Two months ago, a photo of a boulder he painted showed up on a hiking website. The rock was located not in someone's backyard, but in California's Joshua Tree National Park.

American nature lovers have said that what Saraiva did was disgraceful.

Saraiva is of a new generation of graffiti artists. They do not paint graffiti on buildings or trains. Instead, they think of nature as their sketchpad. They tag national parks, then post photos of their work on the Internet.

## Seeing Graffiti Is "Like Getting Punched In The Gut"

The issue is complicated, said Casey Schreiner, the editor of Modern Hiker, where the boulder photo appeared. "How different is graffiti in national parks than street art? If street art is OK, is this OK?"

Schreiner asked if there is a connection between the two.

"National parks are special places for most Americans," he said. "Seeing them marked up is like getting punched in the gut."

Federal officials say the amount of graffiti is up in some parks, even as it has been declining in most others. The worst are parks near big cities. Two of them that have experienced a rise in graffiti are Golden Gate National Recreation Area near San Francisco and Joshua Tree, not far from Los Angeles.

## A Greater Acceptance For Graffiti

In 2013, graffiti artists tagged the popular Rattlesnake Canyon in Joshua Tree. Then in February, someone painted a large, bright blue giraffe on a boulder in the national park. About the same time, someone painted an enormous skull on the wall of a historical structure.

"That makes me sick," muttered backpacker Steve Axthelm, of Portland, Oregon.

Humans have been leaving marks in nature. Ancient tribes put outlines of handprints on cave walls.

These days, on the Internet, people are accepting graffiti more and more as an art form. You can find examples of graffiti on private property, like buildings. Google recently launched a website featuring street art around the world.

## New Tools Being Used In Graffiti Fight

In the modern art world, tagging a wall is seen as old fashioned, said Jeremy Cross, an artist in California. Tagging a national park is the next new thing, although a lot of people hate it.

A petition was started on whitehouse.gov after similar-looking graffiti was found in eight different national parks and monuments in the American West. The petition urges the government to take legal action against the graffiti artist.

The National Park Service thinks the artist is Casey Nocket, 22, of New York, said a spokesman. Selfies of a young woman, believed to be Nocket, painting colorful faces on rocks and boulders have been posted on California hiking websites. They are signed with the phraise "Creepytings 2014." Officials suspect Nocket is responsible for the graffiti in the parks, including Joshua Tree.

Park officials are fighting back with hidden video cameras to catch the graffiti artists in the act, said David Smith. He is superintendent of Joshua Tree. Also, a new computer program will let officials compare graffiti done in different parks.

The hiking community is trying to stop it. Schreiner said Modern Hiker never intended to investigate graffiti, but the issue has caught fire. "So it's one of the things we do now, full time," he said.

## More People Opposing Graffiti

Schreiner added that feelings against the artists are growing strong.

Saraiva is the best-known artist who has painted in a national park. He has been attacked by nature lovers since his "OX" mark appeared on the boulder at Joshua Tree.

He has denied that the boulder was even in the park, posting on Instagram that it was done in a friend's backyard.

Readers then decided to investigate and found the boulder's exact location. Their conclusion? It was definitely on national park grounds.

His lawyer said what Saraiva did was unimportant and also that he had used erasable paint.

On April 1, Saraiva paid a fine of $275, officials said.

Meanwhile, some private businesses said there is too much attention on graffiti in national parks. They are hit by graffiti artists all the time and are constantly painting it over.

"I wish they were just as outraged over graffiti on other people's private property," said Lena Kent. She is a spokeswoman for Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway. Its freight cars and train engines are tagged every day.
