BALTIMORE, Md. — These are the sounds of baseball: the crack of a wooden bat hitting a ball; the pop of a ball hitting a glove; the organ; the cheering fans.

The game in Baltimore on Wednesday had it all. Except for the fans.

On April 29, for the first time in Major League Baseball's long history, a game was played with no fans in the stands.

Baltimore was torn apart by riots last week over the death of Freddie Gray, a young black man. Gray died a week after being arrested by Baltimore police. Buildings have been burned and police officers attacked. The city was in chaos. It is just now calming down.

## Worried About Safety

That's why no fans were allowed in the stadium. Still, the game had to go on. Major League Baseball teams play 162 games a season. Each team must play all the games on its schedule. That makes the standings fair at the end of the season.

On Thursday, no one enjoyed the beautiful weather. No one snacked on Maryland crab cakes or booed the umpire.

There were three people in the 45,971 green seats at Camden Yards. They were scouts who worked for the teams. The rest of the seats were empty.

In the press box, reporters and TV announcers shook their heads. They had never seen anything like it.

The game moved quickly. It lasted about two hours, which is short for baseball. It was especially strange during the seventh-inning stretch. It is traditional for fans to stand up, stretch their legs and sing along with "Take Me Out to the Ballgame." There was no one who needed to stretch, and no one to sing along.

No fans were allowed because of the angry riots.

## If Fans Don't Come "It's A Shame"

Playing a professional sport with no fans watching got players and coaches thinking: If there are no fans, is it still worth playing? And if the fans are not needed, why do they watch?

Adam LaRoche is the first baseman for the White Sox. He said having no fans had taken away some of the meaning of the game.

"It's a big part of why we come out here and do what we do," he said in the dugout before the game. "It's a shame that it's come to them not being able to come out and (enjoy) the game."

White Sox pitching coach Don Cooper admitted that playing in an empty stadium was "weird" and "different."

He had thought a lot of this, he said. For this game, the players would find to find their own motivation, and not rely on the fans' energy, he said.

"If a ball goes into the seats and nobody sees it, is it still a home run? You bet it is," said Cooper.

## Fans Gathered Outside And Cheered

Buck Showalter is the manager of the Orioles. His voice matters here in Baltimore. He spoke about the riots. Showalter said it's not his place to imagine why the city had exploded in anger.

He couldn't possibly understand the experience of young black men, he said. Still, Showalter hoped his team could rally the city and bring people together.

"I want us to learn from some stuff that's gone on, from both sides of it," he said.

Outside the stadium's gates, a small group of fans peered in. They provided the games only cheers: "O-R-I-O-L-E-S … Let's go, O's!"

## Watching With A Broken Heart

The best views of the game were across the street, in the Hilton Hotel tower overlooking the stadium. Orioles and White Sox banners hung from balconies.

"You're taking away from the fans, but I understand there is bigger stuff going on than baseball right now," said Benjamin Fluke, age 19. He was watching the game from outside.

Richard Messick has lived in Baltimore his whole life. He sat on a post on the sidewalk watching the strange, silent game.

"It breaks my heart that it had to come to this," he said, speaking of the riots. As for the game, he doesn't see why fans were kept out.
