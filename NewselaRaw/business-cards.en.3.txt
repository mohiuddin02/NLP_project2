SPOKANE VALLEY, Wash. — Once a month collectors gather at Spokane Valley Sportscards. They break open sealed boxes of cards, looking for what they call a hit. They're all after players with big names. They want the ones whose cards are worth hundreds of dollars.

Joseph Branda is one of the regulars. He's known for taking risks.

He once bought a $600 box of basketball cards. He has a collection that could be worth as much as a car. On this Saturday, as the others hold back their spending, he asked for another box of football cards, spending $140 on it.

Leaning over a counter, Branda, 22, quickly sorts through the box. He rips open six packs and flips through a lineup of football players.

## "Oh, that's awesome!"

He tosses aside most of them. Then Branda's eyes widen and he breaks into a smile.

"RG III!" he calls out.

It's a hit. He's scored Robert Griffin III, the starting quarterback for the Washington football team. The card is autographed. It also has a piece of his jersey attached to it.

All conversation in the room stops, and several of the others huddle around him. They stare at the card.

"Whoa!"

"Oh, that's awesome!"

The shop's owner, Alan Bisson, looks up the value: $150.

"That's what I'm looking for!" Branda says. "Every hit from here on out is profit."

## Hoping For The Big-Name Card

The third Saturday of each month is trading night. Adults gather alongside college students and kids too young to have seen Michael Jordan play basketball. There's never more than a dozen.

The regulars who come to Bisson's shop are not interested, however, in making trades.

They're here for the thrill of the hit. They come month after month, hoping they will turn up one of the cards made to be a collectible, because only a limited number were printed.

"It's like pulling the handle on a slot machine," says Bisson, 60, who admits that he's one of his own best customers. "It's the chance of pulling the big one."

His love of cards (or addiction, depending on how you look at it) is what drew him into this business. Twenty years ago, he got into the business with a salesman at a card shop.

Bisson's the only one still left, running the store from an old house.

In what was once a cozy living room, racks of card boxes block the windows. The fireplace is hidden behind shelves of cards.

On good days, maybe a dozen people walk in, but there are many days, though, when it's just Bisson.

## Many Outgrow Card Collecting ...

A number of those who show up are looking to sell rather than buy. Their collections usually date to the early 1990s, when sports cards were popular. Now they've got boxes of memorabilia that are as good as garbage because the cards are so common.

Most of the card business, Bisson says, has moved online. At the moment, trading night keeps the shop in business.

Zach, 9, may be the youngest there, but he's just one of the guys. Zach has been coming since December. He picked up a love for sports from his father.

"Instead of watching cartoons in the morning," Zach says, "I get up and watch 'Sports Center.'"

At some point, many kids outgrow the hobby. Branda has inherited many of his friends' collections. He has about 400,000 cards.

## ... But They Haven't

The regulars say their family, their friends — wives and girlfriends, especially — don't get it: Why would they spend so much money on cards?

"It's a better hobby than doing drugs and being in a gang," says Scott Brewster, a 20-year-old junior in college.

Their expensive hobby also sometimes brings profit. Branda has sold a card, signed by eight Yankees who played in the 1996 World Series, for $750. Brewster made $300 in profit on a card with the autographs of the NBA's San Antonio Spurs Tim Duncan and David Robinson. He bought it for just $25 at a yard sale.

As trading night winds down, Bisson writes their charges on slips of paper. He adds up the tab. One of his better customers racks up a tab of $643.50. It's so big that he doesn't want the amount printed with his name. He's worried what his wife will say.

Branda owes $260, while Brewster owes $140. He pays some of it with a debit card, a little more in cash. He will pay the rest when he's back next month, with more money and ready to try his luck again.
