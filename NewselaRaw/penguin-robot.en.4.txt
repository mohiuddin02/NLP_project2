Robots can help humans visit places that are hard to get to. In the past, humans have used different types of robots to go to the moon or Mars. Now, scientists have created a robot that will take us to a land that is fluffy and cute. The robots will watch families of penguins in the wild.

A team of scientists recently built a robot that wears a disguise. The robot looks like a baby penguin. The robot penguin can move around Antarctica. It is a cold continent where colonies of penguins live. The robot penguin will be able to get very close to the birds. Real penguins do not seem to mind the robot.

## Robots Are More Welcome Than Humans

It is challenging for humans to study animals in the wild. Animals react in different ways when they are approached by humans. They usually get scared. Their hearts start beating faster. This is dangerous for penguins.

It can also be bad for scientists. The penguins may have a hard time having babies after a human scares them. Scientists will then find it difficult to get information. Using robots, they can learn more about the birds.

Researchers are using a robot with groups of king penguins in Antarctica. They are watching to see what penguins do when a robot gets close. Then they compare it with how the penguin acts around humans. They found that penguins are more scared of humans than robots.

When a king penguin feels scared, it tries to run away. If a human comes near, the penguin will go far away. If a robot comes near the penguin, it might move a little. The penguin is less afraid of the robot.

## Nice To Meet You, Fuzzy Robot Penguin

Scientists used the robot with another type of penguins in Antarctica as well. The penguins were emperor penguins.

About half of the emperor penguins that researchers studied did not even notice the robot. Almost one-fourth of the penguins actually moved closer to look at the robot. The other one-fourth were scared and moved away.

The scientists also used a different style of robot with the emperor penguins. This model was friendlier. It was dressed up like a fuzzy baby penguin on wheels. It was a hit with the live birds.

When the dressed-up robot spy got close, all of the adult and baby penguins were interested. They moved toward the rover. Some penguins even tried to talk to the furry robot.

## Let's Try Other Animal Robots

Researchers are trying out the robot with other types of animals besides birds. On a recent day, they used the robot with some elephant seals. The seals did not seem to notice the robot coming near their heads or tails. Scientists were pleased. Elephant seals usually do not like it when someone or something gets close to their backsides.

It is exciting to think about how robots can help humans learn more about animals in the wild. Who knows? Maybe rovers in the future might also be able to follow creatures in the water and in the air.
