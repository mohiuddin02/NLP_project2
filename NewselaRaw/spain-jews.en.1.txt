SEATTLE, Wash. — On a recent morning, Doreen Alhadeff sat with a roomful of people dedicated to keeping alive Ladino, a centuries-old Jewish language spoken by Jews of Spanish origin, and explained why she plans to become a Spanish citizen.

"It's symbolic," said Alhadeff. "For me, it's something that was taken from my ancestors and I want it back."

Spain expelled the Jews in 1492 during the Inquisition. The Jews were told to convert to Catholicism or leave the country. Most Spanish Jews, also called Sephardic, went to the Ottoman Empire, in what is today Turkey. Following a renewed interest in this part of its past, Spain passed a law in June to offer citizenship rights to the descendants of the Sephardic who were forced to leave.

The descendants will be allowed to have dual citizenship, in both Spain and the country which they call home.

## Sephardic Pioneers In Puget Sound

There are, however, conditions — and resentment toward a country that produced a tragic moment in Sephardic history — that are causing Seattle's unusually large and active Sephardic population to view the offer with mixed emotions.

"They kicked us out and now they're making us go through hoops?" said Victor Amira. He is a member of a group known as the "Ladineros" that meets weekly at The Summit at First Hill, a Jewish retirement community, to study Ladino.

Amira was talking about requirements that include passing Spanish language and culture tests and traveling to Spain to finalize the paperwork. He was also reacting to an article passed around among the Ladineros that put the cost of applying at $5,600.

Alhadeff, who had come to brief the group as part of an ongoing effort to spread the word, labeled the figure "ridiculous" and said it was wrong. Alhadeff said the application fee is currently pegged at 100 euros, slightly more in U.S. dollars.

Spain, Alhadeff said, is spending a lot of time and energy making amends. "It's not for everybody," she said. "I think it's got to ring to you on another level."

It rings for Alhadeff, who co-founded a website for the local Sephardic community and belongs to a prominent family within it. Her grandmother Dora Levy is believed to be the first Sephardic woman to come to Seattle, arriving in 1906.

Sephardic pioneers, most from Turkey and Greece, built a community with a culture and language different from the Yiddish-speaking Ashkenazi Jews of Europe. The Sephardic population around Seattle's Puget Sound numbers about 5,000, according to a 2014 Jewish Federation survey. That makes the Sephardic community the third largest in the country, after New York and Los Angeles.

## "Mi Alma" Means "My Soul"

Alhadeff, a 64-year-old real estate agent, grew up hearing her grandparents speak Ladino. Her grandmother, an especially important figure in her life, used to call Alhadeff "mi alma," an endearment the younger woman didn't think much about, until she went to Spain as a college student and heard someone in a cafe use the term. "I almost fell out of my chair," said Alhadeff, who just then realized that the endearment stemmed from the Spanish words for "my soul." It was one of the things that made her feel a deep connection with Spain.

This spring, she strengthened her connection. She lived in Spain for three months, while helping organize an international conference of Sephardic Jews. Only about 40,000 Jews live in Spain today, but the government has made a commitment to righting its past abuses, as Alhadeff sees it.

Alhadeff visited the town of Avila, where the government preserved an ancient Jewish cemetery. She went to another town, until recently called Castrillo Matajudios (Spanish for Camp Kill Jews), where the people voted to change its name to Castrillo Mota de Judios (Jews' Hill Camp). "The Spain of today is clearly not the Spain of 1492," Alhadeff said.

But others wonder if this is a move by Spain to attract Jewish business, investment and tourism. That is how Rabbi Marc Angel, director of the Institute for Jewish Ideas and Ideals in New York, put it in a blog post last year.

## Some Sephardic Jews Look To Turkey

Then there's the fact that not all Sephardic Jews see Spain as the central point of their identity. "My parents were born in Turkey," said Ladinero member Marlene Souriano-Vinikoor. "I feel very strongly that I am Turkish," agreed Ladinero leader Isaac Azose, who traces his roots to the Turkish island of Marmara and said he prefers to honor Turkey as "the country that took us in."

Devin Naar, a professor at the University of Washington, says Seattle's Sephardic community has hung onto the customs of the Ottoman empire. Seattle's Sephardim say prayers that blend Ladino and religious music with a Middle Eastern flair. This may help explain why Rabbi Ron-Ami Meyers of the Ezra Bessaroth congregation in Seattle says he is not yet seeing much interest in Spanish citizenship.

Luis Fernando Esteban, the Spanish consul in Washington and Oregon, said they may be missing an opportunity. They might not learn about 15 centuries of Jewish history, he said, and Spain's libraries have many Jewish historical texts.

Spanish citizenship has other benefits, said Alhadeff. A Spanish passport could help travel throughout Europe and in countries that have tense relations with the U.S., said Alhadeff's son, Loren Alhadeff. It is one reason he said he's excited about the law, but he also also hopes it will reignite Sephardic pride among his generation.

Still, he noted that he has two young children, 1 and 3, and a demanding job in sales at a tech company. So he said part of his decision whether to seek Spanish citizenship will depend on the details of the process, which are not yet fully known. For instance, how hard is the language test? "I don't know if I can carve out more time to take Spanish classes right now," he said.
