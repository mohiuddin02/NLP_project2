GORDONVILLE, Pa. - Arguments over U.S. health care reform have gotten tense. They've even led to a government shutdown. But people here in rural Pennsylvania's Amish country don't worry much about all that.

The reason is very simple. Under the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, most Americans have to buy some type of health insurance. But the Amish here don't have to if they don't want to. And they have decided not to.

It's not that the Amish don't like health insurance. It's just that they insure themselves.

"We have our own health care," said a retired Amish carpenter. Like other Amish interviewed for this story, he asked that his name not be used. The Amish don't like to bring attention to themselves. "They (hospitals) give you a bill," he said. "If you can't pay it, your church will."

## Amish Community Comes Together

Most Amish are descended from 18th-century German immigrants. Around 280,000 live in close-knit communities scattered throughout the United States. The largest populations are found in rural parts of Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana.

For religious reasons, the Amish do not use cars and many other modern inventions. They also believe they should take care of themselves.

In most cases, the Amish health care system depends on church aid and benefit auctions. Local hospitals often charge Amish patients less because they pay quickly and in cash.

"The way they come together to pay for health care is amazing," said Jan Bergen, chief operating officer at Lancaster General Health. "Their sense of responsibility extends beyond themselves and to the community."

The Amish right to not be part of government programs like Obamacare dates back nearly 60 years. It grew out of their unwillingness to pay Social Security taxes.

Social Security taxes are collected by the government to provide for people after they retire. Originally, only people who worked for companies and businesses paid them. But during the 1950s, farmers and people who worked for themselves also began to be taxed. Many of the Amish refused to pay.

## Families Contribute To Hospital Aid Fund

The Amish argued that they shouldn't have to pay for government services they didn't want. In 1965, a new law gave the Amish the right to turn down Social Security, Medicaid and other government benefits. This meant they no longer had to pay taxes for them.

According to Professor Donald Kraybill, the Amish believe that "the church community should take care of its own members. If there's a disaster like a tornado, fire or hospital bill, the community should come together for that."

"We don't want government paying for our things," said an Amish man from Kinzers, Pa. "We want to pay our own way." He said that in his community nearly every family must contribute monthly to a pool of money set aside for medical bills. Big bills are paid for with what are called "free-will offerings."

The Amish stay busy with farm work and other physical labor for most of their lives. This lifestyle means that few develop diabetes and heart disease. Such problems are common among other Americans who don't get as much activity.

But Amish children are more likely than other children to have certain genetic diseases. This is due to the population's small size and because the Amish only marry other Amish.

## Bidding On Buggies And Quilts

To help with the biggest medical expenses, Amish communities often turn to benefit auctions. These are nicknamed "mud sales" after the muddy fields where they're held.

At a recent Saturday auction in Gordonville, young Amish men bid on used horse-drawn buggies. Prices reached more than $4,000. Hand-made quilts sold for several hundred dollars each.

The money raised at mud sales goes to different things. The one in Gordonville helped pay the bills for a volunteer ambulance company. A series of five held across the state each year help raise money for the Clinic for Special Children. This world-class hospital specializes in children with genetic diseases.

Many Amish at the auction said they had relied on hospital aid to pay their medical bills.

"It's not stressful," said an Amish man at the auction. "It's there when you need it."
