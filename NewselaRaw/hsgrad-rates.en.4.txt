WASHINGTON, D.C. — Students who finish all their work graduate from high school. They get a diploma. 

Some students then go to college. Others look for work. 

Many students do not graduate. They never finish high school. They drop out. 

It can be hard for those students to find work.

The U.S. government keeps track of graduation. It looks at how many students graduate from high school. 

## More Students Graduating

The government put out a new report recently.

The report looks at the 2013-2014 school year. It says how many students finished high school.

The report gives an important number. The number is called the graduation rate. It says how many students out of every 100 graduated. People want the graduation rate to go up.

The graduation rate did go up a bit. Eighty-two out of every 100 students finished high school. Only 81 out of every 100 students graduated the year before. 

## Rates For Black, Hispanic Students Rise

African-American and Hispanic students changed the most. Their graduation rates went up more than rates for white students. 

Graduation rates are different in different parts of the country. 

Iowa did the best of all the states. Around 91 out of every 100 high school students graduated. Washington, D.C., had the lowest rate. Only 61 out of every 100 students graduated.

Nebraska, New Jersey, Wisconsin, Texas, New Hampshire and Indiana did well. All were in the high 80s. Nevada and New Mexico did poorly. They were in the 60s.

The graduation rate is still much too low. Almost 1 out of every 5 students is not graduating.

## 90 Out Of 100 Students

Some people are pushing for a new goal. They want to see 90 out of every 100 students graduating. They want to reach that goal by 2020. 

It is not enough to go from 81 out of every 100 students graduating to 82, these people say. The change is not big enough. The U.S. must do better.

Still, African-American and Hispanic students are graduating more than before. The country's graduation rate has gone up. That is good.
