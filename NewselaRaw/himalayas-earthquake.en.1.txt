Earlier this year, two massive earthquakes struck in the Himalayan mountains in Nepal. The quakes destroyed thousands of buildings, killed upward of 8,500 people, and injured hundreds of thousands more. The people of Nepal are still recovering, but scientists are already worrying about the next earthquake. Specifically, there is growing concern that another powerful earthquake in Nepal could cause some of the country's dams to burst, leading to devastating floods.

More than 600 large dams have been built or are in some stage of construction or planning in the Himalayas. According to a number of engineers and scientists, many of these dams are probably not designed to withstand the worst earthquakes that could hit the region. The 2015 earthquakes cracked or damaged several hydropower projects, and the next earthquake to hit the Himalayas could be even stronger.

Should any of the dams burst, reservoirs as large as lakes could empty onto downstream towns and cities. A collapse of Tehri Dam in the central Himalayas, for instance, would release a wall of water about 650 feet high. The water would slam through two towns and the flooding would affect six cities with a combined population of 2 million.

## Pressure Grows As Earth's Crust Moves

Earthquakes plague the region because of the movement of continental plates miles below the surface. According to the theory of plate tectonics, different pieces of the earth's crust ("plates") are in slow, steady motion. The Indian subcontinent is pushing under the Tibetan Plateau at roughly 6 feet per century, but it regularly gets stuck. This leads to a build-up of pressure, until a section of the Tibetan plate lurches a few yards southward and releases the pent-up energy in an earthquake. The Himalayas are above the fault line where Indian and Tibetan plates meet, which makes the region prone to earthquakes.

Adding to the danger, the earthquakes that hit Nepal earlier this year destabilized the region to the west, notes Laurent Bollinger. He is a seismologist, a scientist who studies earthquakes, at the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission. Destabilization makes a great earthquake more likely to occur. A great earthquake is any earthquake that scores an 8.0 or higher on the Richter scale, the scale that rates the strength of earthquakes from 0 to 10. The two that hit in April and May 2015 were 7.8 and 7.3 respectively.

## Stronger Quakes Predicted

Other studies indicate that these earthquakes released only a fraction of the stress between the Indian and Tibetan plates below the Himalayas. This suggests that more quakes of equal or greater strength will hit the region in the coming years. "Whether they'll break now, in an 8, or wait another 200 years and then give way in an 8.7, one cannot say," says Vinod K. Gaur. He is a seismologist at the CSIR Fourth Paradigm Institute in Bangalore.

Given the likelihood of more earthquakes in Nepal, the dams in the region, some of which hold up walls of water as tall as 45 feet, have to be specially reinforced. They must be able to withstand the strong ground shaking of an extreme earthquake, says Martin Wieland of the International Commission on Large Dams.

Most of the dams in the region supply hydropower to India and China. They block the flow of rivers in the Himalayas and then convert the built-up energy into electricity. Although every nation has its own regulations, India and China are secretive about their dam designs. Independent engineers are only rarely allowed to examine Indian and Chinese dams. When they do, what they find is sometimes unsettling.

## Dam Design Planning Criticized

For example, Probe International, a Canadian environmental research organization, reports that designers for China's Three Gorges Dam did not consider worst-case scenarios when planning for earthquake resistance. Similarly, Tehri Dam never underwent realistic simulations, says Gaur. Scientists and engineers within the Chinese government claim that Tehri Dam can survive an 8.5 shock, but experts are not sure.

If the Indian and Chinese governments have not put in place the proper reinforcements, hundreds of dams could be in danger of bursting when the next big earthquake hits the Himalayas. If that were to happen during monsoon season, when the dams are full, the consequences could be catastrophic.

## India, China Scandals Exposed

Local corruption can complicate matters. Builders sometimes save money by using poor building materials or ignoring safety requirements. Corrupt government officials, rather than making sure builders follow the rules, sometimes accept bribes to look the other way. A 2011 study published in Nature magazine found that an overwhelming majority of deaths from building collapse in earthquakes occur in corrupt countries. What is more, Transparency International, a nongovernmental organization (NGO) that exposes corruption, identifies public construction works as one of the world's most bribery-prone industries, and singles out dams as being of special concern. Scandals involving dam projects have been exposed in both India and China.

A handful of scientists have taken the lead in arguing for safer dam construction. They have had only limited success, though.

For now, all they can do is call attention to the problem. Peter Bosshard of the environmental organization International Rivers argues that attention needs to be paid to the Himalayan dams. Keeping an eye on the Indian and Chinese dams will make it harder for those governments to cut corners.

Scientists hope that, with the help of public pressure, dams in the Himalayas will be reinforced to withstand great earthquakes. Otherwise, the next great earthquake in the area may result in a man-made tsunami.
