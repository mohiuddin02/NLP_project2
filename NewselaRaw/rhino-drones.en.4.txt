There's a lot of talk about drones lately. These aircraft fly without a pilot. Someone on the ground  controls them from another location â€“ sometimes thousands of miles away. Drones can be used in many ways. The remote-controlled planes can drop bombs, get information or watch people from the sky.

The United States has used drones to attack enemies. Many people are worried about this. These critics say that bombs from drones have killed lots of innocent people.

But one man has a new plan for drones that would help save lives. Illegal hunters shoot hundreds of rhinos every year in South Africa. Professor Tom Snitch thinks that drones could help stop the killing.

## Booming Business

The rhinoceros is very rare. Hunting a rhino is a crime called poaching. In South Africa one animal is killed every 11 hours. So far this year, poachers have killed 350 rhinos. Last year, 668 endangered rhinos were lost.

The poachers kill the huge beasts to sell their horns. They grind up the rhino horn into powder. They then sell it in parts of Asia. People there believe that rhino horn can cure certain illnesses, like cancer.

Lots of people in Asia want this powder. The poachers can sell rhino horn for a lot of money. Criminal gangs can get $30,000 for one pound of the horn powder.

## Eyes In The Sky

Professor Snitch works at the University of Maryland. He knows how to use maps and satellite information to help solve problems.

Snitch has kept his drone plans secret so he can catch the poachers by surprise. But he will start working over the next few days.

The work will take place in the huge Kruger game reserve. This big park contains lions, elephants, buffalo, leopards and rhinos. It is 220 miles wide.

Snitch will use small drones called the Falcon. These airplanes weigh 12 pounds. They can fly for about six miles. The team will use the drones to watch over the park.

They will collect data about the poachers and the rhinos. Snitch will also look at the weather and history of other shootings.

Snitch hopes he can then work out where poachers will attack next. He will send park wardens to catch the poachers and save the rhinos.

## Fight For The Future

Snitch hopes countries will use this technology to protect animals in the future. Wildlife groups also say they want to fight back against the hunters.

Carter Roberts is president of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). "We're not winning this battle," Roberts said. "The bad guys have night-vision goggles. They've got helicopters. We need to up our game to combat what we're dealing with."

## Ancient Survivor Not Dying On "Our Watch"

Rhinos are impressive beasts. Many people have worked very hard to save the rhino. It nearly died out for good 100 years ago.

Matt Lewis is an African animal expert. "We don't want to be the ones responsible for the extinction of a species that's been on Earth for millions of years," Lewis said.

"I think we should say this cannot happen on our watch. We cannot let rhinos go extinct. We cannot be the people to let that happen," Lewis continued.

Snitch and his drones could be very important in saving the rhino.
