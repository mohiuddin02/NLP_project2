LINCOLN, Neb. — When the Yazidis in Lincoln cook, they weep. They know their relatives in the Middle East have nothing to eat. When they see their beds, they think of their family members trapped on a mountaintop. They have nothing there to sleep on but rocks.

Many members of the Yazidi community in Nebraska say they have stopped eating, sleeping and going to work. Surrounded by the state's cornfields, they stare at their phones and wait for news from northern Iraq.

Iraqi Yazidis could face a genocide, meaning they could be killed in large numbers, President Barack Obama said last week. To help, the United States is dropping water and food to Yazidis in danger. The Yazidis are an ancient religious group. They fled the Islamic State (ISIL) fighters who want to control Iraq.

The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has also been called the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Levant is the English term for the region stretching from southern Turkey through Syria to Egypt.

ISIL has seized huge chunks of land in Iraq and neighboring Syria. The group has declared its own country with strict Islamic rules. Tens of thousands of Yazidis escaped to Mount Sinjar when ISIL fighters overran the city of Sinjar, the center of the Yazidi community.

## Community Feels Their Pain

Yazidis in Nebraska said some members of the community were so sad that they could not get out of bed. Others had attempted suicide. A nurse, Sharifa Khalil, 26, said more than 20 people had been hospitalized for stress-related reasons, including dehydration and fainting.

Hakima Antar, 26, sat on the floor of a crowded apartment where Yazidis had gathered. She was weeping quietly and clutching a napkin. Antar said her sister and her five children have been trapped on Mount Sinjar.

"I feel guilty when I see food or when I eat," she said through an interpreter. "I look at the food and I can't even eat, because they are hungry over there. … I can't even sleep."

The Lincoln community is thought to number in the hundreds. It is believed to be the largest community of Yazidis in the United States. Yazidis here have been flooded with videos and images of relatives and children begging for help. Horror stories have reached them from Iraq of starvation, no water and enslavement of Yazidi women.

Although the stories from Iraq cannot be confirmed, Yazidis in the United States have no doubt of their relatives' suffering. No doubt, and much fear.

## People Rely On Cellphones

Three former U.S. military interpreters gathered in a darkened living room of a Lincoln apartment. They and their wives were staying there to keep from being alone.

"If I was not here, I would kill myself," said Fares Baki, 29, who moved to the United States in December.

Baki said his brother and his brother's four children have been trapped on Mount Sinjar without food or water. The food being dropped by emergency aid groups has not reached them. The brothers have kept in touch by phone, he said, but many Yazidis say their relatives' phones are dying.

Faisal is 33 years old. He used to be a military interpreter and moved to the United States in 2012. He said one of his three sisters in Iraq was captured by ISIL militants last week. She was able to call him with a cellphone she had smuggled into a jail beneath her clothing. She wanted it to be a secret so she asked that Faisal's last name not be used.

"Before I come here, and just now, I tried, I couldn't get hold of her," Faisal said on Sunday. "Since yesterday she's been telling me that she only has one bar of battery charge left."

His sister told him ISIL fighters had separated the older women from the younger women and had taken the boys away. She saw ISIL fighters kill a pregnant Yazidi woman, he said.

"I'm just shocked and frozen — I can't even cry anymore," Faisal said.
