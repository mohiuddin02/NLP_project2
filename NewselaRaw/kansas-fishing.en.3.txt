CLARK STATE FISHING LAKE, Kan. â€” The last thing you would expect to see around Wichita, Kansas, is a fishing oasis. But that is exactly what Bluff Creek Valley is. Many Kansans call it the prettiest public fishing hole in their state.

The land around Bluff Creek Valley is steep and hard to get to. Even deer find much of the area hard to reach. The highway has sharp turns that lead cars into a valley full of tall cottonwoods and feathery willows.

Across the valley stretches 300 acres of crystal clear water.

## Hungry, Fat Fish

"These fish are so fat, their mouths always look small," said Joey Yeager, who has fished the area for many years. "I don't think I've ever seen a skinny bass in this lake."

His fishing partner is Lowell Aberson, who works for the Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism. He is a fisheries biologist. He is also hopeful about the lake's future.

The lake was made in the 1930s through a government public works program. The program gave jobs to hundreds of unemployed men. The men would work at places like Clark County to build public areas. They worked hard with limited supplies. Often, the only tools they had were mules and shovels. Their pay was little more than meals and a tent. The men moved the thousands of tons of dirt and rock needed to construct the lake's dam. More than 80 years later, the dam still holds all that water.

## Quiet Fishing Spot To Relax

The lake is full of many fish and has a good population of white bass, walleye and catfish.

Yeager is a 31-year-old, experienced fisherman. He makes the 90-minute drive to Bluff Creek Valley mostly to catch largemouth bass.

He has high expectations when he fishes here. He said that he expects to catch a 5-pound fish every time he comes. On a recent day, Yeager and Aberson headed out for a fishing trip together. They steered the boat to a cove on the lake's western shoreline.

The first bass of the day was a chunky fish weighing nearly 2 pounds. Then Yeager and Aberson started flipping plastic lizards and crawdads into flooded vegetation. That's when things began to happen. Fish were attracted to their lures. Yeager soon jerked several bass aboard, each weighing about a pound.

Yeager spends a lot of time fishing in the bays and coves in the lake. Fishermen can usually find a spot out of the wind on the lake. A quiet spot can be a good place to look for fish. The water is smooth and quiet in the coves.

## Lake Has Natural Beauty

Yeager always leaves the lake feeling happy. Though the fishing at Clark left him a bit disappointed that day, he is never let down by the experience and natural beauty.

In between casts of his fishing line, Yeager stopped to look at the nature around him. He watched a kingfisher fly across the water. He saw a whitetail doe at the back of a cove. He gazed at the hills and high bluffs that rise well above the lake. He pointed toward several stems poking through the lake's surface that will become lily pads soon, with pink flowers.

"They'll be gorgeous. The entire lake is gorgeous," Yeager said. "This is the kind of lake where it's just good to be out here. It's all just good for me when I'm here."
