CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Little things can bring big changes. Justice Crawford and Nathaniel Nitkin are learning this with music. A cello and a violin brought big changes to their lives.

Justice and Nathaniel are in sixth grade. They go to a middle school for music in the city of Charlotte. Before, they used to go to Winterfield Elementary School. Winterfield has a special music program. The Charlotte Symphony Orchestra (CSO) teaches students how to play musical instruments.

The CSO taught Justice to play the violin. Nathaniel learned to play the violin and the cello. They are the first students from the program to go to the music school.

## Music Class Helps Kids In Other Ways

The CSO wants to help kids learn about music. Most of these kids come from poor families. Their families would not be able to pay for music lessons. The CSO hopes the music program helps students. They want to teach students to stay out of trouble. They hope the kids can get better grades.

The program helped Justice and Nathaniel. They got into a good middle school.

Endora Crawford is Justice's mom. She said she is very happy that he likes the CSO program. He is good at playing music.

Neil Nitkin is Nathaniel's dad. He said that the music helps Nathaniel focus. He said, "It makes a big difference."

## Students Work Together And Practice

The program was started to teach students about music. It teaches other important things, too. Students are allowed to take some instruments home to practice. This teaches them to take care of things.

In the program, students work together. They spend time with children they might not know outside of the program. The students also have to practice. When students practice, they get better. 

Justice and Nathaniel had never played music before Winterfield. The first year is to explore. Students can play any instrument. Justice liked the clarinet his first year. Later, he decided to play the violin. Nathaniel liked the trumpet at first. He picked the cello and violin.

Nathaniel said that it looked easy when he started. He knew it would get tougher. Now, Nathaniel said, "Practicing is pleasure." He practices every day.
