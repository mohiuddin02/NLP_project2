CHICAGO â€” Better schools may lead to healthier kids, according to a new study.

A team of researchers found that low-income teens at good schools made better health choices. The study was published Monday.

The researchers looked at 1,000 kids in grades 10 through 12. Some of the students went to excellent schools. Others went to schools that weren't so good. Other than that, the teens were similar in many ways. Most of them were Hispanic and lived in poor neighborhoods in Los Angeles.

The researchers found that kids at the good schools made better choices. They were less likely to make bad health choices. These bad health choices included heavy use of alcohol and drugs.

## Some Students Did Not Participate

The study doesn't prove that the schools made the difference. The results aren't completely reliable since many students refused to answer questions. Still, Dr. Michael Wong said the study seems to show that "better education will lead to better health." Wong wrote the study. He is a medical doctor and researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles.

The study involved mostly Hispanic students. They applied to one of three top schools in Los Angeles from 2007 to 2010. About half of the kids had parents who did not graduate from high school. Most of their families didn't own their own homes.

Teens were asked to answer questions about their behavior. They were able to answer in private. This improved the chances they would answer honestly.

The three top schools selected the pupils at random. Students weren't chosen based on their grades or test scores. The schools basically picked names out of a hat.

Most of the kids who got into the good schools attended them. Most of the other students went to schools that were not as good. After their first year, the kids at the good schools did better than those at the poor ones. Their math and English test scores were higher. Also, only about 1 in 10 kids at the better schools dropped out. At the worse schools, about 1 in 4 dropped out.

## Good Health And Good Grades Are Important

Professor Harold Pollack is a health researcher at the University of Chicago. He called the study important. He said it showed the need to create "a much larger number of schools that serve kids well."

Doing well in school is important for their long-term health. Getting good grades is even more important than making good choices, he said.

Doing well in school is "just so critical for people's well-being," he said.
