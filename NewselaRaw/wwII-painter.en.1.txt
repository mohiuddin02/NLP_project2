PALM SPRINGS, Calif. — A man in a red and black kilt sat in the shadow of a Supermarine Spitfire and painted inside an air-conditioned hangar in the Sonoran Desert.

Midmorning, visitors to the Palm Springs Air Museum shuffled past shined-up war relics. They peered into cockpits or got lost staring across the big, bright box of a room. Distracted by wings or tail fins, they tended not to notice Chris Demarest until they nearly bumped into him and his long table of paint vials, water jugs and solvent cans.

He looked into his canvas, very closely, while a small, folded, black-and-white photocopy of a portrait sat next to him. As he glanced over at it, he painted light brown streaks that would form the beginning of a face.

Behind him was an entire wall of 70 portraits — young servicemen and women in coveralls or pilot uniforms, leaning against planes, embracing or hard at work.

As Demarest talked about his work, a museum volunteer stopped to join him.

"This — this is really important," the man said.

## Every Picture Really Does Tell A Story

For the last two years, Demarest has traveled the country from library to museum to retirement home, displaying his intimate portraits of World War II veterans in their prime.

Veterans and their families circulate through the big room, stopping to chat. They bring him black-and-white photos, photocopied portraits or plastic scrapbooks to share, little frozen-frame moments that, for many, contain the biggest stories of their lives.

"They all still think of themselves as being 18 or 19 years old," Demarest said.

He can't do all the veterans' portraits, but he takes as many of their offerings as he can handle and reconstructs them in full color on canvas. Each of his portraits is accompanied by a neat, typewritten story beneath it.

Some of the subjects are famous — like Hazel Ying Lee, one of the first Chinese-American female pilots — but most are not. They are the anonymous faces of war — men swept up from small towns or women working the home-front factories.

## One Veteran's Long Road

Men like George Edwards, a 94-year-old veteran who knows what it means to fight.

Sometimes it takes grit, like the battle in Italy that fractured his spine. Sometimes it takes discipline, like the march across the Arizona desert in training camp.

And sometimes it takes creativity, like some well-placed roofing nails in a hand-to-hand fight.

Edwards learned these lessons quickly as a black man in a country, an army and a time that made him fight for nearly everything.

As an officer of the 92nd Infantry Division, the Buffalo Soldiers of World War II, Edwards led platoons through Italy — the Alps, the Apennines and the Po Valley. His Purple Heart was pinned to his baseball cap as he sat in the library of the Air Museum and remembered.

In some ways, combat was an escape from home for Edwards and the men of the 92nd. Italy was a place where even the countesses spoke to soldiers and where GIs congratulated themselves on saving the pope.

Edwards gestured to Demarest's portrait propped up next to him. He is young, lithe, natty in his uniform, with his wife, her hair up, leaning into him.

"Coming from slavery to freedom, you've got to fight for things," he said. "The biggest thing is you've got to demand respect."

## His Art Took A New Direction

For most of his career, Demarest, who at 63 has a friendly chuckle and a trim beard, was a children's book author and illustrator, and then an official artist with the Coast Guard. A few years ago, after illustrating best-sellers and embedding with rescue swimmers and helicopter pilots, Demarest saw book sales start to slow.

Around that time, he painted his first portrait of a World War II veteran, the father of a neighbor. The portrait was adapted from a black-and-white photo in which the man, 19 at the time, casually leans against the wing of a plane. Demarest saw echoes of his own dad — a wartime pilot himself — and painted the portrait for the man's 88th birthday.

"My neighbor said, 'My dad, I've never seen him cry before, but when I gave him that painting, he teared up,'" Demarest said.

With that, he knew he had his next subject.

A divorced dad with a son in college, he took the project on the road. He sold his house in New Hampshire and all his furniture. For the last two years, he has funded his exhibits out of his own pocket with only the occasional small payment from a museum or library.

## Life Captured On Canvas

Demarest knows he has limited time to engage with his subjects. As the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II approaches, most of the war's veterans are in their last years.

Even with all his success on the battlefield, some fights George Edwards just couldn't win.

Gazing longer at Demarest's portrait, Edwards didn't talk about himself. He looked only at his wife.

"This means a hell of a lot," he said. "She's been dead 62 years."

Complications from a blood disorder led to her death during childbirth. The following year, doctors began prescribing a treatment that might have saved her.

"She missed it by one year," he said. Never remarried, he raised four daughters and a son — who died at age 12 — by himself.

Demarest remembers giving Edwards the painting. The stoic soldier put his head in his hands and cried. Even today, Edwards sees his reflection in the canvas.

"It's my whole damn life. It's my whole history. You see how young I was?"

Edwards refocuses on the paint, and his eyes brighten. He's 25 again, on the front lines, ready for a fight.
