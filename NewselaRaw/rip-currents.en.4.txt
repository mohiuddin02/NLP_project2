They were there to test a new way of studying the biggest killer of beach swimmers: rip currents.

Water piles up between the beach and a line of raised sand in the ocean.

Then the water finds a low point in the line of sand and rushes back out to sea. Sometimes swimmers are carried along with the flow. The current pushes them into deeper water.

While studying the riptides, the scientists dragged yellow-and-green objects into the waves. The plastic and foam devices are known as "drifters." They are called drifters because they drift into the ocean and back to the shore with the waves.

The scientists then walked along the beach to wherever the drifters washed up on the beach. Once scientists found them, they scooped them up.

Rip currents have killed 62 beachgoers in North Carolina since 1999. They are the most common cause of people drowning in the ocean.

## Scary For Swimmers

Simon Sanders is in charge of ocean rescues at Carolina Beach. A rip current is "really frightening for swimmers," he said. The swimmers must keep swimming and swimming. They aren't able to stop.

Scientists have been learning more about riptides recently. The 22 drifters released Wednesday were big news. They are thought to be the first ever used on the East Coast of the United States.

Drifters float along like swimmers. Scientists carefully track where the rip currents take them.

On Wednesday, the group chose its spot on the beach for a reason. The scientists set up right where a rip current had been reported.

The rip current clearly was happening. A dark patch of water showed where the current split the waves on its way out to sea. The current was weak, though. Several swimmers bobbed cheerfully right in the middle of it.

## Planning An Escape

Rip currents can be unpredictable.

The currents develop constantly. However, one particular beach may develop them only rarely. Dangerously strong ones may be seen less than 10 days a year at any one beach.

Spencer Rogers led the construction of the drifters used on Wednesday. Currents, he said, are "almost never dangerous." When they are, though, watch out: Even Michael Phelps, the Olympic champion swimmer, wouldn't be able to "keep up with one."

The new studies aren't just about understanding how rip currents work. They also could change what swimmers are told about escaping them.

One of the volunteers on Wednesday was a well-known scientist himself. Named Ron Brander, he was visiting from Australia.

Brander is an expert on how currents behave. In his opinion, what people are told about escaping rip currents is wrong.

## Swim Near A Lifeguard!

Swimmers are told to swim alongside, or parallel to, the beach, instead of heading straight for shore. They are supposed to keep swimming until they are out of the current.

Brander said that in many cases rip currents form circles of water. Called eddies, these can return you to the beach. All you have to do is stay calm and float along with the flow.

Experts are now deciding whether or not to change the advice given swimmers. Some feel people should still be told to swim parallel to shore. Others feel they should be told to float and wait.

The "float and wait" approach does have its dangers. In a handful of cases, swimmers would be forced into deeper water.

No one knows right now if the experts' advice will change.

Meanwhile, beachgoers should keep a simple tip in mind: If you spot a rip current, play it safe. Swim near a lifeguard or don't go in the water past your knees.
