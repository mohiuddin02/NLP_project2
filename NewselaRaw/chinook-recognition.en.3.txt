SEATTLE â€” The Chinook Native American tribes greeted Lewis and Clark when the explorers arrived at the Lower Columbia River in 1805. The explorers were the first Americans to travel into what is now the western United States. While they were traveling, the Chinook tribes helped members of the expedition through the winter. The tribes brought them food and helped them navigate.

It has been more than 200 years since that first contact. The five tribes that now make up the Chinook Indian Nation have a constitution, a tribal council and annual meetings. They are not, however, recognized by the U.S. government.

The government claims the tribes died out, said Chinook Councilwoman Kate Elliot. "But my family still lives on our (ancestral) land."

The Chinooks may gain recognition under a proposal to change how Indian tribes are officially recognized. The new process was announced May 22. It is part of an effort to make tribal recognition more organized and transparent, according to the U.S. Department of the Interior.

## Gaps In Written Records

Right now, tribes have to prove they have continuously existed through history. This is not easy for the tribes. Many of them have gaps in their written records.

The changes would set the 1930s as the earliest date that tribes must give proof of their existence. Some tribes that have been turned down have also been allowed apply again. In the past, this was not allowed.

Federal recognition is useful for tribes. Recognized tribes may receive money from the government. They also get services such as health care, according to the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). A federally recognized tribe is considered an independent nation. It has a government-to-government relationship with the United States. It also has the right to create and enforce laws, govern its territory and decide who may be a member.

For some Washington tribes, the proposed changes could make federal recognition easier. These tribes, however, admit that they still have a long road ahead.

"We are pleased by the proposed changes. However, we know that there is still a ways to go in the process," said Sue Hall. She is one of the heads of the Snohomish Tribe of Indians. The Snohomish have fought for more than 30 years to be recognized.

## Recognized, Then Not, Wait What?

The Chinooks and the Seattle-area Duwamish Tribe received federal recognition in 2001. That was during the very end of the administration of President Bill Clinton. But their recognition was quickly reversed by President George W. Bush's administration.

Bush's administration said there was a period of time when the Duwamish did not have a tribal government. Also, they said the Duwamish and Chinook communities had not existed continuously through history. That means that they couldn't show that the modern-day tribal members were descendants of the historic Duwamish and Chinook tribes.

One proposed change is known as the "Part 83 process." It makes tribes keep track of their existence as a tribe only from 1934. The law now requires them to show that they have existed continuously from "historical times."

This could be helpful to the Chinooks. That nation has documentation from the modern era that goes beyond its oral history, Elliott said. She said the change will help "level the playing field" for all tribes seeking recognition.

"You can't expect the tribes whose treaties weren't honored to get paperwork," Elliott said. Finding records from the late 1800s to the 1930s is difficult, she said. During that time, the U.S. government forcibly removed Indian children from their families. The children were put in boarding schools. The idea was to strip them of their Indian culture and "civilize" them.

"How can you tell people you can't do anything Indian," she said. "But later, when you go to file, they have to prove from 1851 or 1855 that they have been keeping documents?"

## Hearings On The Matter

The current rule forces tribes to relive the more "difficult times in their history," said Michael Willis. He is a lawyer. He focuses on legal issues affecting [Native Americans](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Native+American).

"But if there is one thing we are, we are stubborn, which is the reason we are still here," Elliott said. "We are not giving up."

Duwamish Tribe Chairwoman Cecile Hansen said the proposed changes still don't take away from the tribe's goal. It is seeking the recognition they won and lost in 2001.

"No Indian person in the United States should have to prove who they are," Hansen said. "I have been doing this for 39 years. Why should I have to go through another set of regulations?"

The BIA will hold hearings in July. Recognized tribes and the public may comment on the proposed changes.
