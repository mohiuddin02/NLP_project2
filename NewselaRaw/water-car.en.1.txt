Dave March takes a sip of his coffee as he looks through the windshield of his car. His car wasn't idling on a road, but in the water in Newport Harbor, Calif., next to his 65-foot yacht.

"This has been a dream for 10, 15 years," he said, his gaze fixed toward Catalina, where he'd been trying to take his car across the water. "Every time I see that island, I think, 'Oh, it's not that far.'"

March, 58, has spent more than 10 years developing the high-speed car that drives on the water. And he is about to take it to market for $135,000 apiece. He has already taken deposits from the Prince of Dubai, tycoons in Silicon Valley, and wealthy people from around the world.

On this day, he hopes to prove the car really is amphibious, which means it can drive on water. He plans to drive it from his WaterCar headquarters in Fountain Valley, Calif., to Catalina Island.

But he has never tested the car on open water, and 30 miles is a long way to swim.

## Python And Panther Models

For years, March has been building and testing amphibious cars, or amphibians. He filed licenses for his first amphibian in 2003. Six years later, he set the Guinness World Record for fastest amphibious car with the Python, which has a 450-horsepower Corvette engine and can hit 60 miles per hour (mph) on the water.

The car that March is test-driving to Catalina is the Panther, a smaller, off-road amphibian. It took him 12 years of trial and error and hundreds of thousands of dollars in research and development to create it.

He posted a video online of the Panther driving on the freeway and scaling sand dunes at a lake. March's phone hasn't stopped ringing. The car already has been filmed in three television shows, including the current season of "The Bachelor."

The United Arab Emirates has ordered one, and Sheik Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum, the crown Prince of Dubai, has ordered six. Two of the most powerful men in Silicon Valley each have sent deposits. NASCAR drivers are knocking at his door.

Back in Newport Harbor, March points his Panther toward the horizon. Surrounded by three powerboats carrying friends and family, he steps on the gas, and the Panther slowly rises up out of the water. As he passes the other boats, he waves to his family, fingers crossed. The morning sun is still low, and the water is like undulating glass as the Panther cuts across it.

## Dolphins And A Whale

As March moves into deeper water and the shore disappears from view, dolphins leap up around him and a whale comes up for air. You can see March's big grin from the deck of his yacht.

"We're at 13.5 miles," March's partner, Fred Selby, radios from his boat before the halfway mark. "This is the point of no return."

Strong and gnarled from years of working with fiberglass and steel, March's hands are like those of a carpenter. His messy blond hair falls on either side of his gray-blue eyes. He has the confident smile of a man who can afford expensive toys.

Like so many other ideas, March's first water car was born in his basement, which he flooded to see whether his test model would float. But the real challenge of making a car that can operate on the water wasn't waterproofing, as you'd think. It was getting the car up and out of the water when he pressed the gas.

March's first model in 2003 looked like a small Camaro sports car. When it was switched to a boat, the tires retracted and metal plates covered the wheel wells. March posted a video of it online, and the clip went viral.

WaterCar's first customer, an electronics manufacturer from Pennsylvania named Peter McIlroy, is scheduled to receive his Panther sometime in February. March said it's taking longer than usual to produce. McIlroy wants his Panther to be gunmetal gray with a red interior, to match his Bentley.

## "You Learn Something"

Catalina Island was a foggy blur Saturday morning when March idled into the harbor.

An hour and 10 minutes later, he'd made it to Avalon Bay. "I never thought we'd make it the first time out," March said as he stood in the back of his yacht and celebrated with his friends and family.

Ten years earlier, the adventurer Sir Richard Branson broke the Guinness World Record for the fastest crossing of the English Channel in an amphibious car. The Panther cut Branson's time in half.

After the thrill of crossing the ocean wore off, March wanted to drive the Panther into town. But the tide had complicated a land approach. The Panther is designed for cement loading docks and relatively smooth shores like a sandy beach, not the steep, rock-strewn banks of Catalina at low tide.

March drove onto shore, but it was too steep and he had to reverse the jets. It sent a barrage of small rocks up into the car's underbelly, damaging a wheel fastener.

March was visibly upset that he was not able to finish the Panther's maiden voyage to Catalina, but was glad to find a weak link to improve upon. "Each time you break something, you learn something," March said. "That's what it's all about."
