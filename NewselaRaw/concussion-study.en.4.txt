Concussions are slight brain injuries that come from getting hit in the head. If they happen a lot, they can cause serious problems.

Recently, many people have become worried about [concussions](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=concussions) in children. In particular, they worry about children who play football or hockey.

On Wednesday, the White House announced several new efforts to fight concussions. The goal is to prevent and treat concussions in children.

Officials announced that $65 million had been raised.

The National College Athletic Association (NCAA) pledged $30 million of that total. The NCAA helps to regulate college sports. Another $25 million came from the National Football League (NFL). A further $10 million was a gift from Steve Tisch, who is co-owner of the New York Giants football team.

## Programs Can Be Made Better

Tisch's contribution has a particular purpose. It will help get a national tracking system for concussions off the ground.

"Hopefully, 20 years from today, athletes won't be discovering" brain damage, said Tisch. "This is kind of a new frontier."

The program Tisch donated to was founded in 2012. So far, it has treated 600 young patients. It has also studied the effects of concussions on student athletes. With the money from Tisch, it can do more.

Now, said Dr. Christopher Giza, the program will reach more students. It will be able to improve treatment. It will also allow scientists to learn more about the longer-term effects of concussion.

## Even The President Has Safety Concerns

Earlier studies have shown that concussions can cause serious problems. Children with concussions can have trouble learning. They also can become angry, sad or confused. This has made parents uncomfortable about allowing their children to play several sports.

President Barack Obama understands that concern. If he had a son, he said in 2013, he would not let him play pro football.

Still, the Obamas take a strong interest in sports. Indeed, one of their goals is to get children moving and doing more exercise. To help make sports as safe as possible, the president would like to see more done about concussions.

Some scientists believe that the young brain recovers more quickly from bumps than a grownup's brain does. Others fear the opposite: A young brain is still developing, they say. For that reason, repeated blows may be more damaging. Young brains do not have the protective coating seen in older brains.

## Taking Hits Seriously

Either way, experts say, coaches should follow certain guidelines: A child who has been hit hard in the head should be pulled from a game. He or she must not be allowed to return before being examined by a doctor. And safety rules should be strictly followed. For instance, head-to-head butts in football should not be allowed.

Other new efforts to fight concussions include the following:

—The NCAA will spend $30 million on a study of concussions. One goal will be to change the way people think. For many athletes, blows to the head are seen as no big deal. They are just dings to be "shaken off."

—The NFL will spend $25 million on making youth sports safer. It will increase the number of athletic trainers in schools. It will also educate parents about sports safety.

—And $5 million will be spent on improving helmets. The new helmets will use advanced materials. Scientists hope they will provide better protection against concussion.
