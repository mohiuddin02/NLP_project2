WASHINGTON â€” Ahmed Abdulateef is a young musician. He plays the oud, a Middle Eastern instrument like a guitar.

In Abdulateef's hometown, musicians and other artists are not safe. They are sometimes attacked by violent men. In Iraq, where Abulateef is from, there are some people who are very strict Muslims. They do not want to allow some art or music.

Abdulateef was threatened. He had a gun put to his head. His father smashed his guitar and kicked him out of the house.

He played music in secret for a while. Then he got the chance to travel. He discovered the United States had a program where musicians from different countries could perform. Abdulateef applied. He was chosen. He got to travel to the United States for one month to perform in California and other states.

## Just Walking Freely

In the United States, Abdulateef was free to walk down the street with his oud over his shoulder. He was free to make music, to be himself.

"Here, for the first time, I'm Ahmed," he said.

Abdulateef loved his new freedom. He wanted to stay in the United States longer. To do this, he applied for asylum on Nov. 24.

Asylum is a system for people who are not safe in their own country. These people may face danger for political or religious reasons. They can ask another country to stay there. If that country accepts, they can live there in safety.

Many other Iraqis have also applied for asylum in the United States. They have to wait a long time for a decision. It can take months, even years.

There are many people escaping violence in the Middle East and the United States cannot handle them all.

## Fighting For "A Whole New Life"

"I don't have a plan B," Abdulateef said. "This is a new life, a whole new life, and it's worth fighting to stay here."

David Garfield is an immigration lawyer in Washington, D.C. He decided to help Abdulateef for free. Garfield says Abdulateef has a strong case for asylum. Still, that is not enough for a quick decision from the government, Garfield said.

He is also helping other Iraqis with strong cases. There are female doctors who have been threatened. There is a man who faces violence because he converted to Christianity.

Those Iraqis have already waited nearly a year. They still do not know what their futures will be.

"It looks like they're just sitting on the Iraqi cases," Garfield said. "All these letters, they just don't get responded to. There's been no decisions."

The U.S. government says 1,133 Iraqis applied for asylum in 2014. Only 788 applied the year before. Part of the rise could be because of the violent Islamic State. The Islamic State is a terror group in Iraq and Syria. It wants to set up its own country under strict Islamic law. It is also known as ISIS or ISIL.

## Respect For Freedom

Abdulateef said he was not thinking of asylum when he first came to the United States. He learned about it from American friends. They sent him to Garfield, the immigration attorney.

Part of Abdulateef's application for asylum was an affidavit: a document where he tells his story. His story is special, but it is similar to the stories of many other Iraqis. They also want to live in a country where their freedoms are protected.

"All I want is to be safe from fear and be able to continue my musical career," Abdulateef's affidavit says.
