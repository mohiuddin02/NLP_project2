PORTLAND, Ore. — Military helicopters ferry search and rescue teams over the Pacific Northwest. Below lies disaster from a giant earthquake that could strike at any time.

Tidal waves called tsunamis cover cities on the coast. Buildings, bridges and roads are in ruins. Fires burn out of control. Survivors stand on rooftops, cling to floating debris or are trapped inside wrecked buildings.

Scientists are worried about the possibility of scenes like these. They say a great crack in a 650-mile-long offshore fault could open. It goes from Northern California to Canada. No one knows if or when it will happen. However, scientists say it might. Emergency officials are busy preparing for the worst.

## The "Big One" Could Happen

Federal, state and military agencies are working together for when the "Big One" happens. More than 14,000 people could die and those injured could reach 30,000\. Thousands would be left homeless. Businesses and jobs could be lost for years.

The planners would use civilian and military people and equipment to respond to the greatest natural disaster that has occurred in the U.S.

"The response will be greater than that for Hurricane Katrina or Super Storm Sandy," said Lt. Col. Clayton Braun of the Washington State Army National Guard.

Since 2013, Braun has led a team working on a military response plan for Washington state. The plan would use all government agencies.

## Thousands Of Helpers Would Be Needed

The plan would include cargo planes, helicopters and ships. Thousands of soldiers, police officers, firefighters, engineers and medical workers would be called in.

Oregon also has a response plan, called the Cascadia Playbook. It's named after the offshore fault. "That playbook is never more than 100 feet from where I am," said Andrew Phelps, head of the Oregon Office of Emergency Management. When he goes out to dinner, he keeps the playbook in his car.

A measured 9.0 earthquake and tsunami destroyed parts of Japan in 2011\. The same thing can happen in the Pacific Northwest. Scientists made an estimate for the next 50 years. They say there is a 10 to 14 percent chance it could hit the Pacific Northwest in that time. That equals about a 1-in-10 or 1-in-7 chance of happening.

Phelps said that the Japanese quake made everybody start thinking about planning for disasters. While it is impossible to fully prepare for an earthquake, planners are making progress.

The plans call for large cargo planes to land at large airports with workers and supplies. Smaller airplanes would bring help to smaller airfields near the disaster areas.

## Ships Would Move Supplies, People

Helicopters would be used in towns on the coast because roads and bridges would have been destroyed. Ships would also be needed to bring emergency supplies, help the injured and move the homeless.

Emergency hospitals would be set up because those on the coast probably would be too damaged to use. Hotels, college dorms, and sports arenas would be used as temporary shelters.

Base camps would be set up for emergency workers from across the country. There would be centers for supplies such as water, food, tents, blankets and medicine.

Clean water systems and emergency communication would be brought in.

## Buildings, Bridges Could Collapse

Seattle, Portland and other cities could face great damage. Older buildings would collapse. City search and rescue teams would be sent to look for survivors in the ruins of destroyed buildings.

Engineers would be sent in to begin repairing roads and bridges. People say more than 1,000 bridges in Oregon and Washington state could be damaged.

Coastal highways like U.S. Route 101 would be closed in some areas. Interstate 5, an important highway, would have large cracks in the road.

Phelps said he has learned to live with the threat. Still, he said, "it's a little unsettling to know that in five minutes I might have to grab that playbook and call the governor."
