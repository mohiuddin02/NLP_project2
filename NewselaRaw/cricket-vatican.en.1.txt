VATICAN CITY — On Tuesday, the Vatican served tea and cucumber sandwiches. The purpose of the gathering was not to discuss religious matters, however. Instead, it was to announce the launching of the Vatican's first-ever cricket club.

No, [Pope Francis](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=pope) isn't taking up the sport long associated with manicured grounds and English nobility. The soccer-mad "slum pope" still prefers the lower-brow sport of his beloved San Lorenzo club.

But he and the Vatican, which is the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church, have long championed sports as good for mind, body and soul. The cricket club is the Vatican's latest attempt to use sports to engage in dialogue with the contemporary world.

Australia's ambassador to the Holy See, John McCarthy, first came up with the idea. He said he hopes the St. Peter's Cricket Club will field a team to play the Church of England sometime next fall.

## An Interfaith Pitch

McCarthy said the aim of the club is to boost interfaith dialogue. Cricket is immensely popular in largely non-Catholic India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. It would, he said, be a "very special occasion" if one day seminarians from Rome's pontifical universities were to play students at Muslim or Hindu religious schools on the subcontinent.

And, McCarthy added, he had another reason for suggesting a cricket club: He wanted to educate Italy, the Vatican and even Pope Francis that there is a sport other than soccer. With that off his chest, he got busy passing around cucumber sandwiches, long the standard snack at cricket matches.

The club is expected to draw its players from a pool of 250 to 300 students and priests at the Vatican and various pontifical universities around Rome. These men are all already playing on informal teams. The new all-star Vatican team will be fielded as early as the spring.

Rome's Capannelle Cricket Club is letting the Vatican use its pitch. Donors will cover the cost of equipment, McCarthy said, as well as organizational and other related expenses.

## Vatican Versus Church Of England

Adam Chadwick, curator of collections at Lord's Cricket Ground in London, which prides itself as the home of the sport, welcomed the new Vatican club. What's more, he seemed open to a Vatican–Church of England match played on one of its pitches in the upscale St. John's Wood section of the capital.

In a phone interview, Chadwick acknowledged that the popular image of cricket is of men in white playing on country estates, with ideas of chivalry and gentlemanly behavior dictating their play. This image, he said, dates from the Victorian era of the late 19th century. In reality, he asserted, cricket's origins are very different and far more popular.

"The first mentions that we found in this country" describe "an ordinary man" playing on Sunday, when he would have been at church. "Which is a bit ironic, actually," he said with a laugh.

Cricket's enormous appeal in places like India, once part of the British Empire, is actually much more in line with the game's more popular origins, he said.

## A Sporting Church

Indeed, in keeping with Pope Francis' aim for the church to reach out to the poorest, the Vatican made clear that its cricket club wasn't thinking of English high society. Rather, it had in mind the sport's appeal with the masses.

"This represents the desire of the council to be in the peripheries, the outskirts of the world," said Monsignor Melchor Sanchez de Toca, who runs the sports department in the Vatican's culture ministry.

The Vatican already has its "Clericus Cup" soccer tournament. This pitches the Swiss Guards against seminarians from the North American College and other teams.

And just on Sunday, the culture ministry organized a "Race of Faith." A 100-meter (328-foot) track was laid down along the main boulevard leading to St. Peter's Square to emphasize the spiritual and educational values of sports.
