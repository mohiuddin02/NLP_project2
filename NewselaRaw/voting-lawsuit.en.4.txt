WASHINGTON - The U.S. Justice Department sued North Carolina on Monday over a new state voting law. The law says people have to show a state ID with a photo before they can vote. It also limits early voting.

North Carolina passed the law in August. Attorney General Eric Holder says the law is not fair to black people and other minorities. Holder is the government's top lawyer.

President Barack Obama is a Democrat. Holder works for him. This is the second time in less than two months that Holder's lawyers have sued a Republican-led state over a voting law. They challenged a voter-ID law in Texas in August.

Holder said the North Carolina law places several "troubling" new rules on voters. It would cut the number of early voting days. People would not be able to sign up to vote and cast their ballot on the same day during early voting. And the law has a tough new photo-identification rule.

## Law Aims To Block Some Voters, Holder Says

The law was meant to make fewer people vote, he said. The result will be fewer people getting to vote based on their race, Holder said.

Several Republican-governed states have passed new voting laws. Republicans argue that the changes are needed. They stop cheating, Republicans say. Democrats do not think so. The laws are meant to make it harder for blacks and other people to vote. Those people would probably vote for Democratic candidates.

Holder said his department could file more lawsuits about voting laws. "I fear that it will not be our last," he added.

The U.S. Supreme Court in June threw out part of the 1965 U.S. Voting Rights Act. The U.S. government had previously used the law to challenge state voting rules.

Republican Pat McCrory is North Carolina's Governor. He said in August that people needed a photo ID to get on an airplane. They even need it to buy cold medicine. "We should expect nothing less for the protection of our right to vote," he added.

## N.C. Governor Blasts Lawsuit

On Monday, McCrory blasted the lawsuit. He said North Carolina was doing what most of the country wanted with the law. The Justice Department was taking the position of only a few people.

North Carolina was already being sued over the law. Civil rights groups filed suit immediately after it was signed in August. Democratic U.S. Senator Kay Hagan of North Carolina also asked Holder to review the matter.

U.S. elections generally are held on Tuesdays. North Carolina allows people to vote early. Some other states do, too. It makes it more convenient to vote.

When early voting is cut short, it is worse for minorities, or non-whites, Holder said. Most blacks voted early in the past two presidential elections in North Carolina, the Justice Department said.

The department's suit asks the court to block four parts of the North Carolina law. Those are:

*   -- cutting early voting from 17 to 10 days. The overall number of early voting hours remains unchanged;

*   -- the elimination of same-day voter signup during early voting;

*   -- the rule that says you can't count certain ballots. Voters fill out those ballots when there are questions about whether they can actually vote;

*   -- the voter ID rule.

## Feds Have To Prove Discrimination

Changes in voting laws can affect the number of people who vote. That can change the results of close elections. Civil rights supporters say recent changes remind them of the earlier fight to win voting rights for blacks in the U.S. South.

The federal government will have to prove two things to win the lawsuit. It will have to show that North Carolina meant to treat voters unfairly because of their race. It will also have to show that this discrimination actually happened.

Requiring voters to have a state ID has been a major issue. The Justice Department has approved rules in some states. Those states take steps to make sure that IDs are available at little to no cost. But it has opposed the rules in states where it said the rule would be hard on the poor and minorities.

The case was assigned to a federal judge in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.
