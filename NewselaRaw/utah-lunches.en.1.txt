SALT LAKE CITY â€” Recently, Utah's Uintah Elementary has come under fire for a disturbing incident: Last week, some 40 students whose parents were behind in payments to the [school lunch program](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=school+lunch) had their $2 school lunches taken away.

Now, the Salt Lake City school district is vowing to make systemic changes to ensure it never happens again.

On Tuesday, child nutrition department director Kelly Orton delivered a brief report to the Salt Lake City school board. He blamed the incident on violations of agency procedure and a failure to notify parents that their children's lunch accounts were empty or in the negative.

"We took food trays away and embarrassed students, and for that I am sorry," Orton's report says. "No child will have their meal tray taken away ever again."

## Incident Angers Parents

To avoid that happening again, Orton said, new communication guidelines have been created for kitchen managers. The district also plans to notify parents when their account is at $10, when it's empty, and then every day after as it accumulates a negative balance.

The incident occurred on Jan. 28 when students trying to buy lunch had their meals thrown away, angering parents and stirring outrage around the country. The district put a cafeteria manager and a district supervisor on paid leave as the investigation got underway last week.

The report didn't indicate whose decision it was to toss the lunches.

The children who had their meals thrown out were given milk and fruit, a standard practice when students don't have lunch money.

Several dozen parents attended the meeting, and some said the report was vague and that the cafeteria worker put on leave was being unfairly blamed, The Salt Lake Tribune reported.

Some parents urged district leaders to hold Orton and his staff accountable.

"The lunchroom staff should not be held accountable for the policies implemented by their supervisors," said Lynn Lonardo, who said her daughter's lunch was confiscated last week.

## Workers Not Identified

But Heather Bennett, board vice president, said the move was not disciplinary.

District Superintendent McKell Withers said the leave is typical during investigations and was meant to protect the affected workers from threats. Several threatening phone calls were made to the school following the incident, but police determined they did not represent any real danger, Salt Lake City School District spokesman Jason Olsen said. School officials cited privacy concerns in not identifying the two workers on leave.

Bennett and other board members said they were as upset as the parents who attended the meeting.

"We share your real horror at the specific happening that's brought us here," she said.

Under board member questioning, Orton said his department didn't properly tell parents about a new electronic payment system, and he promised efforts to prevent meals from being tossed again. He said the investigation was ongoing and his report wasn't final.

## Won't Happen Again, Official Says

Many parents were unaware that the lunch program's new electronic system makes it harder to set up email alerts about balances, Orton said. While the new system is more cost-efficient and faster, it doesn't automatically send out messages like the old system did. Thus parents now have to try harder to keep track of payments on their own.

The department, he said, "did fail in getting information out effectively."

The report gave general fixes for avoiding a similar incident in the future. Orton said meals will never again be taken from kids, parents will be notified of low balances, and students can go into the red for a week and still receive meals.

Some parents weren't satisfied by the report, saying it was still unclear what the payment system's problems were and who was responsible for taking away the lunches.

"It was never answered who decided this," said parent Sarah Turley, who added that her child had her lunch tossed. That question of accountability and responsibility has never been answered, she said.
