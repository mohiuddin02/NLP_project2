WASHINGTON — In May 1995, geophysicist H. Jay Melosh attended a meeting of U.S. and ex-Soviet nuclear weapons designers. To his surprise, the Cold Warriors were eager to work together against an unlikely but dangerous extraterrestrial threat: asteroids on a collision course with Earth.

First Edward Teller, the father of the hydrogen bomb, urged others meeting at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California to consider building and orbiting huge, new nuclear weapons for planetary protection. Then some top Russian weapons experts lent their support.

"It was a really bizarre thing to see that these weapons designers were willing to work together — to build the biggest bombs ever," said Melosh.

Ever since, he has been pushing back against scientists who still support the nuclear option. He argues that non-nuclear solutions are both possible and far less dangerous.

## Collaborating To Stop Extraterrestrial Threats

But Melosh's campaign suffered a setback last month when the U.S. signed an agreement with Russia that could open the door to new collaboration between nuclear weapons scientists. A Sept. 16 Department of Energy announcement cited "defense from asteroids" as one potential area of study.

President Barack Obama has committed the United States to seeking a world without nuclear weapons. But NASA is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to study their use against asteroids.

Weapons experts in the United States and Russia also are citing the asteroid threat as a reason to hold onto — or to build — very large-yield nuclear explosives. Demand for those weapons is otherwise decreasing.

David Wright of the Union of Concerned Scientists said he hoped asteroid defense work would not become a "jobs program" for weapons scientists.

"When you've got the weapons labs sort of pushing for this in the various countries, it starts to make me feel a little uneasy," he said. "Which doesn't mean it's not a legitimate thing to do, but you want to know it's being done for legitimate reasons."

To some critics, the idea smacks of bad science fiction. It sounds, they say, like something out of the 1998 Bruce Willis action film "Armageddon," in which a team lands on an Earth-bound asteroid, plants a nuclear warhead and blows the rock into halves that just miss Earth.

Critics note that work on the nuclear option could run afoul of several international pacts. One is the 1967 Outer Space Treaty signed by 129 countries, which prohibits deploying nuclear weapons in space.

Some experts also worry that radioactive debris from blasting an asteroid could itself cause enormous damage on Earth.

## Advantages Of Using Nuclear Weapons

But the nuclear option does have strong supporters. Bong Wie, the director of Iowa State University's Asteroid Deflection Research Center, said he has a grant from NASA to design a "hypervelocity nuclear interceptor system." Basically, that's a missile-borne warhead fitted with a battering ram.

The ram would separate from the bomb before impact, gouging a crater in the asteroid so the bomb could then blast it to bits.

Keith Holsapple, an engineering professor at the University of Washington, said NASA has given him a grant to study how either an impact device or a nuclear explosion could deflect an Earth-bound asteroid from its path.

The leading U.S. supporter of the nuclear solution is probably David S.P. Dearborn, a research physicist and weapons designer at Lawrence Livermore. He is presently helping refurbish the U.S. nuclear arsenal.

Wie called Dearborn a senior figure among scientists studying the nuclear option. "I am just following in his footsteps," he said.

Dearborn said that he was offended years ago when other researchers told reporters that nuclear weapons simply couldn't work against asteroids. "That's just not true," he said.

For years, Dearborn worked to refute the skeptics on his own time. Since 2012, he said, he has had a grant from Lawrence Livermore to work on the project part time. He estimated that about a dozen other scientists have studied aspects of the approach at U.S. weapons labs.

Nuclear weapons could be used in two ways, he said. If the collision was still at least a decade away, a nuclear blast could knock the asteroid off course. If time was shorter, defenders would try to blow up the asteroid.

"You fragment it with enough force so that the pieces spread out," and mostly miss the Earth, he said. Small bits of rock would burn up in the atmosphere.

There would be no need to build new weapons or test old ones, he said. But shattering a large asteroid close to hitting Earth probably would require a weapon with a yield of about a megaton, or 1 million tons of TNT. This is roughly the power of the largest bomb in the current U.S. arsenal.

Mark Boslough, a physicist at Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico, has studied the possible effects of nuclear blasts on asteroids. He agrees that on short notice nuclear "really is the only option."

## Bombs Not The Only Option

Melosh disagrees. Ninety percent of the biggest asteroids already have been found and ruled out as a near-term threat, he claims. So there is time to find suitable, non-nuclear alternatives — such as hitting asteroids with rams, zapping them with lasers, tugging them off a kamikaze trajectory, or deflecting them with solar sails.

And Melosh has direct experience of one of his ideas. In 2005 he served as co-investigator on a NASA mission known as Deep Impact, which launched an 820-pound copper-covered battering ram that gouged a crater out of the comet Tempel 1.

For nuclear bombs to work even as a last-ditch effort, he said, they would need to be more powerful than any that currently exist. "A lot more people," he warned, "have died from nuclear weapons" than from "asteroid impacts."
