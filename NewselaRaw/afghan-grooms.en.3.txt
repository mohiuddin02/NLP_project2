ANDKHOY, Afghanistan â€” Esmatullah is a day worker who got engaged in 1999 at age 26. His bride-to-be was a young girl from a village near his hometown in western Afghanistan. The marriage was arranged by his relatives, and he was eager to wed. Fourteen years later, Esmatullah is still waiting.

Afghan weddings come with many old traditions, and one of them is the custom known as walwar. It requires the groom-to-be to pay cold cash to the bride's father. The bride and groom's families haggle over the amount, which can top $20,000. For many working-class Afghans, it's a sum they cannot dream of affording.

Andkhoy is a town of carpet makers and wheat farmers, where many fiances borrow from relatives and friends. They have to pay the money back over months or years. For common laborers like Esmatullah, the amount is far out of reach. His future in-laws insist on $13,000. Friends and relatives lent him $8,000. But he has no way of coming up with the rest.

"I make $6 a day as a day laborer," says Esmatullah, who only uses one name, like many Afghans. "God knows how long it will take me to raise the rest."

## A Tradition Criticized But Continuing

Women's rights supporters strongly criticize the tradition. They say it places a price tag on a daughter and gives people the idea that women are no more than property. "It's basically money that the father gets for selling his daughter," says Mojgan Mostafavi, a member of the Afghan Women's Affairs Ministry. "They are saying, 'You are like our animal.' "

Walwar is against the law in Afghanistan. But officials still allow it because it has been a part of Afghan tribal life for centuries. Fathers or grooms who make walwar payments are rarely punished, Mostafavi says. It also unfairly loads young grooms with the burden of debt, she adds.

Mostafavi called on religious leaders, reporters, and police to help end the practice. She said it goes against both Afghan and religious law. Recently, about 400 religious leaders came to the capital, Kabul, to speak out against walwar. They agreed to preach against the tradition at their mosques, where many Afghans go to worship.

Walwar is just one part of Afghan weddings that is over the top. The average worker makes $35 a month. But Afghans spend tens of thousands of dollars on a wedding. Guest lists are often in the hundreds.

Asadullah, 21, recently spent $28,000 on his wedding. The law student paid $13,000 in walwar. The bride's jewelry, another tradition, cost $12,000. And it was $3,000 for the reception. "It's a lot of money, but this is our society," said Asadullah. "We have no choice but to pay."

## A Lavish Wedding To Escape Misery

In 2011 politicians proposed a bill to limit wedding halls to no more than 500 guests. The Women's Affairs Ministry supported the bill. But it was rejected by President Hamid Karzai's Cabinet. The government never got a chance to vote on it, Mostafavi says.

"They are spending so much money, but these families often don't have enough money to buy food," she says. "I know some families that have had 3,000 to 4,000 guests at their weddings. In this country, a boy has to work so many years and borrow so much money to have a wedding. Why is this happening? It's a big roadblock for girls and boys in this society."

Pride is a major reason for the expense attached to Afghan weddings, says Samir Rostiyar. He is a wedding hall owner in Kabul. Families enjoy impressing their friends and neighbors with bigger, pricier parties. Even if they're not competitive, they don't want the shame of being called cheap.

Expensive weddings are also a way of escaping everyday Afghan life, if only for one night.

"Afghanistan has been at war for 30 years," Rostiyar says. "People spend this much money to get a break from all the misery."

## Long Road To Pay Walwar 
Afghanistan only got rid of its last king in 1973. Since then, power has shifted back and forth. Communists, Islamic extremists, and the current government all fought for control. That means a young person getting married today will never have experienced peacetime in his or her own country.

Abdullah Rahman got engaged to his 19-year-old fiancee a year ago. The woman's father set the walwar price at $15,000. Rahman, 23, his father and one of his brothers bargained him down to $10,000.

To begin raising the money, Rahman had to leave college and take on odd jobs in his hometown, Andkhoy. So far, he's been able to pay his future father-in-law only about $1,000.

"My father's working and I'm working to make the money," Rahman said. "I have no idea how long it will take. It's very hard to focus on life, focus on saving the money. It's a tradition and we have to pay it, but I hope someday someone gets rid of this custom."
