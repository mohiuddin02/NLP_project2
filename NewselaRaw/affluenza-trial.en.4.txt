HOUSTON â€” Ethan Couch is a rich 16-year-old. In June, he drove after drinking alcohol. He hit four people with his car and killed them. Ethan could have gone to prison for 20 years for his crime. Instead, a Fort Worth judge is not sending Ethan to jail at all.

Ethan will be under tight supervision for 10 years. He will also get treatment for being addicted to alcohol. He will have to stay out of trouble for 10 years.

At Ethan's trial, a doctor who studies behavior spoke. The doctor said that Ethan was not responsible for what he did.

He said Ethan was too spoiled. He was too focused on material things to control himself. He also said Ethan couldn't understand how what he did could hurt others. In other words, he suffered from "affluenza".

## Not A Real Illness

"Affluenza" combines the words affluent and influenza. Affluent means "rich." Influenza is "the flu." The term was usually used to describe children from rich families. These children could do bad things like do drugs or drink alcohol. Then they would say they could not be blamed. "Affluenza" is not a real illness.

Dr. Gary Buffone is a doctor who studies behavior. He is from Florida and he gives advice to rich families. He said "affluenza" was never meant to be used in court.

Ethan's trial has made experts and the victims' families very angry. They don't believe in "affluenza." They say the judge's choice makes people think that Ethan got out of jail because his family is rich.

What the judge has done, Buffone said, is only give the child a time-out for a very serious crime. It's very scary, he said.

In court, there was a prosecution lawyer. He was fighting to put Ethan in jail. The lawyer said Ethan would only do more bad things if he was not put in jail.

## Sending A Bad Message?

The judge has not openly said why she didn't send Ethan to prison. A newspaper reported that the judge said Ethan's parents could afford good therapy for him. The judge said it was better than what he would get in jail. His parents would pay to send him to an expensive treatment center in California.

Suniya Luthar is a doctor who studies behavior. She has done research on kids from rich areas. She said just under a fourth of upper middle-class teens think their parents would help them get out of a sticky situation at school. Ethan's court case backs up that thinking, she said. Luthar said there is one type of justice for the rich. There is another type for the poor.

The case sends the message that "you can drink and drive" if your family has money. This is a very, very scary thing to tell our children, she said.

Ethan hit and killed 43-year-old Brian Jennings. He killed 24-year-old Breanna Mitchell and 21-year-old Shelby Boyles. He also killed Shelby's mother, 52-year-old Hollie Boyles.

Scott Brown, Ethan's main lawyer, said supervision was the right choice. The teenager could have been freed after two years if he had been sentenced to 20 years in prison, he said. Instead, Ethan will be under heavy supervision for the next 10 years, he said.
