On Friday, hunters will begin arriving at the Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge in Florida. Loxahatchee is a vast sweep of swamp and forest. It stretches between Boca Raton and Wellington.

The hunters are coming with one purpose: to kill some of the refuge's alligators.

Eleven hunters were awarded permits to take down two alligators each. A total of 1,203 people applied for permits. The winners were selected by chance, in a drawing.

The hunters will primarily work at night. They will be allowed to kill alligators in various ways. Some might kill them with sticks with sharp knives on the end called harpoons. Others might use spear guns, crossbows or a "bang stick." The bang stick is a pole that shoots a bullet into the alligator's brain.

The hunt will run through October. The hunters will be allowed to bring helpers.

## Hunters And Protesters

When the first hunters arrive on Friday, they will be greeted by protesters. The protesters are members of the Animal Rights Foundation of Florida. Several other groups are also opposed to the hunt.

"It's not a refuge" if there is "animal killing going on there," said protester Don Anthony. "These animals are harpooned, stabbed or hooked." They "never die a quick or painless death." Not only is the hunt "bloody," he said, it's also "unnecessary."

Rolf Olson is project leader at Loxahatchee. He defended the hunt.

Hunting has been traditional at wildlife refuges since the time of President Theodore Roosevelt, Olson said. The president established the nation's first national wildlife refuge in 1903. Roosevelt was also a hunter himself.

What's more, Olson said, hunting is not new to Loxahatchee. The refuge has long allowed duck hunting.

## A Lot Of Alligators

Olson said the alligator population at Loxahatchee is large. A survey at one canal, he added, found 134 of them.

The refuge, he said, has plenty of alligators. The hunt, he insisted, shouldn't have any real effect on "the total alligator population."

Olson said the protesters were welcome to express their opinions at the refuge. However, they will not be permitted to try to stop the hunt.

They have a "right" to protest, he said. "They will be able to protest and speak their minds." As long as they don't break the law, "they're allowed to be in the area."

He said the protesters will not be hidden away. Any hunters arriving will see them.

## Friday And Saturday Nights

The protest is planned at the refuge's south entrance. The visitor's entrance is located miles away from that spot.

The refuge has said the hunt may be expanded in the future. For that to happen, though, all will have to go smoothly this time.

Law enforcement officers will oversee the hunt.

The hunt is timed so that few visitors to the refuge will see any hunters, Olson said. It will take place only on Friday and Saturday nights. Hunters will be allowed in only during certain hours: from an hour before sunset until an hour after sunrise.

Most of the hunters "will be there when no one else is out there," he said.
