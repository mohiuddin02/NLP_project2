The Texas police officer who has been widely condemned for his aggressive handling of black teenagers at a pool party has resigned. His attorney announced the resignation on Tuesday.

Corporal Eric Casebolt had been suspended since Sunday. The suspension came after video emerged of him aggressively confronting the teenagers at the party Friday evening in McKinney, a suburb of Dallas. Casebolt can be seen drawing his gun on the unarmed teenagers and throwing a 14-year-old girl in a bikini to the ground.

The video, which was shot by a bystander, garnered millions of views on YouTube. It shows Casebolt shouting and cursing at teenagers who do not appear to be acting violently or aggressively, with Casebolt wrestling some black teenagers to the ground.

## After Protest, Police Promise An Inquiry

Officials said residents had called the police to complain about an out-of-control party. Some teenagers said they had permission to be at the pool and said residents had harassed them. The incident prompted a protest Monday as police promised to investigate Casebolt's actions.

A spokesman for the McKinney Police Department could not immediately be reached for a comment.

The episode has tapped into the ongoing national furor over how police handle black community members. The incident was unusual in that no one involved appears to have been seriously hurt.

## Video Evokes Memories Of Segregation

Even so, the video proved to be evocative enough to draw widespread public condemnation. For some critics, it summoned memories of the nation's segregation years, when blacks were denied the right to swim in pools with white Americans.

However, the McKinney Fraternal Order of Police, the union that represents Casebolt, said Monday that "this was not a racially motivated incident." It said McKinney police do not conduct "racially biased policing."

David Bradford, a policing expert and executive director of the Northwestern University Center for Public Safety, said the video suggests that Casebolt was overreacting. "In this particular case, the officer may have been overzealous in taking an enforcement role rather than a peacekeeper role."

## Expert Sees Need For More Training

"Just based on what I've seen in the video â€¦ if this was my department and that was my officer, we would definitely be doing some remedial training and some reorientation with regard to what our role is and what our job is in the community," Bradford said. He nonetheless cautioned that he would still want to know more about what happened before he reached a final conclusion about Casebolt's actions.

In a situation in which officers are facing large crowds and trying to restore the peace, Bradford said, "you would want to take calming actions to calm the party down" and break up the crowd "in a lawful manner."
