NEW YORK, N.Y. — Bernie Sanders is a senator from Vermont who is running for president. Like other people running for president, he uses technology to reach out to voters. He used to try to win over young voters mainly with Twitter. His posts were mainly copied from his long speeches. Sanders talks a lot about the large gap between rich and poor people in America.

Then Sanders joined Snapchat. On Snapchat, users can send photos and short videos to their friends that later disappear. Snapchat claims that a large number of America's young voters use the app. Already, many of them like Sanders. His bet is that Snapchat can help him make the most of his advantage with younger voters.

## It's SnapCHAT, Not SnapSHOT!

At first glance, Sanders seems like a strange fit for Snapchat. "What is this Snapshot thing and why do I only get 10 seconds?" Sanders tweeted on Monday to announce his new account. He has come late to Snapchat. His Democratic rivals, Martin O'Malley and Hillary Clinton, have been on Snapchat for several weeks. Most Republican candidates are also on Snapchat.

The primary elections will be held in March. If Sanders wins the Democratic primary election he will run for president against the winner of the Republican primary. The main election will be in November 2016. The Republicans and Democrats are both political groups.

## A Good Fit

Some information shows that Snapchat is a good fit for Sanders. About 100 million people use Snapchat every day. Nearly 4 out of 10 of the app's daily users are 18 to 24 years old, the Snapchat company says. Two-thirds of 18- to 34-year-old Snapchat users will probably vote in the election. About one-third of all 18- to 34-year-old likely voters use the app, according to an online survey of people's opinions.

Sanders's first story featured scenes from a speech he gave. His second story was about his plan for immigration. Immigrants are people who move to the United States. His stories are very serious.

Clinton joined Snapchat in early August. Unlike Sanders, Clinton often posts funny things. Her account often shows old photos of Clinton or pictures making fun of her Republican rivals.

## Popular With Young Voters

Kenneth Pennington is with the Sanders campaign. He said Sanders is popular with young voters. A national opinion survey found that Clinton had a big lead over Sanders. However, it was the opposite for people who are between 18 and 29 years old. Sanders was much more popular with those young voters than Clinton.

Pennington said Sanders is getting young people excited. "And it's not because the senator is some cool hip guy, it's just because his ideas are really appealing" to young voters. Sanders will likely use Snapchat to talk about issues young voters care about.

## A Message With App-eal?

Sierra Smith is a 19-year-old journalism student in Texas. She is just the sort of young voter the campaign hopes to reach. Many of Sanders' fans tweeted in approval of the senator's new Snapchat account. Smith was one of them and called it "the cutest thing ever." Later, Smith said she thought the app was a good way to keep people her age informed about Sanders' campaign. She plans to vote for him. She also said that if not for Sanders, she probably would not vote at all.

"I think a lot of the things that he says are things that people our age believe in," Smith said. "And he's the only one who's really just saying them."

Tad Devine works for Sanders. He said that campaigns usually do not pay much attention to young voters. Sanders will not make that mistake, he said.

To win the primary, Sanders must get many young people to vote for him. Devine  thinks the campaign can get a large number of them to go out and vote in March.  "And that can make a huge difference," Devine said.
