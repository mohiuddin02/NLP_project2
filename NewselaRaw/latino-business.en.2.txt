Edward Avila launched his first startup company a few years ago. He was already experienced in Silicon Valley, but as he mingled at business events, he noticed something disturbing.

Hundreds of people were trying to start businesses. But, "I felt like I was the only Latino in the room," he said.

He's not far off: Numbers from venture capital clearinghouse CB Insights indicate less than 1 percent of startups businesses that get money from venture capitalists have a Latino co-founder. Venture capital is the early money from investors that can get a new business going.

The lack of Latinos starting companies is especially sobering in northern California's Silicon Valley, the hub of the technology industry. Census figures show one-quarter of the valley's population is Hispanic.

## Seven Startups For A Start

Avila's job-placement startup never got off the ground, but the experience led him to start another venture that's now set to debut. It's an incubator to help Latino technology businesses get off the ground.

Singer and actress Jennifer Lopez and Google have put money into Avila's incubator.

"Everybody said, 'You're nuts,' but what I do well is bring in the right resources," said Avila, 44. Before trying to start his own businesses, Avila spent two decades working for tech giants like Intersil and Philips Semiconductors.

"Class" began this week for the first seven startups participating in San Jose-based Manos Accelerator. The venture takes its name from the Spanish word for hands. Avila and his co-founders say the name reflects the Latino work ethic. Avila's mother worked in a cannery after immigrating to the valley from Costa Rica.

Latino tech leaders praised the move. They also cautioned it will face tough sledding.

"I think it's going to take another generation, maybe two, to get out of the mode of an immigrant culture," said Hector Ruiz, the former chief executive of computer chip giant AMD. He said Latino parents tend to urge their children to land steady jobs rather. They do not want them to risk starting their own businesses.

## Lagging In Math And Sciences

Ruiz also pointed to the low numbers of Latinos who study science or business in college. Some do not even finish high school.

Just 50 percent of Latino students in California's public schools rate proficient or above in math, state figures show. That compares with 71 percent of whites and 85 percent of Asians.

"Look, I grew up in a town where the dropout rate for Hispanics was, like, 90 percent," said Texas-born Richard Leza. The longtime Silicon Valley businessman and venture capitalist has tried for more than a decade to pull more Latinos into tech.

Leza helped launch Hispanic Network a dozen years ago. It was modeled on the hugely influential group TiE, which started out as a way for South Asian businessmen in Silicon Valley to meet. TiE has grown into a global organization. But Hi-Net has struggled, Leza admitted.

You need connections to start a business, he said. "The problem is, Hispanics are not in big venture firms or large corporations like Google and Yahoo."

Avila is well aware that others have had limited success with the same mission. One of the co-founders of Manos, Sylvia Flores, worked a decade ago with Vicente Fox to found a venture that helps Mexican tech companies do business in Silicon Valley. Fox was president of Mexico at the time.

## Strutting Their Stuff On "Demo Day"

Flores is a former IBM engineer. She brought in the third member of the founding team, David Lopez. He is a longtime computer technician whose daughter happens to be J-Lo. Flores built the website for a restaurant David and Jennifer Lopez once owned in Pasadena, Calif.

The 12-week Manos program will include a trip to Los Angeles for the [entrepreneurs](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=entrepreneur) to pitch their ideas to Latino stars including Mario Lopez and Eva Longoria.

Unlike startups chosen for more established incubators like Y Combinator, the first companies at Manos won't receive funding. Avila hopes to raise money to invest in future participants.

Since most of the founders in the first batch of startups live outside the San Francisco Bay Area, Avila has hooked them up with housing. At his mom's place.

In exchange for a 4 percent piece of their companies, entrepreneurs in the program will gain access to mentors from Stanford, Apple and WalmartLabs, among others. It all leads up to a "demo day" at Google in November. The entrepreneurs will strut their stuff for potential investors.

## A Startup Called Sleek-Geek

Francisco Nieto, an Oakland, California schoolteacher who's one of the founders of a participating startup called Sleek-geek, said he's eager for introductions to the program's mentors and prospective funders. "We liked their mission and focus," he said of Manos.

Nieto's year-old startup makes apps to help kids improve their reading skills. He teaches technology to middle school students in Oakland's Fruitvale neighborhood. "I constantly remind my students, who are primarily Latino, that they are living in the most technologically innovative region on Earth," he said, "and that they should take advantage of the opportunities so that our communities are not left behind."

Avila said Manos received 75 submissions after the program was announced in July. About a third came from Latin America.

"Everybody's talking about finding that next Mark Zuckerberg or that next Larry Page," Avila said. They are the founders of Facebook and Google. "I'm hoping the next person they'll be talking about will be an Eric Florez. Why not?"
