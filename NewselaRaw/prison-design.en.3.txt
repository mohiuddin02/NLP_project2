SAN BRUNO, Calif. â€” The leaders for the design workshop at San Francisco's County Jail No. 5 came with lots of markers and kiddie scissors.

All the students were inmates at the jail. On this final day, their paper models were taking shape. They were working on ideas for a new jail building.

One of the workshop participants was Anthony Pratt, a tall man with tattoos on both arms.

The building he designed had a large room with a skylight to let the sun in. There was also a fountain with a waterfall, private showers and toilets. In the middle of everything there was a healing center with many windows.

Most men in the county jail have been accused of committing violent crimes. They are awaiting trial.

All must agree to join in a program called "Resolve to Stop the Violence."

## What It's All About

The program includes classes about a new way of thinking called "restorative justice." Retorative justice tries to heal crime victims and crime offenders alike.

There were 18 men enrolled in the four-day workshop this summer. They were learning about how to use the design of buildings and spaces for restorative justice.

As Pratt concentrated on his drawing, Keith Wilkins cut the waterfall for the model. Both men have been accused of killing other people.

Another participant, Lamar Paschall, helped with the trees. He has been accused of crimes including kidnapping and robbery.

Some of their building ideas had individual cells with Internet connections and outdoor decks.

Prisons like that exist in the country of Norway. But they are not likely to become part of U.S. prison design any time soon.

## The Program Is Growing

A growing number of people now believe that traditional criminal justice models are not helping to stop offenders from committing crimes again.

Deanna VanBuren and Barb Toews were the teachers at the workshop in the county jail. They have joined designers, researchers, judges and people in charge of prisons, asking for new spaces that match restorative justice's ideals.

Those ideals were first explained by Howard Zehr, a professor at Eastern Mennonite University's Center for Justice and Peacebuilding. The goal was to pay close attention to the needs of the victims.

Some people say restorative justice is shaped by people's personal feelings, tastes and opinions. It could lead to remedies that are very different from each other. As a result, some victims' groups and lawyers do not accept it.

But restorative justice is growing throughout the United States and the world.

There's more evidence it helps keep young people in schools and out of the criminal justice system. It also prevents youths and adults from repeating their past crimes.

## A Winner, A Loser And Outsiders

VanBuren is an architect who designs buildings. She was working for a big firm when she heard a restorative justice supporter named Azim Khamisa on a podcast.

Khamisa's son was murdered by a teenage gang member. After that, he reached out to the boy's grandfather and the killer, so they could all heal. The two older men launched the Tariq Khamisa Foundation in San Diego to address the roots of youth violence.

Toews, meanwhile, got started in restorative justice in the 1990s while doing voluntary service. In 2000, she conducted a workshop in a Pennsylvania prison with 13 inmates. Most of them had killed someone.

The men there didn't want to share their feelings. But she convinced them. She told them the traditional system is like a boxing ring, with a winner and loser and outsiders determining the result.

She asked them to create a room where they could face anything they have done in the past and respond to it.

Together, they created a vision and called it the "Do No Harm" room.

## The Tree Has Meaning

On the final workshop day, the participants pieced together their models with glue, sticks and tape.

Deandre Hill and Christopher Gillis sat side by side. They imagined a cell with a computer to talk with family. It also had a lot of natural light.

"The most important thing is to be accountable, but in order to work on yourself you have to be comfortable," said Gillis.

He is planning a restorative justice circle and wants to "make up for the harm" he had caused to his 16-year-old.

Then it was time to present their models to the larger pod and a panel of outside reviewers.

As his teammates stood beside him, Dante Hayes, another participant, showed a design with a tree in the atrium representing "the ability for us to grow." A kitchen would feed all visitors.

## The Goal Of The Workshops

In a closing circle after the presentation, Pratt said his whole outlook had changed: Instead of "just beating each other upside the head, we can be like family."

VanBuren said she is talking to big architecture companies that design prisons. She is urging them to hold similar workshops with inmates and guards.

She said the goal is to prod architects to actually talk to the people for whom they are designing the building. "That's how an architect would practice in any other setting."
