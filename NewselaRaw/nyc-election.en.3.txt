NEW YORK â€” Bill de Blasio will be New York City's first Democratic mayor in 20 years. He defeated Republican Joe Lhota in Tuesday's election.

De Blasio is the city's public advocate, an elected official who helps people have a voice in the city's government. Lhota was chief of the New York area's transportation agency.

De Blasio will replace current mayor Michael Bloomberg.

His campaign focused on ideas like raising taxes on the rich. He also had other ideas about how government can improve the lives of New Yorkers. His plans are a lot different than the things Bloomberg did in his 12 years as mayor.

## Fat Gap Between Rich And Poor

De Blasio, 52, will take office on Jan. 1. He will be the 109th mayor of the nation's largest city. He had been heavily favored to win and held a huge lead in surveys for weeks.

Bloomberg first ran as a Republican and later became an independent. He guided the city through the years after the 9/11 attack and through a tough time after the stock market crashed and many jobs disappeared. He is leaving office after three four-year terms.

De Blasio ran as the anti-Bloomberg. He got angry about the big gap between the poor and the rich, which he said Bloomberg helped cause. Bloomberg is a billionaire and favored big business.

De Blasio comes from Brooklyn. He reached out to New Yorkers he said were left behind because Bloomberg was often focused on Manhattan. He called for a tax increase on the rich to pay for pre-kindergarten classes for all children. De Blasio also pledged to improve job opportunities in minority and poor neighborhoods.

He was against a police department practice where police stopped and frisked people on the street. A judge ruled that police had unfairly singled out blacks and Hispanics to be stopped. The ruling helped De Blasio's campaign. De Blasio is a white man married to a black woman. He was also helped when his son appeared in a campaign ad.

## City Hungry For Change

De Blasio worked for both Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton and Gov. Andrew Cuomo. He was also known for deals done behind the scenes when he was on the City Council.

Lhota, 59, slammed de Blasio's view on jobs and the poor. He said de Blasio was trying to pit rich and poor against each other.

Lhota also said stop-and-frisk helped lower crime in the city. He said that a de Blasio victory would return the city to its past when crime was more common.

Polling shows New Yorkers mostly support Bloomberg's practices. But those same surveys showed that the city was hungry for a change.

People who sign-up as Democrats outnumber Republicans in the city 6-to-1. But the last time a Democrat was elected mayor was 1989. David Dinkins won then. De Blasio worked for Dinkins during that time.

## A Big Win

De Blasio could beat Abe Beame's 40-point win in 1973. That was the largest victory by somebody who wasn't already mayor since 1897. The vote is still being finalized.

Lhota worked for Rudolph Giuliani, who was mayor before Bloomberg. He announced he was running for mayor after he received praise for how he ran the city's transportation department during last year's Superstorm Sandy. But his campaign struggled in the beginning and he was slow to raise money.

De Blasio wasn't expected to be the one running for mayor against Lhota. He spent most of the year in fourth place in the Democratic Primary. He trailed City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, Anthony Weiner, and the Democrats' 2009 candidate, Bill Thompson.

But Thompson's campaign never got going. And Quinn's campaign was hurt when she helped change the city's rule to let Bloomberg run a third time in 2009. When Weiner's support fell apart, many of his backers went to de Blasio.
