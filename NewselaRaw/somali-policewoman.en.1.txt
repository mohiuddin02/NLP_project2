ST. PAUL, Minn. — Kadra Mohamed is a regular at the Grocery and Meat Market on this city's north side. She grew up in a public housing project nearby and shopped here with her mother as a girl.

In the store, she breathes in the familiar smell of Somali spices and the bread she has loved since she was a child.

The market's owner, Abdi Mohamed, steps out from behind his shelves to greet her.

"Kadra, it's you," he says in the rhythmic Somali language. He asks about her mother, and then pauses. "It's good to see you in uniform."

## Breaking New Ground

Kadra Mohamed, 22, is a new cop on the beat. She's a community officer paying a visit to a local business owner — a time-tested community policing method. Mohamed is doing traditional police work, but at the same time, she's breaking new ground: she is the first female Somali officer in the St. Paul Police Department.

There are more than 80,000 Somali Americans in the twin cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul,  making up the nation's largest Somali community. Relations between the immigrant community and the city can be tense and a police officer like Mohamed is one step toward reducing tensions.

Each time she puts on her crisp blue-and-white police uniform with its thick black leather belt and handcuffs, Mohamed, who is 5-foot-1, also puts on her hijab, the traditional headscarf worn in public by many Muslim women.

Reaction to Mohamed has been mixed in this Midwestern city of 290,000 residents. One blogger objected to her wearing a hijab while on duty, saying the department "has placed her life on the line in more ways than one."

Some officers have complained that by wearing a hijab, Mohamed is breaking the traditional uniform code. Mohamed's hijab has been modified with metal snaps so it can come off in a scuffle.

## Rules Can Be Changed

St. Paul Police Assistant Chief Todd Axtell said all rules, even uniform codes, are made to be changed. "In the early 1970s, you had to be at least 5-foot-8 to become a St. Paul police officer," said Axtell, who is 5-foot-7. "If that rule hadn't been changed, I wouldn't be here today."

Mohamed doesn't apologize for going into police work. She once wanted to be a lawyer, but changed her goal to police work because she wanted to help her community.

Some criticism of Mohamed has come from the Somali-American community itself. Older Somalis say she's breaking cultural norms: wearing pants and short-sleeve shirts, and working closely among men in public. After Mohamed passes her police exams, she will apply for a job as a sworn officer, which means she would carry a gun.

Mohamed's hiring comes at a time of urgent need for the Somali community. There has been a rise in Somali street gangs such as the St. Pistol Boys and Somali Outlaws and other Somali American young people have left Minnesota to fight with extremist groups in Somalia, Syria and Iraq.

The tension between Somalis, many of whom are Muslim, and the city is as high as it's ever been since 2001, some say.

## She Has "Defied Logic"

Enter Mohamed. "(She) has defied logic for whites and Somalis alike," said local activist Omar Jamal. "She's a mystery to both cultures."

Mohamed was born in a refugee camp in Kenya in 1991, not long after her parents fled Mogadishu, Somalia's capital, and its nearly daily bombings and violent chaos. Her Ethiopian father, Hassan, and her Somali mother, Zamzam, were joined by an arranged marriage.

"Love takes time," Mohamed said. "Their relationship started off cordially, then a friendship developed before they grew into loving one another. They got lucky."

The family eventually moved to the Twin Cities, an area with a reputation for welcoming new immigrants. Mohamed's parents had four more children — two boys and two girls.

Her father, an immigration case worker, died when she was 12, and Mohamed grew up fast.

Mohamed was attending St. Cloud State University outside the Twin Cities when she decided to start wearing a hijab. She quickly learned about racism, as strangers told her to "take the towel off your head," and "go back to your terror state."

## Showing A Friendly Face

As a community liaison officer, Mohamed is often called on to translate, but most of her duties involve showing a friendly face in public housing projects, where many immigrants live. She often rides with her partner, Tom Lee, 24, who works in the Hmong community of southeast Asian immigrants.

Walking through a community cookout at a housing complex, Mohamed runs into an old friend, Nada Mohamed, who is also wearing a hijab. Nada is proud of her friend, but said older members of the Somali community don't always agree.

"They think she's crazy," she says. "They don't think a Muslim woman should be a police officer, no matter if she wears a hijab or not."

Mohamed has decided to become a sworn police officer, even if her mother insists she won't let a gun in the house. "I tell her, 'Mom, you've been though a civil war, how can you be afraid of guns?'"

One day, Mohamed might be working as a gang unit officer or identifying political extremists in her community. She's not afraid of arresting a Somali man, something that would be unthinkable in traditional Somali male-dominated culture.

"I'll speak to him in our language — Somali to Somali," she says. "I'll explain that this is my job. He broke the law and there are steps that must be taken."
