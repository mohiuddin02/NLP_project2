DALLAS â€” Isaac Doss sits at a hookah bar here on a muggy Thursday. He inhales smoke from a water pipe. As he exhales, clouds of smoke pour out of his mouth. He passes the pipe to Kara Brick. Doss and Brick are celebrating the return of Brick's sister from Europe.

Hookah bars are becoming more and more popular with young adults. About 1 in 5 students smoked hookah in the last year, according to a study published in the magazine Pediatrics.

The dangers of smoking cigarettes are well known, but doctors warn that smoking tobacco from a hookah, or water pipe, can be even more dangerous.

To smoke a cigarette, the user lights the tobacco on fire and inhales the smoke directly. With a hookah, a charcoal brick lights the tobacco. The smoke passes through a water bowl before the user inhales it through a tube.

Because cigarettes and hookah involve smoking tobacco, both put dangerous chemicals into the body. Smoking from a hookah delivers more dangerous chemicals than cigarette smoking, according to the National Institutes of Health.

## "It Is More Dangerous"

Smoking hookah one time can deliver 1.7 times the nicotine, 6.5 times the carbon monoxide, and 46 times the tar of a single cigarette.

Nicotine is the addictive chemical in tobacco. It's what makes people want to keep smoking. Carbon monoxide can cause brain damage and even death. Tar contains carcinogens, which cause cancer.

"There is no reason to believe that a water pipe is less dangerous than a cigarette," says Dr. Thomas Eissenberg, who has done many studies on water pipe smoking. "In fact, depending on some of the toxins, there is reason to believe it is more dangerous."

Doss, now 25, says he started smoking when he was 18, at the University of the Ozarks in Arkansas.

"I smoked every weekend. I never considered how bad it would be for me," Doss said.

Now, Doss says he is more aware of the health risks of hookah.

## High School Seniors Smoking Hookah

It's not just college students who are smoking hookah. More high school seniors are smoking it too, according to a University of Michigan study.

These young people may not realize they're inhaling tobacco, charcoal smoke and other carcinogens with each breath.

Packs of cigarettes carry labels like "SMOKING KILLS" and "SMOKING CAUSES LUNG CANCER," but there are no warnings at hookah bars.

"The problem is, if you go into a water pipe bar and look at the pipe you are being served, there is nothing on that pipe or on the tobacco or in that charcoal that tells you it's dangerous," Eissenberg says.

Some young people seem to think "It doesn't say it's dangerous, so it must be safe," he adds.

But the latest science is showing that smoking hookah is definitely not safe. Hookah smoke contains higher levels of lead, nickel and arsenic. It has 36 times more tar and 15 times more carbon monoxide than cigarettes, recent research shows.

A user must inhale harder and longer to smoke hookah compared to cigarettes. This increases the amount of carcinogens and nicotine in the lungs.

Hookah smokers take "an entire cigarette's worth of smoke in a single puff," Eissenberg says.

## Nicotine, Tar And Other Toxins

The longer a hookah session, the more nicotine and toxins a user takes in. Smoking hookah for 45 minutes to an hour can expose users to about the same amount of nicotine and tar as a whole pack of cigarettes, according to Eissenberg. There are 20 cigarettes in a pack.

"If you aren't a cigarette smoker because you know cigarettes are dangerous, then there is absolutely no reason to be smoking a water pipe and every reason to avoid it for the same reason," he says. "Water pipe smoking will kill you also."

Farhad Ata owns Kush Hookah Lounge, where Doss and Brick were smoking. Ata has smoked hookah his entire life, but he knows it is not healthy.

"It is still tobacco, no matter what, even if it is flavored," Ata said. "Your lungs are meant for air. Any type of smoke is not good for you, whether it's cigarettes or hookah."

Dr. Mark Millard, a medical director at a lung-care center, has practiced medicine in the Middle East, where water pipe smoking has been widespread for more than 400 years. On one trip, he treated a woman from Saudi Arabia who had a violent cough.

"She was smoking every night for an hour," he says. "That is quite a lot. I told her to get rid of her hubbly bubbly (hookah). It's nicotine that is the addictive factor. It makes people want to come back for more. People can get addicted to hookahs, and it does affect your health."
