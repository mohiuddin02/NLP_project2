CHICAGO — Tara Montgomery never thought she would join her high school's rowing team. She only did after her mom offered her an iPhone to join.

Tara's mom hoped that her daughter would become a skilled rower. She knew that rowers could get college scholarships worth tens of thousands of dollars. Scholarships can be given by schools to students who have good grades or are good at sports. They may cover part, or even all, of the cost of college.

Four years after Tara joined the rowing team she won a scholarship to the University of Tennessee. It's a full scholarship. Nearly all of her college costs will be covered by it.

"I have a single mother. She could not afford for me to go to a four-year university," Montgomery said. Rowing has given her opportunities she wouldn't have had.

College sports are doing very well. Colleges make money from showing the sports on TV. They also use sports teams as a way to attract new students.

Women's sports are enjoying this success as well.

In men's sports, most scholarships go to football or basketball players. But for women, there are many more sports that give scholarships. Among these are less-popular sports such as bowling, horseback riding and rowing.

## Bowling: 53 Colleges, 358 Scholarships

Julia Bond started bowling at age 11. Her father gave her some key advice: watch good bowlers and copy them.

It turned out to be great advice. Now Bond is a high school senior and one of the best high school bowlers in the country. She has bowled two perfect games. A perfect game is 12 strikes in a row, which is a remarkably difficult thing to do.

Many colleges wanted her. In November, she accepted a full scholarship offer from the University of Nebraska.

"I enjoy the competitiveness," said Bond. "Bowling is a team sport but you still have to perform by yourself. If something goes wrong, you can't blame anybody but yourself."

## Equestrian (Horseback Riding): 23 Colleges, 540 Scholarships

Hayley Banas rides horses for her high school. She didn't have colleges coming to her. She went to them.

She liked the program at Southern Methodist University in Dallas and reached out to them.

"She emailed and called a lot," said coach Natalie Burton. "She got my attention."

Learning jumping and riding skills on horses can take years of practice, Burton said.

Banas, 18, takes her sport seriously.  At the beginning,  she spent two hours a day on one of her family's horses. When she got to high school, she spent months getting home-schooled so she could live and train in Florida during the winter.

## Rowing: 106 Colleges, 2,000 Scholarships

Kate Stolar tried a lot of sports when she was young. She wasn't very good at any of them. She wasn't a good T-ball player and she didn't make her high school dance team.

Only 5 feet tall, Stolar thought she couldn't be a good rower. The other girls were often over 6 feet tall, and much stronger than her.

But then she got a chance to be the coxswain — the person who steers the boat and shouts directions to the rowers. It fit her perfectly.

"You have to be small, you have to be light. But beyond that you have to be somebody who's really loud, who likes to be in charge, who thinks under pressure," said her coach, Mike Wallin.

Stolar, 17, is outgoing. Her friendly personality helped when she was searching for a scholarship. She sent out tons of emails and made many phone calls. And she talked to coaches at competitions.

In November, her hard work paid off. She accepted an athletic scholarship that will pay for her books at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. It's a small reward, but a welcome one.

The fact that she's even a college athlete just blows her mind, she said. "I'm not that athletic but I'm a very competitive person."
