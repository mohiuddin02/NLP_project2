SHANI SHINGANAPUR, India — Nanasahib Bankar is a successful farmer and businessman in this small temple town. He worries about many things. Among them are sugar cane prices, the health of his cattle and the success of his son's new hotel.

One thing he does not worry about is losing his keys. His house, like nearly all the others here, doesn't have a door.

Bankar stands under the bare door frame of the red-brick house he shares with 12 family members. With arms folded over his large belly, the 64-year-old says simply, "This is the way we have always lived."

## Believers Protect The Legend

Legend has it that the Hindu god Shani watches over Shani Shinganapur, preventing crime and punishing thieves. Hinduism is the largest religion in India. Lord Shani is just one of many Hindu gods.

Believers say that to install a door with a latch or a cupboard with locks would be to question Lord Shani's powers and invite his anger. Some older people who live in town use curtains instead of doors even for their bedrooms, and most people do not lock their cars or motorbikes. Shopkeepers say they sometimes leave cash in their drawers overnight.

The only bank in town has a clear plexiglass front door, but remains unlocked day and night. Only the safe-deposit box is locked.

## No Worries, It's Not Locked

After dark, Bankar draws a simple gray curtain across his front doorway. He holds the curtain in place with a slab of wood. The main threat of a break-in, he said, comes from stray dogs and snakes.

In a bedroom is Bankar's daughter-in-law, Vaishana. She is a pretty young woman who wears a sari and dangly white earrings. Vaishana giggles when asked where she keeps her wedding jewelry, her most valuable possession. She reaches under her bed and slides out a battered blue suitcase.

"See," Bankar says proudly, "it's not locked and we don't worry."

## The Mystery Stone Speaks

In a land filled with Hindu temples, the legend of Shani Shinganapur has brought the area some fame. Thousands of people each day visit this otherwise ordinary town of about 15,000 people in western India.

The origins of the temple are as much a part of local legend as the crime-free image.

Hundreds of years ago — no one seems to know exactly when — the river running through the village coughed up a 5-foot block of black stone. When the stone was tapped, the story goes, blood oozed from its surface.

People who live in the town say no one dared to move the slab until, one night, a farmer dreamed that the stone spoke to him. It identified itself as Shani, the Hindu god associated with the planet Saturn. "I want to remain here," the stone said, and the next day farmers carried it up to dry land.

When villagers tried to construct a building to house the stone, however, there were problems. Walls collapsed. Construction workers suffered injuries. The people decided that the Shani could not be housed in a traditional temple. Instead, they placed it on an open-air platform. Then the villagers made their homes "open air" by getting rid of their doors.

## Nonbelievers Are Not So Sure

Over the years, the legend has grown. Bankar's grandfather would tell how raiders from another village came one night and stole a bull. They walked and walked, but when the sun rose they found themselves still in Shani Shinganapur. They had wandered in circles and were captured.

To some, such tales are pure superstition and a way to attract tourists. They say small crimes occur but temple officials keep the reports quiet because they want to protect Shani Shinganapur's reputation.

If the town is so safe, these non-believers ask, why does the temple's donation box have a lock?

Five years ago, a visitor from northern India complained that his camera, phone and some cash were stolen. Recently, police said a pickpocket tried to snatch money from a visitor.

Today, there are reports of teenagers harassing tourists. Some say prices for souvenirs are much higher than they should be.

## Changes Are Taking Place

Finally, in September, there was an unmistakable sign that the town had to face the truth. A police station opened in Shani Shinganapur for the first time.

Two weeks after the ceremonial opening, a shred of cheap pink ribbon is still attached to the door frame of Assistant Police Inspector Prashant Mandale's office. It is held in place by two strips of masking tape.

Yes, Mandale says, the station has doors, but out of respect for local customs they do not have locks.
