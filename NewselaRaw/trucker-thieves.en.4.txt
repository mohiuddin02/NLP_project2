WICHITA, Kan. â€” Thieves around the country have come up with a simple way of stealing cargo. They are dressing up like truck drivers. They load the goods onto their own tractor-trailers and then drive away.

This type of crime has become more common. It has allowed thieves to steal millions of dollars in cargo every year. These goods are often food and drinks. And experts say the practice is growing so fast that it will soon become the most common way to steal goods.

A generation ago, thieves would drive loaded trucks out of parking lots. Then the industry started using tracking devices, high-tech locks and other protection. Now, thieves are changing how they do business, too.

Experts say the Internet helps the thieves. Criminals can see information about the trucking industry. Internet databases allow them to see the names of real truck companies. Then they can pretend to be those truckers and to look for goods they want to steal.

## Companies And Consumers Get Hurt

This hurts companies that sell things. It also hurts shoppers. Prices go up. Unsafe food and drugs can reach store shelves.

Newspapers across the country have reported on a few of the thefts. Thieves stole 80,000 pounds of walnuts worth $300,000 in California. They made off with $200,000 worth of Muenster cheese in Wisconsin. They took rib-eye steaks valued at $82,000 in Texas.

Hughson Nut Inc. was a victim twice last year. It lost two loads valued at $189,000. Each time, people claiming to be truckers showed up. They had all the right paperwork to pick up a load of almonds.

On the Monday following the second theft, a customer called to complain that the almonds had never arrived in Arizona. A company manager remembered getting a sinking feeling. "Uh-oh. I think it happened again."

Few people know about the thefts. They are not often discussed outside the world of trucking. Companies that have had goods stolen don't usually want to talk about their losses. But crime reports and interviews with police and leaders show a scary pattern. The stolen goods raise prices and could put Americans' health and safety at risk.

## Hot Spots For Thefts In U.S.

In the end, the person buying the goods ends up paying for this, said Keith Lewis. He is the vice president of CargoNet. His company works to stop cargo theft. It gives information to insurance companies.

The cost of stolen goods goes beyond the cost of the products. There are health concerns with medicines and foods. If chicken goes bad and gets into stores, many people could get sick.

The thieves target mostly shipments of food and drinks, which are easy to sell illegally. They are also hard to trace. Some end up on the shelves of small grocery stores. Others go to huge warehouses.

The most common crime is still stealing trailers. But some say the new trucking scams are growing. Every day, three to five truckloads are stolen in the United States. Of those, at least one involves a fake pickup.

Cargo thieves steal from companies across the nation but there are hot spots. Places with shipping ports or railroads are popular. California has the most thefts. Large numbers have also been reported in Texas, Florida, New Jersey, Michigan, Illinois, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.

## Thieves Target Mostly Food

Some experts say that the Internet plays a large part in these thefts. The Web makes it easier for someone to pretend to be someone else.

Food and drinks were the most commonly stolen goods. They made up almost a fourth of all thefts last year. This was followed by metals, electronics and household goods.

One reason food shipments are popular is because they are cheaper than electronics or medications. Because of this, they are less protected. Food also does not usually have any identification numbers to trace.

The food loads are also difficult to find. Companies often do not know they have been robbed until their shipments fail to show up. That is usually four to five days after they were stolen.

But by that time, the goods have probably already been sold illegally.

Trucking and insurance companies are fighting back. They're urging people handling the shipments to take extra caution by checking information before giving goods to unfamiliar truckers. Another idea is to get a thumbprint from the truck driver.
