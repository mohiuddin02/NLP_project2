MEXICO CITY, Mexico — Tomasa Lopez hugged a new flat-screen TV in her arms. She had a huge smile on her face. The Mexican government had given her the TV for free as part of the world's biggest digital television giveaway.

"We have always wanted a digital television," said Lopez, a housekeeper. "We will see more channels. The kids will see cartoons."

Lopez was not the only one who got a free TV. Thousands of people were picking up new TVs from the huge tent where she got hers. Mexico has set up hundreds of giveaway centers like this one all over the country. The government is handing out 10 million free digital TVs to the poor.

Mexico is in the middle of a big project. The country is changing the way it sends TV signals. Old-fashioned TV signals will be replaced with new digital signals. Older TV sets will not be able to understand the new signals, so the old sets will not work anymore. The United States made the same switch back in 2009.

## Government Also Helps With Food

Jose Luis Rodriguez works for the government. He got one of the new TVs, but was still upset about the government saying that the TV sets were free.

"It is not free," Rodriguez said. "Stop using that word. It is paid for with our taxes," he said. The program will cost Mexico $1.6 billion, which is the same as $1,600 millions.

Mexicans can get a free TV only if they already get help from another government program. Some people who picked up TVs get food from a program called Prospera. Others get help from Liconsa, which makes milk cheaper. Programs like these are sort of like America's food stamps program.

Other nations have made the switch to digital television. Some of them gave away TV sets, too. Their programs were much smaller than Mexico's — and less expensive.

## Decoder Boxes Would Cost Less

The high cost of Mexico's program has left some people confused. Others are frustrated. Each 24-inch, flat-screen television costs about $145. Many people wonder why Mexico is not trying to solve the problem a cheaper way.

Some say Mexico should just give out decoder boxes. The United States used boxes like these when they helped people make the switch to digital TV.

People can hook the decoder boxes up to their old TVs. The boxes make it so the old TVs work with the new digital TV signals. Decoder boxes cost only about $40 each.

So far, the government has given away 4.6 million televisions. Delivering the TVs takes lots of workers and trucks. Workers have to make sure each family gets only one TV set. They have to check their names and fingerprints very quickly.

## Workers Hurry To Meet Deadline

The switch to digital TV will take place on Dec. 31. Right now, workers are handing out 30,000 to 40,000 TV sets each day. They need to work twice as fast. If they do not speed things up, they will not be finished by the time the old TV service is shut down.

Javier Lizarraga Galindo works for the free TV program. He says the new TVs will help people use less electricity.

Galindo says old-fashioned TVs use 320 to 340 watts of electricity. Using a decoder box adds 9 watts more. The new TVs use much less energy, said Galindo. They only need 40 watts.

Gabriel Sosa Plata is a TV expert. He does not think the TV program will save energy. In fact, he says people will probably use more electricity if they get new TVs.

Sosa Plata thinks that many people will not want to stop using their old TVs. He says they will probably move the old TVs into another room. They can just buy decoder boxes to keep the old sets working. With two TVs on instead of one, they will be using more energy than they did before.
