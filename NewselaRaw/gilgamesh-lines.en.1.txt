The Islamic State group has vandalized, bulldozed, exploded and looted shrines, temples and palaces built long before the beginning of Islam.

The Islamic State is an extremist group attempting to set up its own country governed by Islamic law. It has also been called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). The group's fighters have captured parts of Syria and some of northern and western Iraq.

## Smugglers Respond To "No Questions Asked"

The extremists, along with others, have illegally sold priceless, historic treasures from these archaeological sites on the international black market. The region has long been known as the cradle of civilization.

Yet amid this looting of antiquity, there is at least one heartwarming story. A museum in northern Iraq not only rescued a trove of artifacts from smugglers, but in the process of preserving the country's heritage, discovered something new.

According to Ancient History Et Cetera, a news site about archaeology and history, the Sulaymaniyah Museum in 2011 acquired a cache of 2,600-year-old tablets from a smuggler. The museum, located in the city of Sulaymaniyah, had offered a "no questions asked" policy to smugglers in the hopes of preventing Iraq's cultural heritage from leaving its borders.

## More Than History Beneath The Mud

Here is more from Ancient History:

"All of the tablets were, to some degree, still covered with mud. Some were completely intact, while others were fragmented. The precise location of their excavation is unknown." The researchers believe it is likely that they were illegally unearthed from what is known today as the southern part of the Babel - once called Babylon - or Iraq, which was formerly known as Mesopotamia.

But researchers examining the tablets soon realized there was one particularly exciting find. A tablet, in three fragments, was etched in cuneiform script, the writing system of ancient Babylon, with what appeared to be previously unknown lines from the Epic of Gilgamesh. Some consider the 4,000-year-old Sumerian legend to be humanity's oldest story.

The legend tells of Gilgamesh, the great king of Uruk, who journeys with his friend Enkidu, a semi-divine wild man, into the Cedar Forest to defeat the ogre Humbaba, the forest's guardian.

The Epic of Gilgamesh contains many universal themes. Among them are the arrogance of a hero, the fear of mortality and even a great flood, navigated by a voyager on an ark.

## The Epic's Lost Scenes

Translation work was done largely by two experts in ancient Babylonia from the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. They are Farouk Al-Rawi, a professor in the Department of Languages and Cultures of the Near and Middle East, and Andrew George, an associate dean, who recently translated the Epic into English.

The 20 new lines offer some new details and insights into the Epic. Ancient History described a few.

Gilgamesh and Enkidu saw monkeys in Cedar Forest, which was not mentioned in other versions of the Epic.

Humbaba emerges, not as a barbarian ogre, but as a foreign ruler entertained with music at court in the manner of Babylonian kings. The chatter of monkeys, chorus of cicada and squawking of many kinds of birds created a symphony that entertained Humbaba daily.

## Surprising Ecological Foresight

The new lines show that the Cedar Forest is a noisy abode of the gods. There is a curiously modern wrinkle, as George explained:

"Gilgamesh and Enkidu cut down the cedar to take home to Babylonia," George said. "The new text carries a line that seems to express Enkidu's recognition that reducing the forest to a wasteland is a bad thing to have done, and will upset the gods." Like the description of the forest, this kind of ecological awareness is very rare in ancient poetry, he added.

The Epic of Gilgamesh played a clearly prominent role in ancient Mesopotamia and was passed down over the centuries until it got buried and forgotten amid the ruins of the region's many kingdoms. The story was only rediscovered, largely by accident, by European scholars in the 19th century.
