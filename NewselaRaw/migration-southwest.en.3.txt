WASHINGTON, D.C. — The nation's economy continues to get better. There are more jobs and people are earning more money. People are also heading to Southern and Western states where they hope to find work and housing that they can afford.

The U.S. Census Bureau is a government agency that measures the population every 10 years. The Census Bureau is giving estimates halfway through the 2010-2020 decade. It says that between 2014 and 2015, more than 1 million people moved to the South. This part of the country is also called the Sun Belt because the weather is often sunny. It includes 16 states and the District of Columbia. 

During this time, the 13 states in the West also grew quickly. The states added just under 1 million people. 

People migrated to the South for many years before the Great Recession. This was a period between 2007 and 2009 when the U.S. economy was weak. Many people could not find jobs and had less money. Now that the economy is better, people are moving south and west again.

## Snow Belt's Population Growth Is Slow

In comparison, population growth remained slow in the Northeast and the Midwest, an area known as the Snow Belt. That population grew by just a few hundred thousand people.   

The numbers suggest that Americans are more willing to move now than they were during the recession. At the time, the Census Bureau said only 1 in 5 people who wanted to move somewhere else did so. 

A separate census report says two-thirds of the people who made long-distance moves between 2014 and 2015 were looking for jobs. They were also looking for more affordable housing. One-quarter of the people moved for family reasons, including marriage or joining relatives.

Texas had the biggest population gain from 2014 to 2015\. Other Sun Belt states that have seen a growth in population and jobs are Georgia and Nevada. Colorado, Oregon and Utah have done well too.  

## Florida Attracts More Seniors

West Virginia, meanwhile, suffered a population loss. Almost 5,000 people left the state. West Virginia relies on the coal business, which has not been doing well. The state has higher unemployment and lower job growth than the national average, which gave people more reasons to leave.

Six other states also had population losses for the year: Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Mississippi, New Mexico and Vermont. 

In Florida, the population grew by hundreds of thousands of people. Many of them were baby boomers, who range from 51 to 70 years old. Some are retired or want to live somewhere with nice weather. With the recession over, they felt more financially secure about moving south.  

The number of people in a state is important for government. The population affects how many lawmakers a state has in Congress. Each state sends a certain number of representatives to work on their behalf. Texas could gain three new lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives, Florida could gain two, and Oregon, one. 

Some states like West Virginia will lose a representative in Congress.

## California's Loss Is Oregon's Gain

In Oregon, many young people are moving to Portland. This is a big city where technology is big business. Josh Lehner is an economist who works for the state. He says there is not enough housing for all of the people who want to live here. 

Many of the people moving to Oregon are from California. They leave because housing in California is expensive. An average home in California costs two-thirds more than in Oregon, for example.

John Malson studies populations for California. He says the cost of housing limits the number of people willing to move to the state. This includes people who are offered high-paying, high-tech jobs in cities like San Francisco. 

"You have a very good job market here in tech, so people who are coming here are coming for the attractive job opportunities," Malson said. "But it's very expensive to live in California."
