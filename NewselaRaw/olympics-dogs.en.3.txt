SOCHI, Russia—The dogs are having their day in Sochi.

Packs of mutts roam the downtown streets. Dozens of them have shown up in the new mountain villages the Russian government has built for the 2014 Winter Olympics.

The most surprising story here this month is the pooch problem.

Free-roaming dogs are a global issue. But it has been spotlighted in Sochi because of reports that Olympic organizers hired contractors to kill at least 2,000 animals. That grim news helped fuel interest in protecting the animals, who hang around populated areas begging for food. Most of the dogs are friendly — which explains why a number of visiting athletes are trying to help.

"It makes me sad seeing dogs on the streets," said Brita Sigourney, a California athlete. She competes in ski halfpipe.

## Love At First Sight

Sigourney found two young dogs near the athletes village in the Caucasus Mountains, and well, it was love at first sight. She returned to the spot a few days later to check on her new friends, but only found one of the dogs.

"The workers around said the other disappeared," she said.

Sigourney wants to bring more than a medal back from the Sochi Games.

"I wish I could bring this puppy home," Sigourney said.

Many share that feeling. Silver medalist freeskier Gus Kenworthy plans to take five dogs home that he picked up on the streets.

"I've been around animals all my life," said Kenworthy, of Telluride, Colo. "It's hard to watch."

Amanda Bird, U.S. bobsled and skeleton press officer, also plans to bring home a pooch. You need two pieces of paper to bring dogs home: an international health certificate and proof of rabies vaccination. Her husband already has picked out a name: Sochi.

Kelly O'Meara works for Humane Society International. She said most dogs in Russia end up homeless because they are abandoned.

## Saving Street Dogs

The street dog population generally increases when more humans with food move into an area.

Sochi has grown a lot in the past seven years.  Thousands of workers came and brought dogs with them to guard the construction sites. But local people say the workers left without taking the dogs.

Dina Filippova lives in Sochi. The part-time lawyer quit a management job to lead a campaign to save street dogs.

"We have a lot of volunteers who rescue dogs and keep them in different places," she said.

Dogs have to be driven out of Sochi under the cover of night. They are taken to safe places where they can find good homes.

Filippova calculates that she has probably saved about 500 dogs over the past few years. She is keeping a handful in her apartment. She also has about two dozen more in short-term homes.

The city opened a shelter in the past month, but Filippova says that was done as a show for reporters.

## PovoDog

Nadezhda Mayboroda opened a private shelter called PovoDog. She said she has about 20 dogs there and is trying to expand.

She has been trying to get officials to build a permanent city-run shelter for five years.

"Still, nobody wants to help," Mayboroda said.

Bird plans to visit PovoDog on Monday to pick out which one she wants.

"I didn't come to Sochi with the intent of adopting a dog," she said. "But I couldn't ignore the presence of the stray dogs."

Bird dreams of someday owning enough land to build shelter to keep animals safe. She doesn't know if she will get a puppy home to Tennessee. Her airplane doesn't allow dogs, so Bird is hoping someone will bring the animal home for her.

Mayboroda, of the dog shelter, made it clear that strays are an international problem. They are not something found only in subtropical Sochi. But the mild climate along the Black Sea allows the dogs to live on the streets without many problems.

"Food is everywhere," Mayboroda said.

A friendly hound was hanging outside the door of a cafe in the Olympic Park on Sunday. The dog probably would have agreed.
