SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. â€” Hamlet Garcia climbed up the steps of a courthouse in Norristown, Pennsylvania, last year, wondering if he would be sent to jail.

Hamlet and his wife, Olesia, were about to go on trial for theft of services, an offense usually reserved for cable service thieves and restaurant bill dodgers. Their alleged crime: stealing an education for their 8-year-old daughter, Fiorella.

He was staring at possibly seven years behind bars.

Garcia, who came to the United States from Cuba when he was 18, remembers thinking one thing as he headed into the courthouse: "This isn't the kind of thing that happens in America."

## Parents' Crime: "Stealing An Education"

Their case is one of a handful in recent years in which families living in districts with failing schools have been accused of "stealing an education." Some have been heavily fined for lying about where they live on official district documents. Others have been criminally charged and, in some cases, jailed.

Civil rights groups say they are hearing that these severe measures may be on the rise. But nobody knows for sure how many school districts are cracking down on "education theft."

"I'm hearing about it more and more every year," said Gloria Romero, a former California state senator and parent activist.

## Rich Schools Versus Poor Families Of Color

The examples are many. And while perhaps extreme, they are worrying civil rights activists, parent advocacy groups and some local leaders. They say strict enforcement measures unfairly affect poor families of color. Poor families cannot easily pay their way out of trouble by paying back the value of their children's allegedly stolen schooling.

Jonah Edelman is the head of a national education advocacy group. He says the real crime is the difference in the quality of schools in rich and poor areas.

In the case of the Garcias, the father says that during the 2011-2012 school year, he and his wife had problems in their marriage and lived separately. During that time, his wife and daughter lived with his wife's father in Lower Moreland, Pennsylvania, a quaint suburban town. His daughter attended the district's much sought-after elementary school. There, she read picture books, learned the alphabet and made friends.

The local prosecutor, Risa Vetri Ferman, said Garcia and his wife were never truly separated. They always lived in northwest Philadelphia, where many of the schools are struggling, and lied to gain entry into the Lower Moreland schools, she said.

They "essentially stole from every hard-working taxpayer" who lives in the school district, Ferman said.

The couple agreed to pay nearly $11,000 to the school. Legal fees ran about $70,000. They are hoping to send their daughter to a private school.

This winter, the school district in Orinda, California, a wealthy town near San Francisco, made national headlines. Officials had hired an investigator to spy on the 7-year-old daughter of a local nanny suspected of living in another town. It was later discovered the girl lived near the school in the home of her mother's employers. She was allowed to stay in the school, after her mother agreed to make the couple she worked for official caregivers.

## A Year In Jail In Oklahoma

Boston public schools have a tip line for parents to expose students they suspect are lying about where they live. And a New Jersey district promises to give parents $200 for information that leads to a student being kicked out.

Groups that seek to protect parents say they are increasingly finding themselves advocating for parents who have been targeted by school districts.

In Michigan, parents convicted of providing false documents can be jailed for up to 20 days. In Washington, D.C., they can get up to 90 days for providing false documentation. In Oklahoma, the jail sentence can be up to a year.

"It's a 'gotcha' thing," said Gwen Samuel, the founder of the Connecticut Parents Union, which has helped to support a handful of families that have been criminally charged for education theft. "You see residency officers more than ever, and this practice of treating families like they've robbed a bank. It has become the norm to treat them like criminals."

## Parents Fight Back With Publicity

During her time as a state senator, Romero authored a 2010 California law. It permits parents of students attending one of a thousand California schools identified as poor performing to transfer their children into higher quality schools anywhere in the state, if there is space.

California's Department of Education does not keep track of how many families make use of the law, but Romero says many parents aren't aware of it.

"A lot of parents think they are trapped in these zones," she said.

Around the country, parent groups are fighting back by publicizing the cases and lobbying against jail time. The groups argue that school residency laws are unconstitutional because they treat parents in struggling school districts differently.

"The real issue is how do we provide quality schools for all children so parents don't have to make decisions that ultimately break the law," said Ryan Smith, director of The Education Trust-West, a foundation that works to improve schools in poor communities.
