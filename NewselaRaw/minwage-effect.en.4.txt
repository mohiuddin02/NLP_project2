By law, bosses cannot pay their workers less than a certain amount of money each hour. That amount is called the minimum wage. It is different in every state. The minimum wage in New York is $8.75. In Michigan it is $8.10. No state is allowed to pay less than $7.25. That is the law for the whole country.

Now some states want to raise their minimum wage to $15 an hour.

## Some Cities Raise Wages
<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20150608_MIN_WAGE.png" /> Some government officials and experts think a $15 minimum wage is a good idea. Right now a few people make a lot of money. Many others make very little. A higher minimum wage will help poor people. However, many business owners are against raising wages. They warn that higher wages will hurt businesses. The raise could force bosses to let go of some workers.

In fact, no one knows what will happen. Raising wages may not be as bad or good as people think.

More people are pushing for a higher minimum wage nowadays. Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles plan raises over the next few years. They want to raise the minimum wage to $15.

Some other cities have raised the minimum wage, but not by as much. At least a dozen other cities and states may raise the minimum wage a little too.

## Higher Pay For Poor Workers

Many workers are unhappy because their pay hasn't gone up in years. In the last 25 years a few companies and rich people have made large amounts of money. Everyone else has made very little.

Higher minimum wages would help make things a little more equal. Many poor Americans would see their lives get better.

About half of workers are paid by the hour. Government figures show that almost 6 out of 10 them make less than $15 an hour. That is about 44 million people. If the minimum wage went up to $15, those workers would see their pay go up.

## Prices May Rise At Stores

Millions of workers would have more money to spend. However, they might have to pay more for the things they buy. Shops, restaurants, and other businesses that pay workers little now would have to start paying them more. Then they might charge their customers more to make up for it.

Oakland's minimum wage was raised from $9 an hour to $12.25 in March. As a result, some stores added a dime or a quarter to the cost of different things.

Higher wages might actually hurt many low-paid workers. They could lose their jobs. Bosses may have to cut back on workers once they pay higher wages.

## Some Jobs May Be Lost

A government group did a study last year. They found that about 500,000 jobs would be lost if the minimum wage went up to $10.10 an hour. At $15 an hour, millions of jobs could be lost.

Some companies may fail. They may not be able to afford to pay their workers more.

Yet other businesses will do just fine. They will grow. If shoppers have higher wages they would have more money to buy what they want. That would mean companies sell more. Businesses would make more things to sell.

No one really knows how things will change. Still, the push for higher minimum wages is growing. Workers and bosses are already beginning to imagine life in a $15-an-hour world.
