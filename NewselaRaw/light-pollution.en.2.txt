SEATTLE — These days, most people never think to look up at the stars. And if they do look, chances are they won't see much. Most nights, the sky just isn't dark enough anymore.

Sixty-two-year-old Dave Ingram heads a local group dedicated to restoring dark skies. The sad truth, he says, is that there isn't much real night sky left. And that means people alive today will be the first in history to go through life failing to grasp their place in the universe. Because they simply have never seen the universe.

"You can put anybody — I don't care who they are — out under the stars for 30 minutes, and they start asking the big questions," Ingram says.

But it's more complicated than that. Even the small handful of people who do look up the stars find that the night sky — not that greenish-gray thing that passes for dark, but the ink-black, starry night sky — simply is no more.

## True Darkness Is Vanishing

In the old world, you walked beneath the stars nightly because you had to, and they became your compass, your friends, even your gods. In the new one, you don't because, well, you don't. Humans have been walking under the stars for about 2.3 million years. Only in the past 135 have most of us lost our connection with what shines above.

This is partly by choice, because "civilized" societies spend less and less time outside. But it's also partly unintentional.

Since the invention of the light bulb in 1879, light has been blasting darkness off the map. Today, Europe and virtually all of the United States east of the Mississippi River never falls into true darkness.

The western U.S. is following suit, with small pockets of the deepest black now limited primarily to the desert Southwest. Today, 99 percent of Americans never routinely see a true dark sky. And by 2025, experts say, they'll be lucky to have two or three places left where one even exists.

Light pollution is normal in most of the richer parts of the world, says Paul Bogard, author of "The End of Night."

## "Face To Face With The Universe"

Only now are we beginning to understand what this means. Light pollution, some scientists argue, has become a threat to our very well-being.

Environmental effects range from changes in how trees grow to the mass deaths of birds who once used stars to fly by. In our world today, the birds get confused by brightly lit buildings and fly into them. Up to a billion birds a year die in the U.S. alone.

If the effect on the natural world is that severe, what does the lack of true darkness mean for humans?

Studies suggest links between constant light and interruptions of the body's natural hormonal cycles. These disruptions may contribute to deep sadness and disease, including cancer.

Beyond that is the fear of how the loss of light affects our souls. It's a question that author Paul Bogard thinks about daily.

"I think it has huge implications to our spirit," he says. "For me, it's the difference between coming face-to-face with the universe and realizing your problems are just not that big — a real humility kind of thing. It's pretty easy, if you never see the universe, to think this world is all there is."

He added, "If you really see the night sky," you can't help but feel "awe and wonder and gratitude and spirituality."

## Bringing Back Starry Nights

It's a problem for us today, Bogard believes, but perhaps a greater one for tomorrow. Throughout history, a fascination with the universe has inspired art, science, and religion, he noted.

"And now," he said, "it's just gone."

Fortunately, light pollution can be reversed. But those fighting to restore dark skies have a tough barrier to overcome: modern human nature.

In society today, light equals progress. Lights have come to symbolize man's victory over the elements of nature. Along with that goes a strong belief that bright light means safety.

Ingram and other members of the International Dark-Sky Association keep such attitudes in mind. They argue that damage from light pollution can be contained, even reversed, without losing useful light.

"Nobody wants to go back to gas lamps," Ingram says.

Luckily, "full cutoff" lights provide a simple solution. These prevent rays from shooting upward, where they reflect off pollution in the air to create that yellow-green glow we often see in the sky.

Most lighting isn't designed that way. Among the worst offenders are the sort of glaring lights found in parking lots, backyards and gas stations and even some streetlights. Such lights could easily be modified.

"The technology exists to have a lot more control over our lights," Bogard says.
