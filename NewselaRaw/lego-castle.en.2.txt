SEATTLE, Wash. — Alice Finch's sculpture of Hogwarts Castle, inspired by the "Harry Potter" books by J.K. Rowling, is huge. It is shaped like an L, with each arm 13 feet long and 5 feet wide. It  is elaborately detailed, with multicolored bottles in the Potions classroom, mossy leaves bursting out of pots in the greenhouse and tiny framed art along the grand staircase. There is even a transparent ghost haunting the Ravenclaw Towers. It took her a year to build.

It is built entirely out of Legos. There are about 400,000 pieces.

Finch is a former middle-school teacher who lives with her family on Mercer Island, in Washington state. She is an AFOL, or Adult Fan of Lego. AFOLs call a Lego work a "build." Her Hogwarts build was featured at BrickCon 2012, the annual convention in Seattle for those who love Lego. It won Best in Show and the People's Choice award.

## Fictional Places On A Miniature Scale

The following year, she teamed up with fellow builder David Frank to create Rivendell. The build is a 200,000-brick model of the place where elves live in J.R.R. Tolkien's books. The result, so colorful and lush that it seems to have naturally sprung up from the earth, was also a prizewinner.

Finch, at home in her cozy, crammed-full Lego studio recently, said that she enjoyed Lego as a child. She did not make anything specialized until recent years. Her studio holds, she thinks, about 2 million bricks, all carefully sorted by color and size.

The Hogwarts build grew from reading the Potter books with her son, and from her longtime interest in architecture. Her father was an architect, and Finch said that she is always looking for architectural details while traveling.

"The difference between a great builder and an amazing builder is the level of detail," she said.

## Communicating In The Language Of Lego

Finch is featured in a recent documentary about Legos. According to the movie "A Lego Brickumentary," Lego is a global language. The same Danish company has manufactured the pieces since the 1940s. Generations have grown up with a bag of bricks on hand.

Finch said that the Seattle area is a thriving one for AFOLs. "It rains a lot," she said, and "there are a lot of highly educated," creative people. That lends itself to Lego, Finch said. She is a member of SeaLUG (Seattle Lego Users Group). The group has about 150 members, many of whom specialize in such areas as castles, space travel or robotics.

She is also part of a smaller local group called ArchLUG. This group specializes in Lego architecture and is currently working on a collaborative build for BrickCon 2015. The build is based on David Petersen's "Mouse Guard" books about the make-believe adventures of a mouse who lived 1,000 years ago.

Finch teaches Lego camps for children. She hopes that her visibility as a Lego master will inspire more girls to get creative with the bricks. When she first showed the Hogwarts build, she said, "people were confused and surprised that a woman had done this."

## From Love Of Building To Lego Master

Going public with her work, in the film and in public events like BrickCon, was not her original plan. "It's a creative process that I enjoy doing … not something I do for recognition," she says. Still, she knows that her visibility might be inspiring.

"If girls see a woman doing it," she said, "it plants the seed that they can do it."

Still, her favorite Lego buddies are her two sons, Thorin, 11, and Hadrian, 7. "We're always building together," she said, calling the pastime a "tremendous bonding experience with my kids." She and Thorin recently worked together on a colorful "How to Train Your Dragon"-inspired build, and Hadrian, as a 5-year-old, left his mark on Rivendell.

"He built a railway station in the middle of it, so the elves could come to work," Finch said.

As Finch's elaborate builds demonstrate, there's no telling what might happen when you combine a pile of bricks, the gift of space and time and a busy imagination. "Lego is kind of its own language," Finch said, adding, "You communicate by building together."
