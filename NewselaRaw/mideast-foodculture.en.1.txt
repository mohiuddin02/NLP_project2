RAMALLAH, West Bank â€” When Sari Sakakini opened his Orjuwan deli in Ramallah's well-to-do Masyoun neighborhood, he hoped it would be the start of a global chain of Palestinian restaurants. A year later, that hope has faded.

The shop's bright wooden shelves hold only a sparse collection of homemade sauces, olives and prepared soups.

"I want to put Palestinian food all over the world," Sakakini said. "But over here, it's just putting food on the table."

## Ramallah's Recipe For Frustration

Ramallah is the cultural and political center of West Bank Palestinian life. In recent years, it has seen many new restaurants, but unlike the best eateries in Beirut, Lebanon, or Amman, Jordan, Ramallah's food scene is barely simmering. It stews under a lid of a bad local economy, old-fashioned tastes and burdensome Israeli restrictions.

It's a frustration for Palestinian food professionals, and their distress is made worse by living so close to an Israeli food boom.

Skilled kitchen staff members are rare in a land with few cooking schools. Sakakini's head chef is a full-time schoolteacher, and there are no full-time Palestinian food critics or food magazines to encourage change. Peter Nasir, who had hoped his Azure restaurant would take off, recently lamented that  chicken chow mein was about as exotic as his customers would accept.

And for all the eateries, profits are thin. They are a reflection of double taxation on imported ingredients and the tiny number of customers shared by dozens of restaurants.

"Palestine is literally a forgotten corner," Sakakini said.

## A Love Affair With Israeli Food

The scene is much different in Israel.

Food lovers flock to Tel Aviv, named by Saveur magazine as an outstanding destination for cuisine in 2014. Israeli-born London chef Yotam Ottolenghi's cookbooks have each become global bestsellers. The Sabra brand of hummus, a mashed chickpea spread, is the official dip of the U.S. National Football League.

The international attention is just the icing on the cake because Israelis eagerly devour their own food as well.

"It's very emotional for me," Sakakini said of the global love affair with Israeli food. "It's the same kitchen."

Israeli food fuses Palestinian flavors to Jewish kitchens from around the world. Palestinian cooks trace their roots to countries around the Mediterranean Sea, be it Lebanese-Syrian recipes, Bedouin Arab dishes or prized specialties of the Turkish Ottoman Empire, which once ruled the area. A glance at Palestinian cooks inside Israel reveals its potential.

Celebrity chef Nof Atamna-Ismaeel recently conducted a cooking workshop at a cooking academy in Tel Aviv. A scientist who cooked at night until she won Israel's "MasterChef" in 2014, she is famous around Israel. Today she is a guest chef at the best restaurants and a frequent contributor to national food magazines.

This is all a distant dream for West Bank Palestinians.

## A Reality Check In Ramallah

Nasir studied computer science at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, and discovered his love of food while cooking for his roommates.

He returned to Ramallah, and in 2007 converted his family's stone home and shaded courtyard into a restaurant called Azure. When he opened its doors, Nasir planned a short menu highlighting local specialties, fresh ingredients and subtle foreign flavors. His enthusiasm was boundless; his customers' enthusiasm was not.

To stay in business, Nasir pared down his ambitions, and today he serves Palestinian standards like hummus and grilled meat along with hamburgers.

"When people are strapped for cash, they want something guaranteed," he said. "They don't want to spend their money experimenting."

Nasir's problem highlights the harsh realities of life in Ramallah. The average Israeli's annual salary is 10 times the average Palestinian's pay of about $3,000. A quarter of Palestinian workers are employed by their government, and when the national budget runs low, business slows down.

In addition to making far less money than Israelis typically do, Nasir's customers travel far less than Israelis and are not as used to new things. Because of long-standing conflicts between Israelis and Palestinians, most West Bank and Gazan Palestinians are not allowed to enter Israel or use the Tel Aviv airport. Travel abroad via Jordan is possible but time-consuming, and even driving between Bethlehem and Ramallah within the West Bank can take hours because of roads that make a large circle around Jerusalem in Israel.

Nasir, who can travel freely in Israel, said his favorite restaurant is in Tel Aviv in Israel.

"I'll spend the same amount of money (as I would in Ramallah) and enjoy eating from a chef in a proper place which is actually creative and doing different things, not the same typical food," Nasir said.

On his way back to Ramallah, Nasir buys Heinz ketchup and mayonnaise outside Tel Aviv to avoid paying both Israeli and Palestinian taxes on imported goods.

## Priming The Palestinian Palate

Despite the limitations, Palestinian cooking is not without its fans. "The Gaza Kitchen" cookbook, published in 2013, won praise for its recipes of spicy seaside cuisine.

East Jerusalem chef Johnny Goric is finalizing the courses for a $500,000 cooking school he plans to open in Ramallah in September. It will train students in local recipes and international techniques.

At Orjuwan, co-owner Sakakini said Goric's school would be a lifeline. He said managing and training staff to use state-of-the-art equipment like a steam oven has taken all his time.

"Our cuisine is rich, but it has to be better presented and upgraded," Sakakini said. "We're not missing anything."
