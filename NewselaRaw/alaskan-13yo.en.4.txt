ANCHORAGE, Alaska â€” It is spring break in south-central Alaska. Many middle school students spend it playing video games or skiing. Grayson Davey is an eighth-grader. He is 13 years old. He spent most of the week looking for people to work for the company he owns.

Grayson's company is called Alaska Paracord Designs. He makes bracelets or bands for the wrist. He also makes keychains.

## His Bracelets Can Save Lives

In three years, Grayson has sold $40,000 in bracelets and keychains. He makes these products from paracord. Paracord is tough cord or string. It is used for parachutes. Grayson braids the cord to make the bracelets. They may look like other ones for sale. His bracelets are different. His bracelets can save lives.

In an emergency or accident, the bracelet can be taken apart. The strong cord can be used to set up a shelter like a tent. The cord can make a bandage. There is also a whistle built in. It can be used to call for help. The fire starter bracelet has 17 feet of cord. Inside the bracelet are small tools. The tools can be used to make a fire.

## Accident Inspired His Idea

Grayson got his big idea after an accident. When Grayson was 11, a family friend was on a boat that flipped over. The man and his young daughter fell into the water. They swam to an island nearby. All their stuff was lost. They could not build a fire. They could not make a shelter. After three days, the man and his daughter were saved.

Grayson thought a paracord bracelet could have helped. He thought the useful tools inside could save lives.

## He Owns The Company

Three years later, Grayson has his own company. He has sold more than 1,000 of his bracelets. He sells them over the Internet and in local shops. Over spring break, Grayson found two people who may start working for him.

"I want to grow the company as big as I can," he said.
