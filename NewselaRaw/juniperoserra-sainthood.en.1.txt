Junipero Serra, the Spanish priest who founded missions up and down California, will become a saint in September, Pope Francis announced Thursday. Serra's sainthood has been controversial, supported by Catholics but strongly opposed by Native American groups.

"He was the evangelizer of the West in the United States," the pope told reporters. Serra helped bring Christianity to California in the 1700s, yet critics say he helped in the mistreatment of Native Americans by the Spanish, who ruled California at that time.

For Catholics and some other Christian groups, a saint is a holy figure, someone who lived a good life that can be an example to others.

## Just One Miracle

The pope made his announcement after visiting Sri Lanka, where he canonized, or declared, that country's first saint.

The ceremony to officially declare Serra a saint, his canonization, may bring the pope to California during his scheduled trip to the United States this fall.

While the Catholic Church usually requires that saints need to have performed two miracles, Serra will be canonized as a saint even though the church says he performed only one miracle. Serra, who is buried at the Carmel Mission in central California, is a holy man who has already been considered a saint for centuries, Pope Francis explained.

Becoming a saint in the Roman Catholic Church is a long process with multiple steps. Serra was beatified in 1986, and at that time the church established his first miracle — that prayers to him cured a nun of lupus in St. Louis. Lupus is a disease that can cause skin rashes and more serious symptoms.

## Native Americans Point To History

Native American groups have forcefully opposed Serra's road to sainthood, saying the native Californians who built the missions were forced into labor and often punished harshly. Many Native Americans put to work by the Spanish died of European diseases, including chicken pox and measles, because they had never been exposed to them before, and had no immunity.

Valentin Lopez is one Native American activist who is disappointed by the pope's decision. He is chairman of the Amah-Mutsun Tribal Band of Coastanoan/Ohlone Indians. Lopez would like the Vatican, the headquarters of the Catholic church in Rome, to re-evaluate Serra's sainthood.

"Pope Francis is from Argentina and knows the history of the New World," Lopez said. "But maybe he thinks it's more important that he brought Christianity to the New World than what happened to the native population. Maybe the end justifies the means."

## Colonialism Was At Fault

Elias Castillo, who recently wrote a book about the treatment of Native Americans at the California missions, says Californians have lived a "horrible lie" when it comes to their views of Serra. The priest's statue stands at all California's 21 missions, as well as at the state Capitol building.

"I'm astounded. I couldn't believe the pope was doing this. There was an attempt to canonize him in the '40s and '50s, and that was stopped cold by the Indians. I think there will be protests," said Castillo, whose book is called "A Cross of Thorns: The Enslavement of California's Indians by the Spanish Missions."

Castillo said it was outrageous that the Catholic Church, which has apologized for how the Indians were treated, would now "canonize one of their great monsters."

But a member of the Ohlone tribe, Andrew Galvan, said he is extremely happy to hear of Serra's upcoming sainthood.

"I'm ecstatic," said Galvan, who is the curator of Mission Dolores in San Francisco and whose ancestors were baptized at the missions. Galvan does not deny the poor treatment of Native Americans at the missions, but he does not blame Serra. He blames colonialism — the Spanish and other Europeans coming to the New World to take advantage of the natural resources, like gold and silver, and the native people.

"You can't change the past, and we all acknowledge mistakes were made in the past," Galvan said. "The bottom line is I believe Junipero Serra was a very good person in a very bad situation, which I call colonialism."

## Question Of Legacy

Pope Francis' announcement surprised many who thought the opposition by Native American groups might delay Serra's canonization forever.

History professor Robert Senkewicz of Santa Clara University, which was founded by Serra in 1777, believes the controversy has largely calmed since Serra's beatification in the 1980s.

"Thirty years ago, the lines were really tightly drawn between people who supported Serra's beatification and people who didn't. It was very intense," said Senkewicz, who co-authored a biography on Serra.

So what will Serra's legacy be? Will he be known for the poor treatment of Native Americans or for his role as a Catholic missionary spreading the faith in a new land?

"St. Francis of Assisi was known for nature. St. Thomas Aquinas for intellectual scholarship. Mother Seton in the U.S. is known for devotion to the poor," Senkewicz said. "The niche of Serra is giving up a very, very prosperous life in Spain for a difficult missionary life."

## From Missions To Sainthood

Making Junipero Serra a saint raises another question: will he be considered California's first saint or an American saint?

California was under Spanish rule and not yet a U.S. state when Serra, who was born in Spain, died in 1784. He had spent 30 years building the first nine missions before dying at the Carmel Mission, which was his headquarters.

There are more than 10,000 saints. Only 12 were either born in the United States or did their good works here. There is another Californian on the path to sainthood: Cora Evans, a devout Catholic who lived quietly in the Santa Cruz Mountains and died in 1957. She was declared a "servant of God" by the Vatican in 2012, one important step to sainthood.

Pope Francis did not specify the date or place for Serra's canonization ceremony. The dates are not official for his trip to the United States, either, but he is expected to visit in September.
