Dance classes might be big on fun, but a new study says they're surprisingly light on exercise.

A medical journal called Pediatrics reports that only 8 percent of kids enrolled in after-school dance programs are getting enough exercise during class to meet federal guidelines for moderate to vigorous physical activity. For adolescents, that number is only 6 percent.

Researchers from San Diego State University and the University of California, San Diego, used accelerometers to study 264 local dance students. Girls wore the devices around their waists while they took beginning or intermediate classes like ballet, tap, jazz and hip-hop. The devices tracked how much time the girls spent in motion and how brisk that motion was.

None of the seven dance genres tested provided a solid 30 minutes of meaningful exercise. That after-school activity goal was established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which recommend another 30 minutes of exercise during the school day.

## For Kids, Hip-Hop Comes Out On Top

Some dance classes missed that mark by more than others. For instance, kids ages 5 to 10 averaged only six minutes of moderate to vigorous activity during a 50-minute Spanish flamenco dance class. In ballet, kids recorded 14 minutes of challenging physical activity within a 49-minute class. Jazz and partnered dance classes (like ballroom, swing and merengue) provided 22 minutes of exercise whether they lasted 40 or 53 minutes.

Hip-hop classes came closest to meeting the CDC guidelines, offering 27 minutes of significant physical activity over the course of a 50-minute session.

When researchers looked at which classes provided the best ratio of activity to rest, hip-hop came out on top again. About 57 percent of each hip-hop class counted as meaningful exercise. Flamenco ranked worst in this category, with only 14 percent of each class spent dancing vigorously.

## For Tweens And Teens, Ballet Is Best

For dancers ages 11 to 18, results weren't much different. Ballet had the best showing, with almost 17 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity during a 55-minute class. Hip-hop was a close second, with almost 16 minutes of real exercise during a 50-minute session. Flamenco came in last once again, providing only four minutes of exercise over a 44-minute period.

Classes for adolescents were judged to be equally bad. None of them required students to exert themselves more than 31 percent of the time.

The movement study highlighted that dancers in the 11- to 18-year-old group wound up getting less exercise than the younger students did. This was especially interesting since the older students' classes were usually longer and more advanced.

Researchers speculated that, compared with younger kids, adolescents might be spending more time standing around in class while they learn new routines. It's also possible that the accelerometers were capturing younger dancers' extra movements, such as fidgeting while waiting in line.

## To Prevent Obesity, Team Sports Outdo Dance

Overall, the study determined that dance classes delivered much less exercise than after-school sports. Although both soccer practices and dance classes required kids to stand around about 30 percent of the time, an additional 28 percent of a soccer practice involved vigorous activity, the type that is most effective at preventing childhood obesity. For dance classes, that number was only 7 percent.

Similar studies have found that 50 percent to 100 percent of kids in sports programs meet the CDC's 30 minute exercise goal. In the study of dance programs, fewer than 10 percent of kids met that goal.

That's a shame, the study's authors wrote, because dance classes often appeal to girls who are not interested in sports.

"The public health promise of dance classes is not being delivered," they concluded.
