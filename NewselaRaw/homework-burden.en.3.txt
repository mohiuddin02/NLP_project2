PITTSBURGH â€” Two common complaints parents have about homework are as far apart as can be: One is that there's too much homework, and more of it than ever before. The other is that there's too little.

Education expert Tom Loveless says more parents think there is too little homework. However, those complaining there's too much homework often get most of the attention.

News stories about children with too much homework are real, he says. However, such cases are not common.

"The homework load has been pretty stable" over the last 30 years, he said.

## Three Different Amounts

However, the amount of homework can be very different from school to school.

Take these three Pittsburgh public school students:

Imani Downing is a sophomore at Pittsburgh Perry High School. She said she rarely gets homework and usually in just one class.

"I feel like we should have homework in every class," she said. That would allow for "more learning" and "a better chance to understand things."

Amma Ababio is an 11th-grader at Pittsburgh Allderdice High School. She is taking advanced classes this year. Ababio figures she does homework from about 5 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. on school nights. She said her phone is off, and her computer is off unless she needs it for schoolwork. She even does homework while she eats dinner.

"I have homework in every single class," she said.

Jermalle Johns is a sophomore at Pittsburgh Obama 6-12. His workload is somewhere between that of the other two. He figures that on schooldays he spends "maybe an hour on homework tops."

He doesn't think the homework helps because he learns from paying attention in class. "I get it done because it's another grade that helps me get an A."

## Too Little Homework?

Loveless based his report on three surveys: a student survey, a survey of parents and students, and a survey of college freshmen.

The 2012 college freshmen survey asked students about their last year of high school. The questions weren't only about homework. Students were also asked how much time they had spent doing other things, such as how much time they spent hanging out with friends or playing sports.

Nearly two-thirds said they had spent six or more hours a week socializing with friends. But only about two-fifths spent that same amount of time on studying or homework. And homework not only came in behind socializing. It also trailed exercise or sports, and working for pay.

Back in 1986, the fraction of students who spent at least six hours a week on schoolwork was larger: one-half said they had.

When he shows his study results to college professors, Loveless said, "they gasp and they all nod their heads." Most of the professors already "thought there was a problem."

The problem that concerns them is not too much homework, but too little: High school seniors, at least, seem to be doing less work than they used to, which makes them less prepared for college.

## "The Bottom Line"

The 2012 NAEP survey gathered information about homework differently. It asked students how much time they had spent on homework the night before. The survey looked at three age groups: 9-year-olds, 13-year-olds, and 17-year-olds.

In all three age groups, more than a fifth had no homework at all: That was true of almost one-fourth of 9-year-olds, about one-fifth of 13-year-olds, and more than one-fourth of 17-year-olds.

For most age groups, the 2012 numbers were close to results in 1984. The only real difference was with 9-year-olds. In 1984, 35 percent of 9-year-olds said they hadn't had any homework the night before.

In 2012, though, more than half of 9-year-olds who did have homework had less than an hour's worth. Just under half of thirteen-year-olds also had less than an hour and more than one-fourth of 17-year-olds had that amount of work.

The fraction of students with more than two hours of homework seems not to have changed much. It was almost the same in 2012 as it was in 1984.

In 2012, very few 9-year-olds reported they had more than two hours of homework. The same was true of  13-year-olds. A little more than one-tenth of 17-year-olds said they had more than two hours of homework.

"The bottom line," Loveless says, is this: The "homework burden" does not seem to be growing.
