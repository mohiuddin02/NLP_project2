The race to become the next president of the United States is on. Next fall a Democrat will face off against a Republican in the general election. Right now, the two groups are holding contests to pick the person who will run next year. The first contest is known as the primary election. Democrats are running against other Democrats, and Republicans are running against other Republicans.

Most voters belong to one of the two groups, or political parties. During a primary they can only vote for a candidate from their own party. A candidate is someone who is running for office.

## First Debate For The Democrats

The Democratic candidates held their first debate Tuesday night. Debates allow candidates to argue with each other in front of an audience. Tuesday's debate was shown on TV and was watched by millions of people.

On Tuesday the candidates each tried to say why they would be the best choice for voters. The candidates also pointed out how their opponents were wrong about certain things.

The top three Democratic candidates are Bernie Sanders, Martin O'Malley, and Hillary Rodham Clinton. Right now Clinton is in the lead, and Sanders is in second place.

On Tuesday the candidates argued about many things. They argued about guns and about the war in Iraq.

## Hourly Pay Was Not A Big Topic

They skipped one of the main things they do not agree about, though. They hardly talked about the minimum wage.

The minimum wage is the lowest amount of money bosses are allowed to pay their workers. Right now the national minimum wage is $7.25 an hour.

Sanders, O'Malley and Clinton all believe the national minimum wage should be raised. They do not agree on how much it should be raised, though.

Sanders and O'Malley both want to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Many people around the country would like to see the minimum wage raised to that level. They are pushing hard to get it to happen.

Clinton agrees the national minimum wage should be higher than it is now. However, she has not said how much she thinks it should be raised. During Tuesday's debate no one pushed her for an answer.

## A Pay Raise Would Help But Not If It's Too High

Clinton might have good reasons for not supporting the $15-an-hour goal.

Many studies have shown that raising the minimum wage helps workers. However, those studies looked at small increases in the minimum wage. A new $15 national minimum wage would be a huge increase. It would more than double the amount bosses must pay their workers.

If the minimum wage is set too high there could be problems, experts say. Businesses could find it too expensive to hire new workers. They might simply stop hiring new people. They could even decide to let some of their workers go.

Some experts say a $15 minimum could do more harm than good. It could make finding work harder for many people.

## Pay Should Be Based On Where People Live, Clinton Says

Clinton also says it does not make sense for the minimum wage to be the same everywhere in the country. It is cheaper to live outside of a city than in a city. For that reason Clinton feels the minimum wage should be lower outside of cities too.

No one really knows for sure what would happen if bosses had to pay their workers $15 an hour. Some experts say it is at least worth a try.

Many Americans are struggling to make enough money to support their families. For them, a raise in the minimum wage would be a big help. Voters like that might choose O'Malley or Sanders over Clinton if they knew how the candidates differed.

Oddly, O'Malley and Sanders did not talk about the minimum wage during Tuesday's debate. Perhaps they should have asked Clinton what she thinks the new minimum wage should be.

Some people watching Tuesday's debate might have gotten the wrong idea. They might have thought Clinton agrees the national minimum should be $15 an hour.
