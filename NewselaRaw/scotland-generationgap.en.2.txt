GLASGOW, Scotland â€” At Scottish dinner tables, families are arguing over whether Scotland should become an independent country. There's a generation gap: younger voters are more inclined to back independence and older voters tend to want to remain in the United Kingdom.

Scotland is voting on Thursday on whether or not it should separate from England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Support for staying in the United Kingdom is strongest among people over 60. They worry about what will happen to their health care and savings if Scotland breaks free. Scottish retirement savings are held in pensions. Health care is provided by the National Health Service. Both are handled through the U.K.

The pro-independence movement is largely being driven by the under-40s.

## Running Neck-And-Neck

The Yes and No camps are neck-and-neck in the polls. The rival campaigns have called on supporters to make a last-minute attempt to swing the vote by persuading family members.

The Yes camp is urging young people to visit their parents and grandparents to explain why they should support separation. The No camp is asking seniors to win young hearts and minds with their wisdom.

"I was so proud of my grandpa when he told me he was voting Yes that I burst into tears," said 23-year-old Miriam Brett, a campaigner for Generation Yes. "A Yes vote means so much to my generation. We want to let all our grandparents know that their future is secure in our hands, and with a Yes we can build a better future for ourselves and for our children."

The No camp is trailing in the polls in every age group except the over-60s. More than 63 percent of the over-60s are expected to vote in favor of staying in the UK. And older people are more likely to be registered to vote. So there has been a huge drive to get younger people engaged in the Yes campaign.

## Voter Turnout Could Be High

Interest in the vote is sky high. A total of 4,285,323 people, or 97 percent of people old enough to vote, have registered to vote on Scottish independence.

Voter turnout could be more than 85 percent. Just 64 percent voted in the 2010 U.K. election.

Among the voters are 124,000 16- and 17-year-olds. They will be voting for the first time. Many of these new voters are expected to support independence. Generally, older voters are more likely to actually cast their votes, though. That could help the No campaign.

First Minister Alex Salmond described the Generation Yes campaign as "inspired." He said young voters now have a great excuse to visit their grandparents' house for a traditional Sunday lunch.

However, polls suggest that as many as 40 percent of families are divided over the vote. And at least 20 percent say the debate has led to heated family arguments.

"My Dad stopped talking to me when I said I was going to vote Yes," said 21-year-old student Laura Brown. "He even blocked me as a friend on Facebook."

## "Remind Your Children And Grandchildren"

The No camp says older voters have a wealth of experience to pass on to the younger ones.

"Scotland's 1 million pensioners should use their vote and their voice to remind their children and grandchildren of how the National Health Service and pensions were secured by the power of working together," said former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Born in Scotland, Brown once ran the U.K. and is a major figure in the effort against Scottish independence.

"I urge you to use both your vote and your voice to remind your children and grandchildren of suffering endured together, sacrifices made together and achievements earned together with friends, neighbors and relatives in England, Wales and Northern Ireland," Brown said. "Tell them how we fought and won two world wars together."

It's a message that appeals to older voters.

"They haven't lived long enough to see what we have," said Liz Mullen, a 68-year-old retired office worker.

"A lot of young people think independence is going to be some sort of miracle cure," she said. "They think it is some kind of adventure without any risks, but this is not a video game."
