MIAMI â€” Americans won't choose a new president until 2016, but the election race has already begun. Men and women running for president will spend the next year and a half trying to convince Americans to vote for them.

The first step is to announce that they're running. On Monday, Marco Rubio took that step.

Rubio is a young Republican senator from Florida. He is already well-known, even through he is just 43 years old. On Monday, Rubio promised that he would make big changes as president.

He said that Americans who were ready for something new should vote for him. During his speech, he stood in front of a banner that said "A New American Century."

## Stressing His Youth

Rubio's speech came just one day after Hillary Rodham Clinton announced that she is running for president. She is expected to be difficult to beat.

Clinton is running as a Democrat, while Rubio is running as a Republican. The two parties will each elect a single candidate. The winners from each party will face off in 2016.

In his speech, Rubio contrasted himself with Clinton. She has been in government for many years. Rubio is more of a newcomer. He said voters who are not happy with how government has been run may want to vote for someone with a new approach.

Rubio is also compared with Jeb Bush, another person who may run for president as a Republican. Bush used to be governor of Florida.

Both Clinton and Bush are linked to past presidents. Clinton's husband Bill was the 42nd president. Bush's father was the 41st president and his brother was the 43rd president.

With their family ties, Clinton and Bush are linked to old ways of doing things in Washington. Rubio argued that he is different.

"Too many of our leaders and their ideas are stuck in the 20th century," he said. "The time has come for our generation to lead the way toward a new American century."

"Just yesterday, we heard from a leader from yesterday who wants to take us back to yesterday," he said, speaking about Clinton. "I feel that this country has always been about tomorrow."

## Keeping The American Dream

Rubio also spoke of his background. He is the son of a bartender and a maid. He described his success as an American Dream come true.

Rubio said that the American Dream, the idea that anyone in America can be successful through hard work, was slipping away from many Americans. He suggested that he could convince voters to believe in the American Dream again, and could help make it easier to achieve.

Many of Rubio's supporters were on hand for the announcement. They began lining up in 87-degree heat three hours before the public kickoff at Freedom Tower. The Tower has a lot of history, especially for Rubio, whose family is Cuban. It was the first stop for tens of thousands of people fleeing Cuba in the 1960s and 1970s.

Fifty-year-old Kelly Steele and her 18-year-old son were in the crowd. They wore Rubio T-shirts.

"We have had a lot of Bushes," Kelly Steele said. She felt that Rubio would bring needed change.

## A Tough Race Ahead

Democrats don't support Rubio, of course. Hours before his rally, Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz criticized Rubio, arguing that he would not bring the change he was promising.

"He's a follower," she told reporters. She suggested that, as president, Rubio would offer the same old ideas.

Rubio faces a long road the presidency. Clinton is considered to be difficult to beat, and if Bush enters the race, he is likely to be a tough challenger as well. Because both come from famous families, they'll be able to raise a lot of money for their campaigns.

Others who have announced that they are running include Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky.

Both Cruz and Rubio are Hispanic, and if one of them is elected, he will make history as the nation's first Hispanic president.
