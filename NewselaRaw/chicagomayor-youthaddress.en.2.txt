CHICAGO — Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel took the oath of office to begin his second term Monday. He took the unusual step of focusing his inaugural address on a single issue: The lack of opportunity facing the city's disadvantaged young people.

The mayor decided to home in on one of Chicago's most troublesome problems. However, he barely mentioned the city's money problems. The city's pension, or retirement, plans do not have enough money in them. Pension plans provide money to public workers, such as teachers, police and firefighters, when they are no longer employed, either because of retirement or disability.

The pension problem will take up much of Emanuel's time in the coming weeks. He will be working to persuade state lawmakers to stretch out increases in pension payments and push for a city-owned casino to help bring in more money to the city.

Second inaugural speeches tend to be trickier for politicians than the first. The first time, the formula often is to highlight an agenda heading into office. For many, the second time around features a mixture of touting accomplishments while listing what is important for a second term. Emanuel's decision to draw attention to a single issue is not usually done.

## Mayor Of Two Chicagos?

However, the mayor chose to focus on the lack of opportunities for youths in many of the city's minority neighborhoods. By doing this, Emanuel took on one of the top criticisms lobbed at him during the campaign: that he's a mayor who has perpetuated two Chicagos — one for the wealthy and one for the rest.

And so the mayor talked about the city's troubled youths. He described them as children who live in poverty, fail to receive a proper education and can turn to a life of crime.

Emanuel said in his speech that it is "too often ignored in our civic conversation. It is ignored precisely because it is so hard to talk about." He then said he wanted to "shine a spotlight on preventing another lost generation of our city's youth."

Emanuel listed a number of programs he said had made a difference for kids from low-income families, and pointed to examples of students who have overcome such situations.

That included the story of Marcus Norris, who was sitting in his house as a 9-year-old when a "gunshot came through the window and knocked out four of his teeth."

For the next nine years, the mayor said, Norris was too embarrassed to smile until he entered the Becoming a Man program. There, his counselor Timothy Jackson gave Norris confidence and raised money to get the student's teeth fixed.

"Marcus was able to smile for his high school graduation photo. And he will be wearing a big smile at his upcoming graduation ceremony at Fulton High School this summer. His dream is to enter a college (cooking) program and one day become a chef," Emanuel said.

## Briefly Talks About Money Problems

Still, Emanuel said, much more has to be done.

"The faces of these lost and unconnected young men and women are often invisible — until we see them in a mug shot as the victim or the perpetrator of senseless violence," Emanuel said. "Their existence is avoided rather than confronted."

Heading into Monday's speech, much of the focus had been on Chicago's money problems.

Both the city and Chicago Public Schools face $1 billion debts. The Illinois Supreme Court decided this month that the retirement pay the public employees have been promised may not be reduced. This threatens two pension deals Emanuel has negotiated, and also makes it difficult for Emanuel to make new pension deals with public employees.

The court ruling led Wall Street agencies to downgrade Chicago and Chicago Public Schools debt ratings, with one calling it "junk." It means that the agencies expect that Chicago will have a harder time paying back the money it owes, or its debt.

Emanuel also is faced with coming up with a new contract with the city's teachers to avoid a strike.

The mayor didn't mention most of that Monday. He touched on the city's money problems only briefly at the beginning of his speech.

Alderman Scott Waguespack noticed. He is a frequent Emanuel foe on the City Council. He said that it was a "nice speech," but Emanuel failed to mention the pension and money issues. He said he is worried that Emanuel hasn't come up with anything yet.

## "We Will Work Harder"

Alderman Joe Moore said he, too, found the speech surprising, "but in a good way."

The problems young people in Chicago face could be an equally if not more important challenge than money problems, said Moore, an Emanuel ally. He said he thought it was appropriate as summer approaches and violence often becomes more common.

Former President Bill Clinton attended the ceremony and drew a slightly louder ovation than Emanuel.

Emanuel briefly mentioned that the city had made progress on schools, safety and money. The rest of Emanuel's address dealt with Chicago's children. The mayor, however, did not offer much in the way of new proposals to address the many problems with crime, money and education in Chicago.

Instead, Emanuel tried to use his speech to set the problem as a prime concern for the entire city.

"Over the next four years, I will do everything in my power to spark hope in the eyes of every Chicagoan," Emanuel said. "We will work harder than ever to restore trust where it is broken and opportunity where it is lost. But today I challenge every citizen of this great city: You must do your part."
