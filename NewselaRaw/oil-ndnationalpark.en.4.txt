THEODORE ROOSEVELT NATIONAL PARK, N.D. — The park is named after Theodore Roosevelt, U.S. president from 1901 to 1909.

Roosevelt was a war hero, boxer, cowboy and hunter. He was also famous for working to protect natural areas.

He visited North Dakota in the 1880s to hunt buffalo. He also lived in the area as a rancher.

Valerie Naylor fell in love with Theodore Roosevelt National Park more than 40 years ago. She was a teenager, visiting from Oregon with her parents.

She promised that she would come back, and she did. Naylor volunteered and did research in the park.

Today, Naylor is in charge of the park. The national park covers 70,000 acres in North Dakota.

Visitors come to Theodore Roosevelt National Park for the natural sounds, fresh air and beautiful views.

He visited North Dakota in the 1880s to hunt buffalo. He also lived in the area as a rancher for a time.

## A Lot Of Oil Wells

Naylor is standing at Oxbow Overlook, looking out over hills, trees, and the river shimmering below.

The park is "a very special place," she said. But it's in danger. "It's so vulnerable."

The lands around Theodore Roosevelt National Park have a lot of oil.

North Dakota is in the middle of an oil boom — companies drilling oil in the state are making a lot of money. The state government is making money too. Many people are becoming rich.

Today, North Dakota has more than 11,000 oil wells. About 60,000 more could be built. The drilling will continue for at least 20 years.

## At The Fence

It's Naylor's job to make sure the oil drilling doesn't hurt her park. Many projects have been coming closer.

"There's so many things going on so quickly. It might be a pipeline, power line, oil well, or new road," Naylor said.

Naylor drives her car through a beautiful area. She points to a fence. It's the border of the park.

A company wanted to build an oil pump near the fence. Naylor wrote a letter to the company, asking it to move the project.

Eventually, after months of paperwork and discussion, the company agreed to move the pump.

Naylor and others want to protect the park's quiet and solitude.

They want the sound of blowing wind and singing birds, not the hum of engines. They want the darkness of the night sky, not the flares of oil drilling.

## Visitors Love The Park

Deb Hornfeldt and Debbie Virnig were visiting the park from Minnesota.

Hornfeldt said spending time in nature helps her relax and feel less stressed.

"It's really important to have places like this," she said.

"Natural spaces are getting smaller and smaller," Virnig added.
