### PRO: A pullout is the wrong move

WASHINGTON — Henry Kissinger used to be U.S. secretary of state and he won the Nobel Peace Prize. By all measures, he's a heavyweight in the world of international relations. At a recent gathering, he stood — peering commandingly over his signature thick, black-frame glasses — and remarked:  "Withdrawal is not victory."

He was referring to the U.S. decision to pull its military out of [Afghanistan](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Afghanistan).

Kissinger knows a thing or two about the pain of walking away. He negotiated the Paris Peace Treaty that ended the Vietnam War. Then he watched on as Congress pulled the plug on all support for South Vietnam in its war against North Vietnam.

America's 25-year effort in Vietnam was wasted. The North Vietnamese rolled over the South, with the support of the Soviet Union, our former enemy. Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia were engulfed in brutality and widespread killing. The Soviet Union, a group of republics controlled by Russia, was strengthened. It supported new revolutions in South America and Africa. The Soviets fostered a wave of Islamist terrorism across the Middle East.

Many Vietnam War protesters see America's withdrawal as a triumph. But, there is no reason to be proud of how we left. We can still debate the wisdom of going to war there. That our total abandonment of our allies left a bloody and shameful history is not in doubt.

Kissinger's comments weren't meant to bring up ancient history. He was complaining about history repeating itself. The prospects are now high that Afghanistan will fail … needlessly.

## Further Commitment Still Needed

The Obama government's Afghan plan is a near copy of its withdrawal from [Iraq](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Iraq). It has decided that the Afghan government appears that it won't fall apart. So, now it's OK to head for the exit. But just because the government isn't in danger of immediate failure doesn't mean that we can declare victory. It's no better than when George W. Bush declared "mission accomplished" just after invading Iraq.

That's not to say that the United States should plan major, unending commitments to a country after a fight. But once the levels of violence have come down, some further commitment is usually necessary. The U.S. may need to stick around to help peace and safety become normal and let a strong government take root.

Iraq is a case study in how to get it wrong. It is absurd to argue that the White House could not have gotten permission to keep a small force there. It simply didn't want to. It is also clear that the U.S. pullout left space that was eagerly filled by al-Qaida as it regained its strength. Today, Iraq suffers much higher levels of violence than when Obama took office.

The prospects for Afghanistan are even grimmer. Obama's Afghan "surge" of sending additional troops to wipe out al-Qaida did not nearly have the same effect as the Bush surge in Iraq. In certain areas of Pakistan, the Taliban can still operate freely; the Haqqani Network of Islamic rebels is as strong as ever and al-Qaida is waiting for its moment. Terrorist attacks against the government are paid for by an illegal drug trade that is still going strong. These are daunting challenges for the Afghan people.

Obama talks of finishing the job in Afghanistan. Yet, many in the government would be delighted to have no U.S. troops there, period. But it's not clear that a small army of troops from other countries will be enough to hold the hard-won gains there.

The U.S. went to war in Iraq and Afghanistan to crush the terrorist forces that had killed thousands of Americans on Sept. 11, 2001. Those terrorists threatened to kill many, many more. Job 1 was not to bring freedom and justice to those lands. But America always prefers to leave a path to liberty in the wake of its wars.

Sadly in the case of Afghanistan, Obama seems ready to repeat the mistake he made in Iraq. Future U.S. governments will be affected by the chaos we leave behind and will have to deal with it — probably at greater cost. "Withdrawal is not victory."

### CON: Don't blame withdrawals for problems left behind

COLUMBUS, Ohio — Our military's exit from Iraq was filled with problems, just like our planned withdrawal from Afghanistan. We have found ourselves dealing with new governments in both these countries that are not doing as we think they should. But, the withdrawals are not the reason for that.

We are learning a hard lesson. Our military can remove an existing government. However, we cannot decide what will replace it. It is a lesson with importance for the future. In recent days we are hearing new rumblings that the U.S. may possibly get involved in the civil war in Syria.

President George W. Bush ordered the invasion of Iraq in 2003, but it seems he gave little thought to what might replace the government of its leader Saddam Hussein.

In 1991 his father, President George H.W. Bush, attacked Iraq after it took over Kuwait. Some in Congress urged him to expand the operation to attack Iraq's capital city, Baghdad, and remove Saddam Hussein from power.

Wisely, he knew that such action would create many more problems. Under Saddam Hussein, the Sunni community held the power. Sunnis are a minority within Iraq who follow one kind of Islam. The majority Shiite community practices a somewhat different type of Islam, and they were resentful over their treatment at the hands of Saddam Hussein.

It was not difficult to see in Iraq that any new government there would likely be led by the Shiite community. Since they are the majority, free elections would naturally give them the lead. Then there was the chance the Shiites might seek justice for their suffering. There was always the chance that would leave the country in chaos.

Now we see current Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki beginning to favor the Shiites. That is the result of the situation we set up with our invasion of Iraq in 2003.

The Sunni in Iraq are reacting now with violence. Whether we are there with troops or not, that difficult relationship between Sunni and Shiite is playing itself out. Fighting between Sunnis and Shiites breaks out daily in Iraq.

We should have known that a Shiite-led government in Iraq would be on good terms with the government of Iran. Iran is a majority Shiite country, with a Shiite government. We have have had very poor relations with Iran since the country had a revolution in 1979. With a Shiite government in Iraq, the government of Iran has grown stronger.

## Made Both Countries A Shambles

In Afghanistan, we removed the Taliban, a government that ruled under a extremely strict form of Islam. Afghanistan is home to a variety of ethnic groups. It has no history of a government with control over the entire country. Before the Taliban, different warlords controlled areas of the country.

Now the warlords who ruled small fiefdoms in Afghanistan are making a comeback. One of them may wind up as the next president in elections to be held soon. We are having trouble convincing Hamid Karzai, the current president, to let our troops remain in large numbers past the end of 2014.

Both our military invasions of Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003 could have been avoided. In Afghanistan, we demanded that the Taliban turn over Osama bin Laden. The Taliban was beginning to respond to our demand, but instead we invaded.

In Iraq, there was even less reason to send our troops. We invaded because, we said, Iraq was preparing powerful weapons to use to attack us. That reason was quickly shown to be highly unlikely.

So in both Afghanistan and Iraq, we took military action that could have been avoided. Our invasions had predictable effects that damaged both those countries and ourselves.

And this does not include the thousands killed or wounded among our own forces. Thousands of Afghans and Iraqis were also killed or wounded.

Now we have to live with the political situation in both Iraq and in Afghanistan. We are leaving both countries in shambles. If we don't like the governments we see, we have no one to blame but ourselves.
