KANSAS CITY, Mo. â€” Jake Betts tugged the reins of his horse named Leroy. He guided Leroy to the top of a hill.

On Betts' saddle was a coil of rope.

Meet the modern-day cowboys and cowgirls.

The cows are scattered across a field. For the last four months, the animals have munched on grasses. Betts and 10 others will round up almost 1,100 cows.

These cowboys and cowgirls use cellphones and computers. But they follow the ways of the Old West. They wear long sleeves even in the heat. They wear pointed-toe boots. Their jeans are always blue.

Men, women and children round up the cattle on horseback. They don't use pickup trucks like many ranchers.

## Cowboy Traditions Never Die

For more than a 100 years, "we've been talking about the disappearing cowboy," said James F. Hoy. He is an expert on Kansas history.

But "cowboys are still out there," he said. "They don't carry a pistol anymore in their holster. Now, it's a cellphone."

The ranch is about 125 square miles and has 40,000 cows.

Holton Nelson is a cowboy. He is now 15. He has helped herd cattle since he was 4 years old. To herd the cows, Nelson helps guide them where they need to go. They will be fattened up and then turned into food.

Three generations of the Nelson family have herded cattle on horseback.

Older brother Nate learned about ranching at college. "But what we're doing, you're not going to learn out of a book."

Jade Cole is 16. She rose at 3:30 in the morning to help out. Other cowboys also arrived for the roundup.

The riders take their places, and their horses start moving at an easy trot.

"Epp! Epp!" says Ryan Gasche as he tells the cows where to go.

"Ryan's a yelper," Betts says.

## Horses, Cattle Pick Up The Pace

At 7 a.m. the horses move faster. The cows break into a jog. It's as if the cows are hurrying to the pens.

"I'm 51 and been doing this since I was 18," Gene Ernest says. He likes the friendship it brings, he says.

The cowboys herd the cattle into pens. From there, the cattle go to the feedlot. The animals will eat and gain weight there. When they get to about 1,200 pounds each, they will be killed for their meat.

These cowboys and cowgirls like their job. Some say they understand cows better than people.
