BEIJING — Search and rescue teams looking of the missing Malaysia Airlines plane have found no signs of the airliner – only garbage.

The teams have discovered what oceanographers have been warning — that even the most far-flung stretches of ocean are full of trash.

For the first time since the search focused on the southern Indian Ocean 10 days ago, the skies were clear and the sea was calm. The good weather has allowed ships working off the west coast of Australia to retrieve the "suspicious items" spotted by planes and on satellite pictures.

But none of the items proved to be debris from the missing plane. They were just the ordinary garbage that swirls around the ocean.

## Another Lost Flight Recalled

"A number of objects were retrieved by HMAS Success and Haixun 01 yesterday," reported the Australian Maritime Safety Authority in a statement Sunday. The objects were described as fishing equipment and other garbage.

The disappointing results demonstrated the difficulty of trying to find out what happened to the Boeing 777. Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 disappeared March 8 during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing, China. A total of 239 passengers and crew were on board.

Australian authorities said Sunday that a naval support ship, the Ocean Shield, will depart from Perth on Monday with a "black box detector" supplied by the U.S. Navy. The detector is called a Towed Pinger Locator 25. It carries a device that should be able to detect the plane's black boxes in waters as deep as 20,000 feet. The boxes record pilots' conversations and flight data.

The search team is in a race against time because the black box's battery lasts only 30 to 45 days. The odds are stacked against finding it in time without a trail of debris to guide them. Based on an analysis of the flight's path, investigators guess the flight crashed into the Indian Ocean. The information comes from plane engine data transmitted via satellite.

The most famous example of a missing plane is Air France Flight 447. The Air France plane crashed over the Atlantic on a flight from Rio de Janeiro in Brazil to Paris in 2009. It took two years to find the body of the aircraft and the flight recorder, even though pieces of debris were found within five days.

## "Needle In A Garbage Patch"

The southern Indian Ocean is one of the most remote places on the planet, far from any islands, shipping lanes or flight paths. But the area accumulates a surprisingly large amount of garbage, trapped in the spiral of slowly rotating currents.

"In addition to foul weather, administrative bungling and the vastness of the search area, the search for MH370 has been compounded by one other factor: the incredible amount of garbage already floating in the search area — and in oceans worldwide," Marc Lallanilla wrote on the website livescience.com. Lallanilla, a science and environmental consultant and writer, called the search for Flight 370 a "needle in a garbage patch."

The lack of debris has prevented families from achieving any kind of closure over the deaths of their relatives. Chinese families, in particular, have rejected the statement of the Malaysian government that the plane crashed with no survivors.

"We want evidence, truth and dignity," read banners that Chinese relatives held at a demonstration at a Kuala Lumpur hotel on Sunday.

Malaysia Airlines said Sunday that it will fly families of passengers to Perth and will set up a family assistance center to provide counseling and logistical support. But the airline said it will do so only when confirmed wreckage from the missing flight has been found.
