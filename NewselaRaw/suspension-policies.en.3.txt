DALLAS, Texas â€” Ahmed Mohamed is a 14-year-old student from Texas. He is very good at building things. Last month, Ahmed was removed from class and arrested.

It happened because of something Ahmed brought with him to school. His teacher thought it was a bomb that could explode. Actually, it was just a clock.

Ahmed built the special clock himself. He was proud of it and wanted to show it to people. His teacher did not believe him. The police were called, and Ahmed was arrested.

His arrest got attention all over the country. Many people thought the school treated Ahmed very unfairly.

In the end, the police said Ahmed had not meant any harm. He even got invited to the White House.

## Student Clockmaker Forced To Stay Home

However, Ahmed's school still suspended him. He was forced to stay home for three days. Since then, his parents have taken him out of the school.

The way Ahmed was treated certainly seems unfair. In part, what happened to him had to do with his school's rules. His school has very tough rules about how student misbehavior should be punished.

In the 1990s many U.S. schools added tough rules. Because of those rules, students had to be punished quickly and toughly when they misbehaved. Schools were also supposed to call the police if there was any chance someone could get hurt.

Now, many schools have decided those rules were a mistake. They have started using a new set of rules. When kids misbehave, these schools no longer automatically suspend them or kick them out. They also try not to call the police.

Instead, teachers or other grownups at the school talk to the students. They try to figure out what is making students misbehave. Sometimes they realize the students were not misbehaving at all.

## Denver Schools Relax Rules About Punishment

In 2008, schools in Denver, Colorado, began using the new rules. School leaders were worried that too many kids were being suspended or kicked out of school. They were particularly worried that black and Hispanic students were being treated unfairly.

In Denver, black and Hispanic students were being punished more than white students. Many were being suspended or kicked out of school. A white kid who did the same thing often would not be punished as much.

Margarita Atencio was one such student. Atencio is Hispanic. She said her Denver school suspended her in seventh grade. It happened after other girls beat her up, then blamed her for the fight.

When Atencio returned to school, she was very worried she would be attacked again. She was, and this time she was kicked out of school for good.

Atencio had to repeat the seventh grade. "I thought since nobody was on my side that nobody cared about me," she said.

Things eventually got better for Atencio, though. Not long ago she graduated from high school.

## More Students Stay In School, Learn To Solve Conflict

Things have certainly changed in Denver too. Around 11,500 kids were suspended the year before the new rules were introduced, and 167 were kicked out. Last year, only around 5,400 students were suspended. Just 55 were kicked out.

White students are still less likely to be punished than black or Hispanic students. However, the difference is no longer as big.

Before the change, students who got into fights were suspended. However, nothing was done to figure out what was bothering them. Now, instead of just being suspended such students meet with a teacher or other grownup.

The students are given a chance to explain why they were fighting. Then, everyone sees if they can work out their problems.

In the end, far fewer students have to be punished.
