MUMBAI, India — Squatting on a low wooden stool, Sayed Mehboob adjusts his faded red turban. On this patch of sidewalk near Mumbai's Grant Road train station, modern India hurries by.

Young laborers with rough hands set off on lunch break. Packs of students race to after-school tutoring sessions or home to play video games. Upper-class housewives emerge from air-conditioned sedans with leather seats.

## Look For The Red Bandana

Unfazed by the din, Mehboob, 45, slides a smaller stool toward a visitor and flashes an inviting smile.

"Would you like me to clean your ear?" he asks.

It seemed an unusual request, particularly on the busy, fast-paced and less-than-clean streets of India's commercial capital. Who in this city has time to stop and get his ears cleaned? And who would think of having it done on the street, by a man with a battered leather bag full of unmarked bottles dangling from his shoulder?

Yet swabbing dirt and wax out of people's ears has been Mehboob's business for more than two decades. Amid the snack sellers and cobblers, a few hardy kaan saaf wallahs, as ear cleaners are known in Hindi, still dot the sidewalks of Mumbai. They are identified by the red handkerchiefs tied around their heads.

## A Time-Honored Profession

A young man in an orange plaid shirt approaches Mehboob, who motions toward the empty stool. Gaurav, a 21-year-old housekeeper here for his occasional cleaning, sits down stiffly, like a boy in a dentist's chair.

Mehboob props his bag of tools on one leg. He pulls out a steel pin the length of a pencil, wraps the tip in a wad of cotton and guides it toward Gaurav's aural canal.

In Mumbai, a city of more than 12 million where seemingly no job is too small, many of the last remaining traditional ear cleaners hail from southern India. Some trace the profession to the 18th century.

Mehboob, who was born outside Hyderabad, learned the trade when he came to look for work in Mumbai 25 years ago, when it was still known as Bombay. After he had labored in construction for a few years, a fellow southerner taught him how to clean ears.

## "A Soothing Effect"

"It was just something to do," he says. In the crowded city, with vehicles and construction sites fouling the air with fumes and dust, getting one's ears professionally cleaned was "a normal practice," he said.

Mehboob charges 20 rupees, or about 30 cents, for a standard cleaning of both ears with cotton and hydrogen peroxide. The process takes less time than a good shoeshine. The deluxe treatment can include daubs of lotion, coconut oil and a dark liquid that Mehboob described as an ayurvedic tonic, and costs 50 rupees, or 80 cents.

"That's if the ear is inflamed, or if it's really red," he says. "The lotions provide a soothing effect."

His method is to dip the cotton-tipped pin in hydrogen peroxide and scrape the outer ear canal before proceeding to the inner canal. An old pair of tweezers helps pick out stubborn bits of dirt and wax.

## Mixed Reputation

A routine day brings about a dozen customers, he says. For long stretches he sits alone in front of a former phone booth, its rusted doors padlocked shut. In the late afternoon, he moves farther down the road, hoping to catch commuters disembarking from a train on their way home.

It is unlikely that most young people who pass him on the street know what he does, or recognize the meaning of the red turban. Most of his regular customers are elderly, he says, although they are loyal, some even summoning him to their apartment for house calls.

"Rich people," he says proudly.

Mumbai's ear cleaners have a mixed reputation. Foreigners tell stories of being accosted near the Gateway of India monument by red-turbaned men waving needles. With the arrival of cotton swabs and a move toward obsessive hygiene, the trade seems destined for extinction.

## The Unsung Of Mumbai

In a decent month, Mehboob saves around $80 after deducting the little he pays for rent. He shares a room nearby with 15 men — day laborers, taxi drivers, security guards — most of them migrants, all Muslims in a staunchly Hindu neighborhood.

They are the unsung of Mumbai, the people who run the basic machinery of the city — and then there is Mehboob, a fading relic in every way.

He owns nothing of value here, not even a cellphone. He deposits his earnings with a broker instead of in a bank, preferring to carry his savings back to his hometown when he returns every few months to visit his family and their tiny plot of farmland.

Yet Mehboob has trained his nephew, so there could be at least one more generation of ear cleaners in Mumbai. He dismisses the word of doctors who advise patients with earaches not to visit men like him, warning of infections and scrapes.

"Of course the doctors say that," he says. "It's good for their business."
