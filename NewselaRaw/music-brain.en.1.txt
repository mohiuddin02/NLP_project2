Everyone dislikes some kind of music, but are there people out there who just don't respond to the emotional content of any music? In other words, are there people who simply aren't moved by the music that hits others in the heart?

Apparently, yes, and they weren't lying when they said so, according to a study published online Thursday in the scientific journal Current Biology.

This finding grew out of the efforts of a team of researchers from Spain and Canada. They were trying to develop an accurate questionnaire to measure people's sense of reward from music. To their surprise, they found that roughly 5 percent of the people they studied reported getting no pleasure at all from music.

So they followed up by testing 30 more people, grouped by their relative liking for music. The bottom group, which expressed the least pleasure in music, also exhibited the least emotional response. These people showed little emotion even when they listened to pieces they had chosen themselves. The scientists measured emotional responses by watching changes in heart rate and skin conductivity, or sweat, when listening.

"They were not just saying so, but the physiological responses were in accord with what they were saying," said the study's lead author, psychologist Josep Marco Pallares.

## Amusia And Anhedonia

There are people who can't process music well. About 4 percent of the population has amusia, characterized by an inability to recognize melodies to famous songs or tell if musical notes are out of tune. Others suffer from general anhedonia â€” a pronounced inability to experience pleasure. General anhedonia is particularly found in people who suffer from depression and neurodegenerative brain diseases, such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's.

But is there a separate musical anhedonia? The study suggests there may be.

None of the participants showed signs of general anhedonia, nor did they exhibit significant differences in their sensitivity to rewards, according to the study. All did well at categorizing musical passages as happy, sad, scary or peaceful, according to the study. And they reported no differences in their levels of pleasure when it came to things other than music.

The only thing that matched up well with the subjects' heart rate and levels of sweat was their score on the Barcelona Music Reward Questionnaire. This rates such things as music-seeking behavior, use of music to regulate mood, whether music was a shared social experience, and other factors.

The study suggests that musical enjoyment is not as universal as commonly assumed.

Marco said the results could help the team refine musical therapies for stroke victims, which had initially sparked their interest in the brain's reward response to tunes. But they could also be applied to other therapies as well, such as treating anhedonia, he said. Anhedonia is a key aspect of major depressive disorders, and is common among those with Parkinson's disease.

## An Eclectic Music Mix

In the study, 13 pieces were drawn from responses to a poll of 200 people whose background makes them similar to those studied. The set list skewed toward well-known classical pieces such as "Spring," from Vivaldi's "Four Seasons," and the Puccini aria "Nessun Dorma."

"Most of them are very well known classical pieces," Marco said. "The list was not as original as we expected. We expected more pop music."

Also making the list was the musical theme to the 1992 Summer Olympic Games, "Barcelona," composed by Freddie Mercury, who recorded a duet version with Montserrat Caballe.

Subjects were asked to bring several chosen pieces, Marco said. So-called hyper-hedonic people, characterized by high music appreciation, brought in what could only be described as an eclectic mix. Artists with multiple cuts included Carlos Santana, Paco de Lucia and Beethoven; Pink Floyd, Deep Purple and Genesis were wedged in among Beirut, Rihanna and movie score composer Clint Mansell, the former front man for Pop Will Eat Itself.

"I would say it was less typical," Marco said of the mix.

The task of selecting a handful of pieces proved difficult for those with little emotional connection to music. "They were really having trouble bringing music in, and some of them asked family and friends to give them music," Marco said.

Besides some Beethoven and the themes to "Pirates of the Caribbean" and "Superman," the musically indifferent chose the Verve, Franz Ferdinand and Moby.
