The B-2 bomber is one of the most advanced planes in the U.S. Air Force. It is a huge plane that can carry more than 20 tons of bombs and is almost undetectable by radar. The Air Force has only 20 and each one cost more than $2 billion to build.

On Feb. 26, 2010, a B-2 attempted to take off from Guam, a Pacific Island south of Japan, for a routine training mission. Then, a fireball flashed from a left engine, starting a fire that heavily damaged the interior of the airplane.

Although the damage to the plane was bad, the Air Force decided that it could be saved. That was good news because the Air Force had already lost a B-2 when one crashed and burned in 2008.

The military said it couldn't afford to lose another. The repairs required more than 1,000 parts ranging in size from small clips to massive sections that support the structure of the aircraft. The project took nearly four years, and cost more than $105 million.

## Calling In The Techs

The B-2 bombers were originally built at Northrop Grumman's 45-acre factory in Palmdale, Calif., behind razor-wire fences under tight security. The first B-2 was completed in 1988 and the last one in 1997.

So when the Air Force decided to rebuild the plane on Guam, it looked for experts from Northrop. It called in the mechanics, engineers and other technicians from the company who know the bomber best.

Sean Byrne, a Northrop mechanic, was told that he'd be going to Guam to work on the B-2.

"I had no idea where Guam was," Byrne said. "I had to look it up on a map and saw this tiny dot in the middle of the Pacific."

In May 2010, Byrne and five other mechanics flew to the island to look at the aircraft, which was sitting in a hangar. There appeared to be very little damage to the B-2's smooth dark-gray surface.

But then the workers looked at the plane's innards. "The extent of the damage was surprising," said David G. Mazur, a Northrop vice president. "Hundreds of parts would have to be replaced."

## Getting Hard-To-Find Parts

On Guam, Northrop determined it would do the repair in two phases. First, the crew would perform the mechanical repairs — estimated at $67.9 million — that would enable the B-2 to fly to Palmdale. Once there, the aircraft would undergo a complete rebuild at a cost of about $37.2 million.

Byrne, along with many other workers, toiled seven days a week for months at a time to restore the stealth bomber.  They spent so much time working on the island, they started calling their temporary home "Guamdale."

To rebuild the bomber, workers needed parts that were difficult to find. Some parts were found on shelves at air bases in the U.S.

Parts that were no longer made had to built again based on blueprints. Those blueprints were drawn when mechanics such as Byrne were in elementary school.

All that attention to detail paid off and the plane, named Spirit of Washington, started right up on the first attempt.

## "Made It Back Home"

Mechanic Tom McElhaney, 28, was in Guam when the bomber took off. "Seeing it leave the island was emotional. It brought a tear to your eye to see it disappear over the horizon."

Back in the U.S., Byrne noticed a black dot flying just above the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains early one morning.

He knew what it was. So did the other Northrop workers surrounding him. They were waiting on this windy runway at the company's plant in Palmdale to see the aircraft nicknamed "Lazarus" — the plane that died in a fire on the island of Guam only to be brought back to life to fly home.

The dot grew larger and larger. Suddenly, the one-of-a-kind bat-winged shape of the B-2 stealth bomber came into view. As it touched down for a landing, the crowd erupted in applause, hugs and tears.

"After all that time, it finally made it back home," Byrne said. "In some ways, we couldn't believe we pulled it off."
