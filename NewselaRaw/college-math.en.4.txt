CHICAGO â€” Kelsey Pearsall-Brandon wants to be a police officer. But one thing stands in her way.

Math.

Kelsey is a student at a community college in Illinois. She did badly on a basic math test. So she must take a special math class to catch up. If she doesn't pass, she won't finish college. And if she doesn't finish college, she can't be a police officer.

But will she ever use advanced math as a police officer? "Not really," she said.

## Big Problem For Students

More than half of college students are behind in reading and math. They must take special make-up classes. These make-up classes can cost a lot of money. They don't have much to do with real life. They also can be hard. Not many students in these classes ever finish college.

Experts say these make-up classes don't work.

Some experts say the classes should be changed. Students need to learn a more useful kind of math.

Some colleges are trying a new strategy.

The strategy is called math literacy. Teachers teach math skills that students need for work. Teachers spend less time on skills students won't use.

## Making Math More Real

Katy Almy teaches math literacy at a college in Illinois. She uses stories about real life. For example, she may ask students to figure out a food bill. She then shows students how to find the answer.

Almy said real problems are easier for students to understand and work with.

Verenice Sandoval is 18. She is in Almy's class. She uses this kind of math every day. So, it's easier to understand.

Not all experts think math literacy will work. Many students come to college with little math skills. Others can't read well.

Almy hopes to make math more real for students.

Regular math classes treat them like they want to be doctors, Almy said. "Not everyone's going to be a doctor."
