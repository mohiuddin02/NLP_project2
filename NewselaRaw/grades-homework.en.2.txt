ST. LOUIS — Parents at Lincoln Elementary School in St. Charles, Mo., thought their children were a shining example of academic achievement.

Then they got state test results.

Despite their glowing report cards, most of the students failed. Administrators knew they had a problem.

What they did next changed everything parents, teachers and students thought they knew about grading.

## A Different Approach

The school joined a national movement that is changing how students are graded.

This new way of looking at schoolwork moves away from rewarding students just for completing work. No longer are there points for finishing homework assignments, or for good behavior and class participation. Instead, grades are based on exam results and the quality of work.

"There are kids that are good at playing the game of school," said Julie Williams, principal of Lincoln Elementary in Missouri. "If you don't ever do well on tests, but you raise your hand every time, those kids can score well in the traditional system. But when they are tested on a state tests, it exposes the weaknesses."

Critics say the approach may sound good. Who doesn't think grades should be based on what kids are actually learning? But what that means in the classroom is another matter, they say.

Take, for example, not counting homework in a student's final grade.

Under standards-based grading, points aren't taken off if a student fails to turn in homework. Instead, homework is seen as something to help the students understand a subject, and they can redo assignments multiple times and even retake tests.

The changes go against how schools have worked for generations. And it has triggered fears from parents who worry their kids would simply slack off if they don't have to turn in their homework.

When new grading policies were explained to middle school parents this year, their jaws dropped.

"It was 45 minutes of gnashing of teeth," said parent Paul Bozdech. "The general mood of the room was, 'This isn't how I had it growing up.'"

## What Do Grades Really Say?

Over the last 15 years, schools have been focusing on student growth in learning. Many have adopted a new set of standards to measure that growth. In the last few years, nearly all states have adopted the [Common Core](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Common+Core), an outline of what a child should know and be able to do in each grade.

The new standards uncovered gaps like the one at Lincoln Elementary. This has led educators to question what grades were really saying about students.

"High school is free; if you fail in college, you have to pay," says Ken O'Connor, a former teacher who is now an author.  "We don't do kids any favors when we inflate their grades because at some point, they are going to fall on their face."

At the heart of standards-based grading is the idea that students should be graded on how well they know a subject, not the work they do.

Advocates of the idea say traditional grading can mask academic failure. A student might earn a D grade. But because the student got points for handing in homework, that student may earn a B or C in the class. Likewise, students who earned straight A's may be forced to take special courses in college, because they don't know the material.

Some parents and teachers are worried about the lack of penalties or immediate consequences for not doing homework.

"That's not real life," Bozdech said.

When Ethan Dobbs heard that students would be able to retake parts of their Algebra tests, he almost couldn't believe it. Also, homework wouldn't be included in the final grade.

"I realized immediately it was going to be a little bit different," he said.

Some kids "kind of abused" the homework policy, Dobbs said. But most of the students soon understood that if they didn't do the work, they probably wouldn't do well on the test.

## Homework Is Still Important

For teachers, the shift away from traditional grading can be scary. Even teachers who like the new ideas say that homework is important. They notify parents if work is not complete or they don't let students retake tests until they complete the assignments. A few schools even make students stay in during recess until missing homework is finished.

A local high school teacher said that future employers will expect work that is done well and turned in on time.

"Parents trust that schools are preparing their children for life after high school," the teacher wrote. "We are letting them down."

But Becky Stevenson, an English teacher, says her students really have a desire to learn.

"They can practice without penalty," she said. "We're seeing a change and it's pretty powerful."

Tom Guskey, a University of Kentucky professor, doesn't have information to show if the new way of grading helps students learn more.

But that doesn't matter, he said. Grade reform is about letting parents and teachers really know how students actually are doing.

Since the change, Lincoln has moved from the bottom of the district in its performance on state tests to the top. In 2013, 71 percent passed reading and 80 percent passed math — double the percentage from 2010.

Williams says standards-based grading played a big role in the leap.

"It's just been very powerful," she said. "It's clear to us this is what's best for kids."
