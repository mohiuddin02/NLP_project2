In a video released Tuesday, the president and his wife announced that the library will be built on the city's South Side. No decision has been made yet whether it will be built in Jackson or Washington parks.

"All the strands of my life came together and I really became a man when I moved to Chicago," the president said in the video, which showed him seated with his wife. "That's where I was able to apply that early idealism to try to work in communities in public service. That's where I met my wife. That's where my children were born."

## First Lady "Thrilled" For Her Neighborhood

First lady Michelle Obama, who was born in Chicago, said she was "thrilled to be able to put this resource in the heart of the neighborhood that means the world to me. Every value, every memory, every important relationship to me exists in Chicago. I consider myself a South Sider."

The Barack Obama Foundation is in charge of the project. In a statement, it said it would get input from universities, leaders and organizations as it sketches out its plans for the library.

For more than a year, the University of Chicago had been engaged in a fierce competition with three other universities for the library. They were Columbia University in New York, the University of Hawaii and the University of Illinois at Chicago.

The University of Chicago has pledged to help build the library. The foundation also said it plans to work with the three other universities. It said it plans to explore and develop a long-term relationship with Columbia.

## President's Project Will Include Hawaii

"In addition, the foundation will work with the state of Hawaii to establish a lasting presence in Honolulu," the foundation said.

The University of Chicago had long been considered the most likely school to host the library. However, its proposal to build the library on the South Side became caught up in a battle over the use of parkland. Some people in Chicago did not think that a public park should be used for the private library.

The plans to announce the library in March were delayed until after the April 7 election for Chicago's mayor.

## 13 Places Competed To Host The Library

In late April, several news organizations reported that Chicago had been selected to host the library.

The selection ends a yearlong competition that began with 13 proposed sites.

Although Obama was born in Hawaii, he taught a law class at the University of Chicago for about 12 years, and first lady Michelle Obama used to help run the school's hospital. Chicago's South Side also was where Obama started his political career as a state senator in 1996 and where the first lady was born.
