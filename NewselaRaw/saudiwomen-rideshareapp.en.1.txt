RIYADH, Saudi Arabia â€” When Hala Radwan returned to Saudi Arabia with a business degree from France, she found a job in the marketing department of a big international company. There was just one problem: How would she get to and from work in the only country in the world that does not allow women to drive?

Saudi Arabia offers little choice in mass transit. Hiring a chauffeur was very expensive and she didn't want to deal with the negative comments she would face if she tried to hail a cab. In Saudi Arabia, traditionally, a woman using public transportation on her own is often seen as lacking morals.

"It was a nightmare," she said.

Friends tipped her off to a solution: Uber and a regional competitor called Careem.

## Driving Independence

Smartphone-based ride services like Uber and Careem are becoming increasingly popular in Saudi Arabia's major cities, especially among the large number of tech-savvy young people. Customers include foreign businessmen who don't want to deal with the country's sometimes confusing taxi system. But more than 80 percent of individual users are women, the app companies say.

The apps have increased the ability of women to move around freely and become more independent. Otherwise they have to rely on a male relative to ferry them around in the country that believes in a strict form of Islam. However, with the prices starting at about $5 a ride, even supporters of the apps admit that it is not a solution for the poor.

Radwan, 29, spends nearly $700 a month on rides from Careem.

The cost is slightly higher than for a taxi, but she finds the apps safer and more reliable. Both Uber and Careem use GPS technology to track their cars. With a few taps, she can see who will be driving her, the type of vehicle he uses and his customer ratings.

Better still, no one can tell she is not using a private car.

## User Numbers Growing Like Crazy

At least four ride-booking apps are available for download in Saudi Arabia, with more said to be in the works. While the technology is the same as that used in the United States or Europe, there are some important differences in approach.

None of the companies work with drivers who use their personal cars to ferry passengers for cheaper prices than a taxi or limousine service. This practice has created conflict with taxis services and regulators elsewhere. In Saudi Arabia, they say, they get their cars and drivers from licensed companies and charge similar rates per ride.

"We're trying to be good citizens and stay within the rules and offer a better quality of service," Careem's founder, Mudassir Sheikha, said.

His company, which has its headquarters in the United Arab Emirates city of Dubai, was one of the first to enter the Saudi market in 2013. It now has nearly 100,000 users in the kingdom, a figure growing at about 40 percent per month, he said. The service is available in five cities, including the capital, Riyadh, and the commercial hub of Jidda.

"There are some (women) that take five to 10 trips with us every day," Sheikha said. "We don't see that kind of traffic anywhere."

## Women Need Not Apply

San Francisco-based Uber, which operates in more than 300 cities in 56 countries around the world, entered the Saudi market a year ago. In that time, the number of users has increased 20 times over, said Majed Abukhater, who serves as the company's regional general manager.

There is no actual law banning women from driving in Saudi Arabia. However, as a result of fatwas, or religious orders issued by Muslim clerics in the country, the government will not grant women driving licenses.

Families who can afford it will hire a chauffeur to take female members to work, to school, out shopping or to friends' houses, but even that option has limitations.

"I have a driver, but sometimes he is too busy bringing my sisters from school," said Gamar al-Douh, 24, who comes from a family of three girls with no brothers to help with the driving. "If I don't have someone to take me, I use Uber."

## From Point A To Point B

Radwan and her husband considered a chauffeur, but decided against it, because they just got married two years ago and are trying to save money to buy a house and raise a family.

Her husband could give her a lift to work, but that would take him out of his way.

Radwan used taxis while living abroad but avoids them in Saudi Arabia. Many cars are old and dirty, she said, and in most cases, the meters do not work, leaving passengers to haggle over the fare.

She and her friends used to be always exchanging phone numbers for good drivers, but she said they were not always available.

"If you can't find a driver, you have to wait for your husband. If not your husband, then your brother. And you know sometimes everyone is just so busy that going from point A to point B is really difficult," she said. "You can't even walk because (often) there's no sidewalk, so you're afraid of getting hit by a car."

Now, the conversation with her friends has changed. If one of them needs a driver, they tell her, "Why don't you take Uber or Careem?"
