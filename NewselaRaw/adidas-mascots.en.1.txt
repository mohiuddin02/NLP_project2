Adidas is offering to help high schools around the country drop their Native American mascots and create new ones.

The athletic shoe and apparel maker said Thursday it will provide free design resources to schools looking to give up their Native American mascots, nicknames, imagery or symbolism. It also pledged to provide financial help to ensure the cost of changing is not excessive.

Adidas announced the initiative in conjunction with the White House Tribal Nations Conference on Thursday in Washington, D.C. Adidas executives were among those attending the conference, which includes leaders from the 567 federally recognized tribes.

Adidas also said it will be a founding member of a coalition that addresses the problem of Native American mascots in sports. The German company has its North American headquarters in Portland, Oregon.

## 2,000 Schools Have Native American Mascots

According to the group Change the Mascot, there are about 2,000 schools nationwide that have Native American mascots.

The advocacy group says about a dozen schools have dropped Native American mascots over the past two years. An additional 20 are considering a change.

Eric Liedtke, Adidas head of global brands, said sports must be inclusive.

"Today's announcement is a great way for us to offer up our resources to schools that want to do what's right â€” to administrators, teachers, students and athletes who want to make a difference in their lives and in their world," said Liedtke, who attended the conference. "Our intention is to help break down any barriers to change."

He said that this change "can lead to a more respectful and inclusive environment for all American athletes."

## Design And Redesign For Every Sport

The program is voluntary and schools would work together with the company's design team to redesign logos and uniforms across all sports. Adidas said the program seeks to be a collaborative effort with schools.

The use of such mascots has drawn increased attention and controversy in recent years. The NFL's Washington Redskins have resisted appeals by Native American and civil rights groups to change the name and mascot.

In 2005, the NCAA warned schools that they would face sanctions if they did not change Native American logos or nicknames. Several colleges kept their nicknames by obtaining permission from tribes, such as the Florida State Seminoles and the University of Utah Utes.

## States Turn Spotlight On High Schools

Some states have taken action at the high school level. Last month California Governor Jerry Brown signed a law that prohibits schools from using the term "Redskins."

Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper recently ordered that a commission be created to study the use of Native American mascots in sports. It would also come up with a list of recommendations for possible legislation.

In 2012, the Oregon Board of Education ordered high schools to ban such mascots or risk losing public funding. The schools have until 2017 to comply.

## Native American Groups Commend Company

Change the Mascot's Jackie Pata is the executive director of the National Congress of American Indians. Both she and Ray Halbritter, leader of the Oneida Nation, applauded Adidas' move in a joint statement.

"We hope that a number of companies including FedEx, whose name adorns the Washington NFL team's stadium, will step forward and follow Adidas's lead," the statement said. "Adidas clearly understands that in 2015, businesses cannot sit on the sideline on this issue and that they must choose which side they are on. It is inspiring to see that Adidas has chosen to be on the side of inclusivity and mutual respect and has set an example for others to follow."
