KINGSTON, Jamaica â€” The deep oceans cover more than half the globe. The freezing water contains valuable treasures in the form of rocks and minerals. They have never been touched by humans.

However, this might all be about to change. Experts believe we are entering a period of deep seabed mining. Machines will be going under water to dig out some of the precious rocks and minerals.

Scientists will use robots to collect minerals from the sea floor. Copper, cobalt and gold are all valuable minerals. They are used to make smartphones and other high-tech products. The undersea materials are needed because there are no longer enough of them on land.

## Some People Say Oceans Should Be Protected

A group called the International Seabed Authority, or ISA, is in charge of the underwater world. It has been giving governments and companies permission to explore under the oceans. This has worried conservationists, or people who care about taking care of the environment. They believe the ocean's natural state must be protected. They also say not enough is known about the risks of pulling minerals from their natural settings.

Michael Lodge works at ISA. He says there has been a lot more undersea exploration in the last five years.

ISA is in charge of seabeds, or ocean floors, outside of the waters that surround a country. So far, it has given out 27 permits for undersea exploration, mostly since 2011. The permits are good for 15 years. They allow governments or companies to explore in the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans.

## Robots Would Dive Deep To Collect Minerals

Governments and companies have been moving quickly to join the exploration. Some experts believe deep-sea mining could start within the next five years. That means robots would be sent under water to collect the crushed minerals. The minerals would then be sent up through pipes and onto ships.

Last month, a group of scientists asked ISA to stop giving out new mining permits. The group said it wants to protect some underwater areas first.

Matthew Gianni works at the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition. He said that before any mining is allowed, experts need to really understand how it will affect the environment.

So far, most of ISA's permits have been given for a large area of the Pacific Ocean near Mexico and the United States. The area is known to be rich in copper, cobalt and manganese. As part of a plan to help the environment, miners are not allowed to touch some of the areas.

Scientists also want to explore the Western Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans. ISA thinks one of those areas could provide up to one-fourth of the world's cobalt, which is a metal.

## Scientist Warns Work Should Go Slowly

"The concentrations of minerals that you find in the seabed are very much richer than what's left on land," ISA's Lodge said. "So demand is only going to increase."

Douglas McCauley is a scientist at the University of California in Santa Barbara. He thinks the world is nearing a revolution in undersea exploration, and he is worried about its effect.

"(It looks) uncomfortably similar to what we did to land in the 1700s and 1800s," McCauley said. He added that when people began to mine and build on land, more and more types of animals died out.

Still, there are certain things people can do to approach seabed mining intelligently. First, he said, miners should learn what plants and animals are down there before we mine. Second, ISA should go slowly on mining permits and study the effects of mining as it is happening. Third, ISA should set up systems of protected areas before, not after, mining starts.

"You can't really blame people in the 1700s for the damage they did to the environment," McCauley said. "But we certainly are to blame if we don't do seabed mining properly."
