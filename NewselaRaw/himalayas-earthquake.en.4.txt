The Himalayas are a chain of mountains in Asia. Some of the tallest mountains in the world are in the Himalayas. Many people live among them. Earlier this year, two earthquakes hit the Himalayas. An earthquake is a scary event. The ground suddenly starts to shake. Sometimes earthquakes cause buildings to fall. People can be injured or killed.

Unfortunately, there may be more earthquakes in the Himalayas in the future. Scientists are worried about the harm more earthquakes would do. They fear that a large earthquake could cause dams in the Himalayas to break open.

## Hundreds Of Dams In Himalayas

A dam is a large wall that blocks the flow of a river. It holds the water back. There are hundreds of dams in the Himalayas.

If a dam breaks, all of the water it was holding back rushes out. In the Himalayas, the water would rush down through the mountains. It would rush into towns and cities. It could cause a lot of harm.

For example, one dam in the Himalayas is called the Tehri Dam. If it breaks, it would unleash a huge wave. The wave would be more than 500 feet high. The water would hit two towns on its way down the mountainside. Another six cities would be covered in water.

## India And China Keep Dams Secret

Dams in the Himalayas are supposed to be built to be very strong. Scientists are not sure that the dams are strong enough, though. Most of the dams in the Himalayas are owned by India and China. India and China have been secretive. They do not let many scientists study their dams.

Scientists cannot look closely at the dams. They do not know if the dams are strong enough. If a large earthquake hits, it could break some of them. A dam breaking could start a flood that would hurt people living near the mountains.
