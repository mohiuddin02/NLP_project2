When trained chefs prepared a tasty lunch, children ate more fruits and vegetables, a new study released on Monday said.

Getting them to drink plain milk instead of chocolate milk, however, was a much bigger challenge.

Researchers at Harvard University's School of Public Health studied the eating habits of more than 2,600 third- through eighth-graders in two low-income city school districts. The majority of the children were Hispanic, and their average age was 11 1/2. Trained chefs were randomly assigned to some schools to spice up fruits, vegetables and main courses with low-fat, low-salt recipes. In some of the schools, the project also experimented with how the foods were presented to the children in the food line.

## Fresh Broccoli Beat Out Piles Of Greens

The researchers weighed the quantities of food the kids took and their "plate waste," the food left over when they were finished eating. Monitors collected the food before children tossed it into the trash and checked what remained on their plates.

Not surprisingly, when kids were offered sauteed broccoli in garlic and olive oil or vegetable soup instead of piles of bland greens, they ate more of the better tasting healthy food, said Juliana Cohen. She is a researcher in Harvard's nutrition department. Also, the schools themselves saved money.

The study was released online Monday in JAMA Pediatrics, a magazine for doctors, scientists and other health professionals.

"What this study is showing is that this is an effective method to reduce plate waste," Cohen said. Children "are going to like the foods and they're going to eat the foods."

This is no small matter, because, as the study points out, 30 million children receive meals at school each day and many of them rely on those meals for as much as half of their calories.

## Food Presentation Matters

 According to the study, when kids eat junk food for lunch, it contributes to childhood obesity â€” being overweight to the point of health problems. Nearly one-third of children in the United States are overweight or obese.  Being obese can lead to diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol.

"When choosing what to eat, children are particularly influenced by the environment in which food is presented," the study said.

The Obama administration, in particular first lady Michelle Obama, has made healthy school lunches a priority. A separate study by Cohen and others rejected accounts that kids were avoiding healthier food because of its taste.

In the current study, researchers found that kids ate about the same amount of the main course. That did not bother the researchers, because the chefs were cooking healthier meals with low fat, low salt and whole-grain ingredients. After three months, the children didn't choose more fruits and vegetables prepared by chefs very often, but after seven months they did. They also chose more fruit in schools when it was displayed more attractively and placed where students could see it better. When both approaches were tried, the amount of fruits and vegetables the kids ate went up.

"We didn't see the increase in consumption immediately," Cohen said. "Schools shouldn't abandon healthy foods if students don't instantly" take to it, she said.

## A Chef Can Actually Save Money

The experiment's only failure occurred when the researchers pushed plain milk. To persuade children to choose it over chocolate milk, researchers put the plain milk where kids could more easily see it. That just didn't work. Cohen said schools might have to consider removing chocolate milk from cafeterias if they want children to drink more plain milk.

When asked how any school district could afford a chef, Cohen said the move actually saved money for the districts in the study. The chefs learn about tasty recipes and attractive food presentation in cooking school. Also, chefs from restaurants and caterers were able to cut down on waste with their knowledge of using food more efficiently and how much food to order for school meals. This trimmed costs for the districts.
