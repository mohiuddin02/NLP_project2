TIJUANA, Mexico — Emma Sanchez Paulsen's three sons like to climb into her bed. She tells them a bedtime story.

They used to all live in Vista, California. At night she told them stories about her childhood in Mexico. Sanchez Paulsen would tell her sons about running through green fields or strolling through city squares. Then, nine years ago, she was forced to leave the United States and return to Mexico. She had come to the U.S. against the law.

At the time, Alex was 5, Ryan was 3 and Brannon was just 2 months old. They stayed in America with their father. The only time they could cuddle on her bed was when they visited her in Tijuana. The Mexican city is near the Mexican-American border.

Her sons did not understand why a border separated their parents.

## Her Boys Made Up Stories

Then the boys became the ones making up stories.

They came up with different ways to bring their mother home. One idea was to bounce her over the border wall with a trampoline. Another was to attach a bunch of balloons to her arms and legs.

When Brannon was about 3, he asked her a question. He wanted to know if it would be OK to turn her into little pieces of paper.

"This way I can take you with me across the line," he said. "And then I can put you together with glue when we get back home."

## The Story Of An Elf

Sanchez Paulsen spent many nights alone without her sons. She wrote what she calls the most important bedtime story she will ever tell. It was about a young elf who battles dragons with his brothers. They visit their mother in the land of the fairies.

Sanchez Paulsen's story says: "But even though, for the little elf, his life seemed normal, he knew his family was not like others. His friends had a dad and a mom and he didn't. His brothers tried to help him with his confusion. They said, 'We think it's normal, but we know it's not a normal life," and they were right — it wasn't normal to grow up without a mother.'"

That tale, "The Little Elf," is now part of a collection of bedtime stories written by mothers and fathers living in Tijuana. The parents were all separated from their families. The book project is called "Cuentos Para Dormir." It means "Bedtime Stories" in Spanish.

## Helping Stories Become Books

For nearly a year, Sophia Sobko has crossed the border to Tijuana almost every week. She helps the parents turn their stories into books.

"I went to the library and could not find a single book explaining deportation to a child," she said. "This showed me that there is a need. So many kids are growing up so confused and so affected by this."

Sobko said the group has raised $2,000. It is enough money to make books for 10 parents.

## She Thinks Of What She's Missed

Sanchez Paulsen said she often thinks about the important times she has missed in her boys' lives. She was not there for their first days of school and their graduations.

They visit her about twice a month in Tijuana. Every time they sleep over, they gather on her bed for a bedtime story.

On the nights they are not there, she stares out her bedroom window. She looks at the lights on the border fence. She knows her husband and boys are on the other side.

Sanchez Paulsen's story ends with hope. The elf and his mother "would be together again in the happiest city in the world where they were once very happy."
