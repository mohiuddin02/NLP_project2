PRINCETON, N.J. – During my Practical Ethics class last month, several students stood up and walked out. They joined hundreds of others in a protest led by the Black Justice League (BJL). The BJL is one of many student groups that have emerged across the United States since the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in August 2014, and other police killings of unarmed African-Americans.

Later that day, members of the BJL occupied the office of Princeton University President Christopher Eisgruber, vowing not to leave until their demands were met. The first demand was to have "cultural competency training" for both academic and non-academic staff. A second was a requirement that students take classes on the history of marginalized people. Another demand was the provision of a space on campus dedicated specifically to African-American culture.

The demand that received national attention was for the university's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, and Wilson College, one of its residential colleges, to be renamed. The BJL wants to remove a large mural of Wilson, which hangs in the college dining hall. The League says that honoring Wilson is offensive to African-American students because Wilson was a racist.

## Wilson Championed Reforms

Wilson was a progressive in domestic affairs and an idealist in foreign policy. His forward-thinking administration passed laws against child labor and granted new rights to workers. He also reformed banking laws and challenged monopolies. In the years after World War I, he insisted that foreign policy be guided by moral values, and advocated for democracy in Europe.

However, his policies for African-Americans were reactionary and backward. In 1913, when he became U.S. president, he inherited a federal government that employed many African-Americans, some working alongside whites in mid-level management positions. Under his administration, racially segregated workplaces and washrooms, which had been abolished at the end of the Civil War, were re-introduced. African-American managers were demoted to lower positions. When a delegation of African-Americans protested, he told them that they should consider segregation a benefit.

## International Homage To His Achievements

Wilson's name features prominently at Princeton not only because he is one of the university's most famous graduates, and the only one to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. It is also because, before he was U.S. president, he was Princeton's president. In the words of Anne-Marie Slaughter, a former dean of the Woodrow Wilson School, he "perhaps did more than anyone else to transform (Princeton) from a preppie gentlemen's preserve into a great research university."

Wilson is famous worldwide for the "Fourteen Points" that he proposed as the basis of a peace treaty to end World War I. He called for autonomy for the peoples of the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires, as well as an independent Polish state. Today, there is a Wilson Square in Warsaw, Prague's main train station is named after him, and that there are Wilson streets in both Prague and Bratislava.

Among the other Fourteen Points is a call for open covenants, meaning no secret treaties plotting the post-war division of another country's territory. Another of the Points requested a reduction in trade barriers. Perhaps most important is the proposal for the formation of "a general association of nations" meant to "guarantee political independence and territorial integrity" among member countries.

That call led to the founding of the League of Nations, the predecessor of the United Nations. From 1920 until 1936, its headquarters was in the Palais Wilson, in Geneva. The building retains that name, and is today the headquarters of the U.N. Commissioner for Human Rights.

## Scrutinizing History

History is full of deeply flawed people who did great things. In the United States, we have only to look at slave-owning Founding Fathers and early presidents like George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison. One might plead on their behalf that, in contrast to Wilson, they were at least no worse than the standards that prevailed in their time. But is that sufficient grounds to continue commemorating them?

A New Orleans school board thought not. The school declared that no school should be named after a slaveholder and renamed George Washington Elementary School after an African-American surgeon who fought for desegregation of blood transfusions. Should the name of the nation's capital city be reconsidered, too?

When Wilson's name was added to Princeton's School of Public and International Affairs in 1948, Rosa Parks' famous bus ride was still seven years away, and segregation in the American South was not under serious challenge. Now it is unthinkable. Wilson's racism therefore becomes more noticeable, and he ceases to embody the values that are important to Princeton University today.

## A 21st Century Conversation

Wilson's contributions to the university, the United States, and the world cannot and should not be erased from history. They should, instead, be recognized in a manner that creates a nuanced conversation about changing values. Today's conversation should include both his positive achievements and his contributions to America's once-racist policies and practices.

At Princeton, one outcome of that conversation should be the education of students and faculty who would otherwise be unaware of the complexity of an important figure in the university's history. The end result of the conversation we should be having may well be the recognition that to attach Wilson's name to a college or school sends a message that misrepresents the values that an institution stands for.
