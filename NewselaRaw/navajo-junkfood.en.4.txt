Ann Neagle went shopping at the grocery store. It is one of the only places to buy fresh food near her home. She stopped in front of a bag of apples. Twelve apples cost $7.

The apples used to cost even more. Then Indian leaders removed a tax. Now the apples are less expensive.

Neagle, age 54, is part of the Navajo Nation. It is the largest tribe of Native Americans in the United States. The tribe is trying to make its members healthier.

## Healthy Food Costs More

The tribe's leaders want to make healthy food cheaper. They also want to make junk food expensive. They took the tax off healthy food. They will put a small tax on junk food. They hope the money will pay for things like vegetable gardens and exercise equipment.

Neagle is worried. Most of the stores near her do not carry healthy food. She says healthy food is expensive, even without the tax. She says she won't be able to afford food that costs more.

Instead of spending $7 on apples, Neagle could spend the same amount of money on boxed or frozen food. It would be cheaper, but it wouldn't be as healthy.

Neagle is not alone. Almost half of the Navajo Nation is considered poor. Many cannot buy food at regular grocery stores. They buy their food at gas stations and convenience stores.

## Is Soda Junk Food?

The tribe hasn't set a date for the tax to go into effect. Leaders still have to agree on the tax.

One problem might be deciding which foods are unhealthy. Chips and candy will be taxed as junk food. Some people think soft drinks should be taxed too. Soda companies argued against that.

Preston Yazzie is 20 years old. He says the tax is just going to make food more expensive. "I'll still buy chips or whatever," he says. "But maybe it will help some people."

Bashas' Grocery sits on tribal land. Most of the food it carries would be taxed.

There is canned meat in the front of the store. Behind it, there are soft drinks.

One person who works in the store said shoppers really like the hot Cheetos.

## Trying To Get Healthy

Most people in the Navajo Nation realize that health problems can be caused by unhealthy food.

Lawmaker Jonathan Nez knows about the power of healthy eating.  Four years ago, he weighed 300 pounds. He ate very unhealthy food.

Then he started eating healthy and lost weight. He also rides his bike and runs. He said those activities were impossible for him four years ago.

He probably wouldn't have liked the tax back then, Nez said with a laugh.

People who support the tax hope it will change the tribe for the better. Money from the tax will help pay for many new things on the reservation.

It might be spent on vegetable gardens. It could be used to buy exercise equipment.

It's going to take some time, Nez said. "But we'll get there."
