The Brontosaurus has come back from the dead. Well, in a way.

The largest animals to ever walk the Earth were long-necked, long-tailed dinosaurs known as the sauropods. The most famous of these giants is probably the Brontosaurus, a 35-ton, plant-eating dinosaur which lived 154 to 150 million years ago and whose name means "thunder lizard."

For more than a century scientists thought the Brontosaurus never existed, but a new study breathes life into the long-necked beast.

Call it the war of the paleontologists.

## The Name Game

The first Brontosaurus was named in 1879 by famous paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh. Its fossilized skeleton still stands on display in the Great Hall of the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History. However, in 1903, another paleontologist, Elmer Riggs, decided that Marsh's Brontosaurus was apparently the same as another dinosaur called the Apatosaurus. In cases like this, the rules of scientific naming state that the oldest name has priority, dooming Brontosaurus to a different type of extinction.

Now a new study suggests resurrecting the Brontosaurus name. It turns out that the original Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus fossils appear different enough to belong to separate groups after all.

"Generally, Brontosaurus can be distinguished from Apatosaurus most easily by its neck, which is higher and less wide," said study author Emanuel Tschopp, a vertebrate paleontologist at the New University of Lisbon in Portugal. "So, although both are very massive and robust animals, Apatosaurus is even more extreme than Brontosaurus."

Taking five years of research and many visits to museums in Europe and the United States, the study analyzed 477 different physical features of 81 sauropod fossils. The researchers' initial goal was to clarify the family tree of the species making up the family of sauropods known as the diplodocids. It includes the dinosaurs Diplodocus, Apatosaurus and now Brontosaurus.

In a nearly 300-page report, the scientists concluded that three known species of Brontosaurus exist. Brontosaurus excelsus was the first discovered, and the other two are Brontosaurus parvus and Brontosaurus yahnahpin. Tschopp and his colleagues published their findings online April 7 in the scientific journal PeerJ.

## Name Means "Thunder Lizard"

"We're delighted that Brontosaurus is back," said Jacques Gauthier, curator of vertebrate paleontology and zoology at the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History.

"I grew up knowing about Brontosaurus — what a great name, 'thunder lizard' — and never did like that it sank into Apatosaurus," said Gauthier, who did not participate in the study.

Vertebrate paleontologist Mike Taylor at the University of Bristol in England said the study was extremely complete and comprehensive. He spoke of "the beautifully detailed and informative illustrations, and the degree of care taken to make all their work reproducible and verifiable."

Taylor, who also did not participate in the study, said it "really sets a new standard. I am in awe of the authors."

Mathew Wedel, a vertebrate paleontologist at Western University of Health Sciences in Pomona, California, agreed. "The incredible amount of work here is what other research is going to be building on for decades," he said.

Tschopp noted that they could not have done such detailed research 15 or more years ago. It was only with the recent discoveries of so many dinosaurs similar to Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus that it became possible to reexamine how different they actually were, he said

## Will Other Sauropods Be Renamed?

Kenneth Carpenter, director and curator of paleontology at Utah State University Eastern's Prehistoric Museum, also found the study impressive. But he said the Apatosaurus fossil has never been described in detail, and suggested that researchers should have done this if they wanted to compare it to Brontosaurus. "So is Brontosaurus valid after all?" Carpener asked. "Maybe. But I think the verdict is still out."

All in all, these findings emphasize "that sauropods were much more diverse and fascinating than we've realized," Taylor says. Indeed, the recognition that the Brontosaurus and the Apatosaurus are two different dinosaurs is "only the tip of the iceberg," Taylor added.

He expected that many other sauropods will be renamed as researchers take a closer look at their similarities and differences.

"The big mounted apatosaur at the American Museum of Natural History is probably something different again, yet to be named," Taylor said. "Yet another nice complete apatosaur, which is in a museum in Tokyo, is probably yet another new and distinct dinosaur."

This diversity of sauropods emphasizes "that the Late Jurassic of North America in which they lived may have been a weird time," Wedel said. "You basically had an explosion of these things in what could be harsh environments, which raises the question of how they could have found enough food to have supported them all."

In other words, research that helped resurrect Brontosaurus may have birthed new mysteries as well.
