SEATTLE â€” When Lynne Rodgers Miller saw the news of the mudslide in Washington state on Saturday, she knew right away where the land had given way. Her husband, Daniel J. Miller, knew, too.

In 1999, the Millers wrote a report filed with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, warning of "the potential for a large catastrophic failure" on the hill.

"We've known it would happen at some point," said Daniel Miller, a geomorphologist who studies how landscapes are formed and change. "We just didn't know when."

On Saturday, at least 24 people died when a square-mile area an hour north of Seattle was buried in up to 40 feet of mud. Officials say many more are still missing.

## "Known That It's Been Failing"

Daniel Miller knows the hill's history, having collected reports on it since the 1950s. He has a half-dozen folders stuffed with maps, slides, models and drawings. They all tell the story of an unstable hillside that has defied efforts to prop it up.

That's why he could not believe what he saw in 2006 when he returned to the hill within weeks of a mudslide that threatened homes on Steelhead Drive. Instead of seeing homes being abandoned, he saw carpenters building new ones.

"Frankly, I was shocked that the county permitted any building across from the river," he said.

"We've known that it's been failing," he said of the hill.

Daniel Miller believes officials should have understood the danger. But John Pennington, head of Snohomish County's Department of Emergency Management, said the area was not in danger. "It was considered very safe," Pennington said in a news conference Monday. "This was a completely unforeseen slide. This came out of nowhere."

Snohomish County Executive John Lovick and Public Works Director Steve Thomsen said Monday night they were not aware of the 1999 report. A slide of this size "is very difficult to predict," Thomsen said. "There was no indication, no indication at all."

Despite a slide in 2006, at least five homes were built that year on Steelhead Drive, according to Snohomish County records. Another home was built in the neighborhood in 2009.

"They didn't even stop pounding nails," said Tracy Drury, an environmental engineer who studied the area with Miller soon after the 2006 slide. "We were surprised."

## A River's Water, And Gravity

Irvin Wood and his wife, Judith, of Bothell, owned the last home allowed in the slide zone.

The Woods used the property as a weekend getaway. But they were not there on Saturday when the mudslide wiped out their mobile home and swept away neighbors who are now missing and presumed dead.

Wood said nobody was warned about the chance of a massive mudslide, but he believes it is not realistic to think the government could have prevented the disaster.

"If the hillsides were going to (slide) away, they were going to (slide) away," Wood said. "That's kind of what happens around here."

There have been at least five slides on the site.

According to a 1949 report, a main cause of the slides is the river slowly washing away the "toe" left behind by a previous slide. The "toe" supports the millions of tons of dirt behind it, like someone with their back against a bulging door. Eventually, the toe would fail from the water eating away at it, and gravity would pull the hillside down.

In 1969, a geologist with the state Department of Natural Resources noted that a 150-foot section of the wall had caved. It resulted in a dangerous, several-hundred-foot mudflow of the same sort that rescuers are facing today.

Saturday's monster slide was much larger, leaving a scarp of nearly 600 feet. It was about nine times taller than the 1949 slide and four times taller than a slide in 1967.

"We always thought there was a possibility that a catastrophic event could come," said Pat Stevenson, the environmental manager of the Stillaguamish Tribe. "We were hoping that wouldn't happen."

## "Heartbroken For Their Neighbors"

Over the years, there were discussions about whether to buy out the property owners in the area, but nothing came of them.

"I think we did the best that we could" given that "nobody wanted to sell their property and move," Drury said.

Stevenson said county officials seemed more focused on whether the homes were in flood areas than the risk of a landslide.

In 2003, Ron and Gail Thompson moved into a one-bedroom cabin on five acres on Steelhead Drive, said their daughter, Jennifer Johnson.

"I had conversations with the Army Corps of Engineers the last time this happened. They showed me a map and said mom and dad's house would be safe," she said Monday. "When we moved them in there, I never in a million years, never in a billion years, thought about (a mudslide) ... Dad was like, 'We're going to be fine,' and I just believed him."

Johnson's parents and 85-year-old grandmother left their house eight minutes before the slide hit on Saturday morning for a trip to Costco, Johnson said. The couple lost everything.

"They are in mourning. They're in shock," she said. "They're heartbroken for their neighbors."
