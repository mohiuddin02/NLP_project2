OTTAWA, Canada â€“ Today, 1 in every 9 people on the planet are hungry. They are hungry because food waste is a big problem. One-fourth of all the food in the world is wasted each year. If that waste is cut in half, the world could feed an extra billion people. It is time to end hunger.

Some people think food waste happens just in the kitchen. In rich countries, people do throw out a great deal of food from the kitchen. In poor countries, though, people waste very little. Most of the waste happens much earlier. For example, it happens at the farm. Birds and rats may eat the food. Sometimes the food goes bad before it gets to the market.

## Better Roads, More Food Research

There are some ways to solve the food waste. These fixes are used mainly in rich countries. There has not been enough help for the poor countries.

I work at a research center. Our work shows some ways to end hunger in poor countries. Most of these countries are in Africa and Asia.

One way is to have better roads in poor countries. Roads help farmers bring their extra vegetables and fruits to the market. If there are no roads, the food cannot get to buyers. Then the food will go to waste. Roads also allow farmers to bring soil to their fields. They can get other supplies for their farms, too. With these supplies, the farmers can grow even more food.

A second way to end hunger is to do more studies. Today, about $5 billion is spent each year on food research. It is not enough money. Research can help fight disease in crops. It can help find ways of growing more food for less money. We should do research now. It can help save much more money later.

Hunger is a very hard problem. We should still try to end hunger though. As I have written, one way to end hunger is by building better roads. The second way is to put more money into food research.
