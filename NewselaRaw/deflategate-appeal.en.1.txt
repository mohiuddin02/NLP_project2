New England Patriots star quarterback Tom Brady and the players' union are headed to a legal clash with the National Football League (NFL) over "Deflategate." Football Commissioner Roger Goodell rejected Brady's appeal last Tuesday and upheld his four-game suspension.

In May, the league said it found the Superbowl MVP was "likely generally aware" that equipment assistants had conspired to deflate the Patriots' footballs for last season's American Football Conference (AFC) championship game against the Indianapolis Colts. Letting the air out of the balls made them easier to throw and catch.

The Patriots won that game, 45-7, and two weeks later defeated the Seattle Seahawks in the Super Bowl.

## NFL Says Brady Destroyed His Cellphone

Recent discussions between the league and the NFL Players Association (NFLPA) failed to produce a compromise. Several people connected to the discussions said the union now plans to move swiftly to attempt to have Brady's suspension overturned in court.

Brady gave the union his approval later Tuesday for a lawsuit to be filed on his behalf, according to a person familiar with the situation.

Goodell revealed a new piece of information Tuesday. He said the league had learned that Brady had his cellphone destroyed shortly before meeting with the NFL's investigators in March.

In his ruling, Goodell wrote that the evidence fully supported his findings that Brady was involved in Deflategate.

"Mr. Brady participated in a scheme to tamper with the game balls after they had been approved by the game officials for use in the AFC Championship Game," Goodell said. Secondly, "Mr. Brady willfully obstructed the investigation by, among other things, affirmatively arranging for destruction of his cellphone knowing that it contained potentially relevant information that had been requested by the investigators."

Goodell stated he has enormous respect for Brady's accomplishments on the field and his role in the community. Nevertheless, Goodell concluded that Brady's actions harmed "the integrity of, and public confidence in, the game of professional football."

## "Process Was A Sham," Agent Says

Brady's agent, Don Yee, criticized Goodell's ruling and the NFL appeal process in a strongly worded written statement. Yee said Goodell's decision "is deeply disappointing, but not surprising because the appeal process was thoroughly lacking in procedural fairness. ... The appeal process was a sham, resulting in the Commissioner rubber-stamping his own decision."

Yee said that Brady and his representatives gave Goodell a tremendous amount of electronic information, which was ignored.

"The Commissioner's decision and discipline has no precedent in all of NFL history. His decision alters the competitive balance of the upcoming season. The decision is wrong and has no basis, and it diminishes the integrity of the game," Yee said

People familiar with the case expect the union's lawsuit on Brady's behalf to be filed either in Massachusetts or in Minnesota. The NFLPA could seek a court order that would let Brady play while the case goes through the court system.

## String Of Legal Clashes

The NFL made the first legal move Tuesday, filing a case in New York to attempt to have the suspension upheld.

This will be the latest in a string of legal clashes between the league and union over disciplinary measures imposed by the NFL on its players.

The league had indefinitely suspended former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice for beating his girlfriend. However, that was overturned by Barbara Jones, a former judge appointed by Goodell to hear Rice's appeal.

But that was a disciplinary measures taken under the personal conduct policy, and the union argued that the policy was not in place when Ray's conduct occurred. The NFL changed its disciplinary guidelines for domestic violence cases in summer 2014.

The union won't have that legal argument available for Brady. But those connected to the case on the players side of the sport say they believe Brady and the union have a strong case and an excellent chance of winning.

The NFLPA can argue that a general awareness of a deflated football scheme is not enough proof to suspend a player. The union also can argue that the sport's guidelines for handling footballs apply to teams, not to players, and that Brady was given an arbitrary punishment that no player has been given before. The union can also attack the league's approach to explaining the science related to the possible effect of the weather on the footballs. Brady claimed that cold weather caused them to deflate.

## Settlement Proved Elusive

The league and union explored the possibility of a settlement of Brady's appeal that would have kept the two sides out of court, according to people familiar with the case. But it did not appear that much progress was made. The union did not appear willing to agree to a suspension of any length for Brady, and the league maintained that a significant suspension was necessary.

There was strong support by many within the league for Goodell to keep the full four-game suspension.

"I think he has to stay with the same thing," a high-ranking official with one NFL team said last week.

The Patriots reported to their training camp Wednesday. Quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo would be in line to open the regular season as the team's starter if Brady's suspension is upheld and he cannot play. Garoppolo was a second-round draft choice by the Patriots last year and had success in limited playing time as a rookie. He completed 19 of 27 passes for 182 yards with one touchdown and no interceptions last season.
