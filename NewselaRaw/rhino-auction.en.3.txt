HOUSTON, Texas â€” A Texas club hopes to raise more than $1 million to save the endangered black rhino.

How? It plans to sell a permit to kill a rhino in the African country of Namibia.

Some animal preservation groups are bashing the idea.

"More than ridiculous," said Wayne Pacelle. He is the president of the Humane Society of the United States. "It's absurd. You're going to help an endangered animal by killing an endangered member of that population?"

## Rhino Hunted For Its Horn

Animal activists worldwide are joining together to protect the elephant and rhino from people with high-powered weapons, he said. The auction "sends exactly the wrong signal," he said.

In October, the Dallas Safari Club said it would sell the rhino hunting permit to the highest bidder. The permit is one of only five offered each year by the Namibian government. It will be first sold outside Namibia. A permit is required to legally kill a rhino. The money raised from the auction will pay for programs to protect the [endangered animal](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species).

"This is advanced, state-of-the-art wildlife conservation and management," said John J. Jackson III. He is a member of the safari club and a Louisiana-based wildlife lawyer. "It's not something the (regular person) understands, but they should," Jackson said. On a safari, a person hunts or just watches animals in the wild.

He called the auction the best way to preserve the rhino. "The conservation hunt is a hero in the hunting community."

Only about 4,000 black rhinos remain in the wild. This is down from 70,000 rhinos in the 1960s. Nearly 1,800 of the rhinos are in Namibia located in southwestern Africa, said the safari club.

Hunters target rhinos, mainly for their horns. It is not legal to own a rhino horn, because the only way to get the horn is to kill the animal. But it is highly valuable. The horn is made of keratin, the same stuff that makes up fingernails and hooves. The horn is carved into sculptures and used as medicine, mainly in Asia.

## "Hanging In The Balance"

The safari club auction is scheduled for January.

According to Jackson, a committee will select the rhino to be hunted, which will be approved by the Namibian government. The rhino will be on older male, too old to father calves. It will likely be a troublemaker that is killing other rhinos, he said.

Jackson said the rhino hunt will actually be a good thing. Killing an older, bad-tempered rhino means that more rhino calves will be born, he said.

All of the auction money will be put in a bank, Jackson said. It will be held there until the hunting permit is approved. Then the government of Namibia will receive the money, which will be spent only on protecting rhinos and their territory, he said. The destruction of their home is another reason there are so few rhinos left.

Ben Carter said money will mean a lot in the fight to protect the rhino. Carter is the president of the Safari Club.

Jeffrey Flocken strongly disagrees. Flocken is a director of the International Fund for Animal Welfare.

Flocken says the club is trying to get people excited about killing one of the last rhinos on earth. He called the auction "totally irresponsible." Killing rhinos is out of control, and the club is trying to take advantage of "a horrific situation," he said.

The rhinos' "future existence is already hanging in the balance," Flocken said.

## Getting A Trophy Permit

Rick Barongi, director of the Houston Zoo, said the hunt was legal. But it "sends a mixed message." Barongi also is vice president of the International Rhino Foundation.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said it will decide whether the winning hunter can bring the dead rhino into the country as a trophy. Under law, the government department must grant permission.

To get the permit to bring back the rhino, it must be killed as part of a well-managed program that protects the species.

The department granted a permit for a black rhino earlier this year. The rhino was killed in Namibia in 2009.

Pacelle said the Humane Society would work to oppose the permit.

The Namibian government did not respond to an email by The Associated Press.

The auction may be the best plan if the money raised saves hundreds of rhinos, Barongi said.

"Because the alternative is you can lose them all," he said.
