LOS ANGELES —Tony Castillo noticed something new. He was skateboarding down Fairfax Avenue one December morning, like he had for more than two years.

A bright red sign with white words stared him in the face. It was on the streetlight pole in front of a sneaker store. It looked like a normal street sign. But there was nothing on the sign about parking, driving or walking. Instead, it had the words to a rap song on it. The words were talking about the same spot Castillo had just ridden past.

Hours later, Castillo found himself sweeping in front of his store. He was still pulled toward the sign. He set his fingers to work pulling off the sign. After about 15 minutes, Castillo held one of his most treasured pieces of street art.

"I can see the energy the artist put into it," he said. "This is some really thoughtful stuff."

## Return To LA

Artist Jason Shelowitz installed 45 of the signs in December. He had designed them for Los Angeles County. Shelowitz is also known as Jay Shells. He believes that since December, all of the signs have disappeared.

A newspaper reporter searched for 19 of the signs and found only bits of one. A spokesman for the city of Los Angeles said it is against the law to post signs on public property without permission. But the city has no record of removing any of the signs.

Some signs have been taken by lovers of street art like Castillo. At least one quoted rapper took his sign for himself. Rappers including Murs, Action Bronson and Lupe Fiasco have said they like the project. They have been posting pictures of their signs on Instagram, Facebook or Twitter.

Shelowitz said he is coming back to Los Angeles later this month. He plans to put up six new signs around town.

"I was thinking (the signs) would be a hidden gift for people who pay attention to their surroundings," Shelowitz said. "I wanted it to be something where if you happened to see it, you'd be like, 'That's ... awesome!' — and just take a minute."

## "To Mark That Corner"

Growing up in the suburbs of New York, Shelowitz was surrounded by music. He and his friends drove into the city to see live hip-hop. As they got older, some became DJs and producers.

Years later, he was at home on the Upper East Side. Big L's track "Lifestylez Ov Da Poor &amp; Dangerous" started playing one day. The song warns against late-night trips to a park at the corner of West 139th Street and Lenox Avenue in New York. Shelowitz thought about the song, and the project was born.

"I think I just realized at that moment — I had never been there," he said. And when he arrived, "I just thought it would be so cool to mark that corner with the lyric."

He started asking people on the Internet for help. He wanted to know of any words of rap songs with places in them. The suggestions rolled in. Soon, he put up more than 50 signs in New York. Months later, he brought 46 signs to Los Angeles during a holiday visit, and put up 45 of them.

Shelowitz took to Twitter in late December. He sent out pictures of where the signs were, weeks after he put them up.

But by then, the treasure hunt had already begun, and most of the signs were gone.

## Saw His Own Words

Anwar Carrots, 23, took it upon himself to steal his own sign.

Carrots showed up at a friend's party several weeks ago. He was immediately greeted by chatter about his sign.

What sign, he wondered, so a friend took him a few steps outside. There he saw words he had rapped at age 17 "just for fun" with his friend.

"I kind of freaked out," said Carrots. "I was like, 'This is legendary.'"
