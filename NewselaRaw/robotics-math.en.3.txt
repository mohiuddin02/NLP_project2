HUNTERSVILLE, N.C. â€” A group of third-graders practiced teamwork.

The students had to work together to built a pyramid out of cups. They could not touch the cups with their hands. Instead, they used a rubber band attached to strings. It took them just 10 minutes to finish.

This spring, they will take part in a robotics contest. To win, they must work together to invent and build a project.

The third-graders attend Huntersville Elementary School in North Carolina. The school is letting its best students out of their regular math classes to work on special projects. These projects will teach the students to think creatively and solve problems.

## More Fun Than Math!

Instead of math, the third-graders are building and programming robots. They are using Lego Mindstorms robots to learn how.

Sabrina Walters is the teacher in charge of the robotics program. She wants students to learn how to make their own robots and video games, not just buy them.

They must invent something that people would like to buy. They are allowed to improve something that already exists. Or, they can make something completely new.

The class has come up with many ideas. Some of the ideas help people learn. Others are just fun. The ideas include a skateboard that teaches people how to learn, and a remote-controlled car. The contest will be held May 30.

Last year, six teams from different schools took part in the contest. At the time, Walters was teaching at another school. Her team made an electric guitar. They came in second place. The winning team created a machine that can feed a dog.

## Building As A Team

Colin Edelman is one of the third-graders. He wants to build a robot model of the Statue of Liberty. It is a huge statue on an island near New York City. It is more than 300 feet tall. Although much shorter, Colin's robot would be able to answer questions about New York. It would also be able to say how the Statue of Liberty came to America from France.

"It'd be sort of like Siri," he said. Siri is the computer voice on an iPhone.

Colin said the classes have taught him about teamwork. He has also learned how to solve problems. He gives the class a nine out of 10 rating because it is interesting and challenging.

Colin said his team had one big weakness. "We don't really work together that well yet," he said. His team will learn to work together better and become strong at teamwork, because "that's how we'll end up winning," Colin said.
