KANSAS CITY — A few years ago, a boy passed out during football practice.

"He hadn't eaten in three days," said Sergeant Brad Deichler. He is with the Police Athletic League of Kansas City (PAL). It is a sports program for kids. "He wasn't telling anyone because he didn't want his friends to know."

Officers have known for years that some of the kids live in homes without heat or electricity. Others have parents out of work. There are kids who stay on a friend's sofa, because their parents cannot pay the rent.

## At Least One Good Meal A Day

After that day on the football field, police knew they had to do more to help. The officers already knew some kids did not have enough food. Sometimes they gave them food. Yet they did not realize that some kids were starving.

Now, the kids in the sports league get a meal after school five days a week. It includes fruit and yogurt, or a sandwich and chips. They always get milk.

"Sometimes this is their only dinner," said Officer Antoney Perez. He arranged for a food bank to bring the food. This way, the kids in the program get at least one good meal a day.

Some kids show up at games to help sell food. They come because they get to eat the food too.

"Sometimes I'll have 20 kids show up to help," Deichler said. "They're eating chili dogs at 8 in the morning — they're starving."

## Pay The Rent Or Buy Food?

Other programs have seen the need for food shoot up.

The food bank that feeds the kids is called Harvesters. In 2010, it fed 4,000 children. This year, it fed 7,300 children.

At the police sports league, some kids come and just sit in the stands. They are more interested in the food than playing sports.

"I love the chips," said Mark Johnson, who is 10 years old. He also said he loves drinking the milk, because it has not gone bad.

In 2010, 1 out of every 4 kids in Kansas City did not have enough to eat at home.

Nicholson-Watson is in charge of the food bank. She said some families have to choose whether to pay their rent, their heating bills or buy food. They cannot afford all three. "It's particularly hard on the children," she said.

Too often, kids are too embarrassed to say they are hungry.

## "A Lot Of Hungry Kids"

Last year, an officer visited the home of four sports league kids. Their home had no heat or power.

The kids were trying to cook potatoes on a grill outside in the cold.

"That was dinner," Deichler said. Their parents were "fighting in any way they could to put anything on the table for the kids."

Within two hours, PAL brought food for the family. PAL also paid the heating and power bills. The sports league bought the family a new stove and a new furnace to heat the house.

Police still help the boy who passed out on the football field. They gave his family a Thanksgiving dinner, and officers make sure he is doing well.

"There are a lot of hungry kids in this town," Deichler said.

"If nothing else goes right in the day, we make sure the food goes right," Deichler said. "That's the most important thing we do."
