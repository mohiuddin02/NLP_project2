DALLAS — The place where a kid can be a kid also wants to be the place where mom can get a cappuccino and dad can chow down on fancy pizza.

The Chuck E. Cheese's chain, which is based in Irvine, Texas, this week completed the nationwide rollout of the biggest change to its menu in more than a decade. The change is meant in part to make the restaurant more appealing to adults.

New menu items include California Alfredo thin and crispy pizza with mushrooms and spinach and, for a limited time, New York-style cheesecake.

Tom Leverton is head of the company that owns Chuck E. Cheese's. He said that while children may be the ones who want to visit the restaurant, it's the parents who hold the car keys.

"When you think about Chuck E. Cheese's, you certainly do think about kids entertainment upfront as well as pizza," Leverton said. But, he added, "If we provide a good experience for mom and dad, they are going to be more willing to take their kid to Chuck E. Cheese's instead of … going out to a competing place."

## Coffee And Dessert Bars

Nationwide, the company rolled out the Cali Alfredo pizza along with a change to its BBQ chicken pizza, now with a smoky barbecue sauce and fried onions. It also has introduced whole-wheat tortilla wraps such as chicken Caesar.

And it added churros with dipping sauces.

All locations in North Texas are being remodeled in the coming months. Some will include full coffee bars, featuring cappuccinos and lattes. Others will have full dessert bars.

If those items prove popular here, they may be expanded.

The company's website touts "all-new menu items for grown-up tastes," proclaiming "we're not playing games with our food anymore."

In addition to the menu changes, the company is considering replacing those jingling game tokens with a plastic "play pass" like the one at Dave &amp; Buster's. It also sees an opportunity to get more into the to-go business, with the food drawing diners who don't necessarily have kids.

Parental feedback on the menu additions so far has been great, Leverton said.

The chain's push toward the upscale customer comes as the pizza industry nationwide is beefing up its menu in the face of increased competition.

In November, Pizza Hut, the nation's largest pizza chain, announced it was adding menu items that were offered at more upscale pizza places.

## Pepperoni Pizza Still Tops

Still, at a Chuck E. Cheese's in suburban Dallas this week, several parents said they like the chain's pizza as it is, especially the pepperoni, which seemed to be the most popular this particular evening. None of the parents spotted during the dinner hour were dining on the new menu items.

As she kept an eye on her daughters Annabelle, 5, and Gracie, 8, Brandie Bohmer noted that bolder flavors might come in handy during birthday parties, when the restaurant hosts adults as well as kids.

Bohmer is a mom of four and said she has at least two birthday parties at Chuck E. Cheese's every year.

"When I have all of my family come, you do like to have different pizzas," she said, as Gracie and Annabelle stopped by to display their ticket haul.

She and the kids are partial to pepperoni, which Bohmer said she'd buy on its own merits. She doesn't think she'd order any of the new pizzas on a regular "family fun day" outing.

Nearby, Zab Herrera, 38, also handed out slices of pepperoni pizza to his daughters. It's easier, he said, to just get one pizza that the whole family likes.

Currently, the to-go operation at Chuck E. Cheese's consists mostly of parents taking home uneaten pizza slices. Leverton wants more diners to make a special trip just for the pizza. The company is investing more in equipment and hiring talented employees to improve the food.

## Adding Wi-Fi

Leverton said a new company building will have an expanded test kitchen, which is used to develop new kinds of food, and an executive chef who graduated from the highly respected Culinary Institute of America.

"We are a real restaurant, and having that test kitchen will ensure that this is not just a one-time big bang," he said.

Beyond the food, the company is adding Wi-Fi to its U.S. locations.

In some local outlets, the company will test the new "play pass" system, replacing tokens.

That's a scary thought for Bohmer.

"Because this is for younger kids, I say no," Bohmer said. "If they lose one token, I'm not going to cry over that. If they lose a card with 100 tokens, I'm going to cry."

Not to worry, the company said. The cards can be reissued.

Leverton didn't give many details on the test. Mostly, the company is excited to talk about the food.

"We want to make sure the adults are as excited about the visit as the children. The menu was a great opportunity to really do that."
