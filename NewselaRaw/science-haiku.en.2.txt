SEATTLE — The language of the United Nation's most recent international report on climate change is not exactly what you'd call poetic. The report is crammed with technical details about greenhouse gas emissions, rising sea levels and atmospheric circulation. And it's not only dense, it's also extremely long: some 2,200 pages.

Seattle oceanographer Gregory Johnson helped write the chapter on marine measurements. But even he was having a hard time wrapping his head around the massive compilation. So when a bad cold kept him in the house one weekend, Johnson decided to distill the report down to its essential meaning. He did this via a centuries-old Japanese art form: haiku. Then, he added his own watercolors.

With a bit of encouragement, Johnson decided to post his finished booklet on the Web. It is now getting a lot of attention.

"I was surprised that as many people responded as positively as they did," said Johnson. "It's been tweeted a thousand times, or something."

## Saying Much With Little

Online commenters have penned companion verses and several teachers plan to use the booklet in their classrooms. Fans are clamoring to translate Johnson's work into a range of languages: Hindi, Italian, German, French and Luxembourgish. Mother Jones blogger Chris Mooney praised Johnson for summing up [climate change](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming) in an "understandable, and even moving, way."

Johnson took as his template the report's "Summary for Policymakers." For each of its 19 main points, he crafted a haiku. Where the summary devotes two pages and four graphs to global warming's effects on ice and snow — a topic that takes up more than 100 pages in the full report — Johnson boils it down to 17 syllables.

_Glaciers and ice sheets  
melt worldwide, speed increasing  
Sea ice, snow retreat_

Johnson also illustrates the poems with simple watercolors, ranging from a sunlit iceberg to smokestacks and a swing set on a grassy slope. The latter is paired with the verse:

_Forty years from now  
children will live in a world  
shaped by our choices_

Haiku, with its familiar 5-7-5 rhythm, might seem like an odd way for a scientist to express himself. Johnson, though, was already well acquainted with it. For the past few years, he's been composing Facebook posts in haiku as a way to keep his messages brief and positive.

## "Away From Technical Language"

Like most scientists, Johnson's professional life is all about complexity, which is part of what made the haiku exercise appealing.

"It does make you focus and distill things," he said. "Another nice thing about haiku is that it generally took me away from technical language."

He never intended anyone except family and friends to see the finished product. But they were so enchanted they urged him to make it more widely available.

Johnson was wary.

"It took me a little while to get up the courage to put this out there," he said. "It's a highly personal interpretation."

Eventually, he agreed to allow the Seattle environmental group Sightline to post the booklet on its website. Within two weeks of publication last month, the post received nearly 40,000 hits. It was reposted by Salon, Huffington Post and Yes! Magazine.

"I think there's a hunger for a simple and clear" presentation of global warming, said Sightline's Anna Fahey. It's a subject, she said, that is usually filled with complicated technical language and lots of numbers.

## Crafting An Emotional Beauty

And combined with Johnson's paintings, the simple verses are also moving in a way that scientific reports are not, Fahey added.

"What's striking is how Greg got the facts in there, but also made this beautifully elegant and emotional case for why it matters," she said.

There have been calls for a line of T-shirts or publishing a version of the booklet. But both Johnson and Sightline say they have no intention of profiting from the pamphlet.

Fahey said that they're excited to offer it as a free educational tool. But because it's being shared widely online "we don't have complete control over what people do with it," she said.

The Sightline post has already attracted comments from people who don't believe in global warming. Johnson, though, prefers not to engage in what he considers mainly a political debate. In any case, his own mind is made up. His work on ocean monitoring has convinced him that some changes caused by global warming are detectable now, and more are certain in the future.

Haiku and watercolors won't change that — nor are they likely to change the minds of those who don't believe the phenomenon is real. But if his booklet inspires some people to read at least part of the U.N. report, Johnson says he'll be happy.

"This is a very modest little piece of work. To be honest, I don't have any big" goals for it, he said.
