WASHINGTON â€” A group of extremist fighters has found a scary new way to talk in secret.

They are using message apps on smartphones. Some of the apps put text messages into a secret code. The code makes sure that no else can read the messages. Other apps just destroy the messages.

Often it means the American government cannot read them either.

Michael B. Steinbach is the one of the government's top officials for fighting terrorism. He said the government has no idea what these messages say. That is a big problem, because these groups may be planning attacks.

On Wednesday, Steinbach asked lawmakers to allow the government to read the messages. Social media companies have not been helping.

Phone and app companies say they cannot unlock the codes. They also say they do not keep a record of the messages.

## Companies Want Messages To Stay Private

Tim Cook is in charge of Apple. Last week he argued that the company made the right choice to make FaceTime and iMessage completely private. The two apps help people to talk on the iPhone.

Cook said that many people have good reasons to send messages no one else can read. Letting the government see them is against freedom of speech, he said.

Hundreds of millions of people around the world use these apps.

Fighters from the Islamic State group use them also.

Islamic State is a violent group. It wants to start its own country under Islamic law. Its fighters have taken over parts of Syria and Iraq. Both countries are in the Middle East.

About 200,000 people worldwide see messages each day from the Islamic State group.

The group tries to get new members by posting messages online. Its leaders look at sites like Twitter and Facebook. They want to see who is sharing their messages. They then invite the people to text them directly.

In the last few months, Islamic State has used these apps more and more.

Until now, the government has stayed quiet about it. Officials do not want the fighters to know they cannot read the messages.

## Lawmaker Wants Judges To Decide

Michael McCaul is a lawmaker from Texas. On Wednesday, he told other lawmakers that extremists use the apps to avoid getting caught.

He said the fighters' tricks are new. The United States must change its way of thinking if it wants to stop these groups.

Steinbach is the top government anti-terrorism official. He said judges should decide who can see the messages. If a judge agrees, the social media companies should give them to the government.

The Islamic State group is using these apps more and more.

Since last summer, the government has arrested nearly 40 people. The government thinks they were trying to join groups like Islamic State or help them.

Most of them were on social media, John Carlin said. He is a national security official.

Not long ago, the U.S. Air Force destroyed an Islamic State command center. Experts found it after a fighter talked about it online.

Last fall, Islamic State leaders created a new rule. Fighters need permission to take pictures of attacks. Fighters also need permission to take pictures of places.
