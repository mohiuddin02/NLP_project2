NEW YORK — Apple Stores are turning into something more than just a place to buy the latest phone or computer. They are becoming art galleries. Around the country, Apple Stores will now feature the works of photographers and other artists who use iPads, iPhones and Mac computers to create art.

Apple asked 12 artists to create works on Apple devices. The artwork is now displayed both on Apple's website and in all its stores.

One of those 12 artists is Austin Mann, a travel photographer. Mann used an iPhone 6 to take otherworldly photos of an Icelandic glacier.

## Who Needs Expensive Gear?

These days, Mann is as likely to use his iPhone to take pictures as he is to reach for an expensive camera.

Professional photographers often feel they need a lot of expensive gear, like a $1,000 lens, he says. Seeing they can take great photos with just an iPhone encourages people to "shift away from focusing on gear and equipment."

Technology is not only allowing us to cut costs, it is also changing the way we create.

New technology has certainly meant big changes for painter Roz Hall, another of Apple's 12 featured artists. Hall once painted on canvas in the traditional way, but then he began experimenting with an iPhone app called Brushes. He went from making life-size paintings to working on a 3.5-inch screen.

One of the things Hall likes about digital painting is that it doesn't involve any preparation. When an idea strikes, he can get right to work.

## Let Your Fingers Do The Painting

With traditional painting, he said, artists have to spend hours gathering materials, stretching canvas, mixing paints, and so on. By the time they are ready to start, they may no longer feel inspired.

Hall, who lives in Britain, has shown his work in many cities, from San Francisco to New York to Shanghai. He has not painted traditionally for many years, he says. Instead, he now uses the app Procreate, which allows him to paint with his fingers on his iPad.

Some artists look at digital painting as "cheating," because it makes it so easy to erase mistakes. Hall thinks being able to erase mistakes easily is a good thing, because it makes artists more daring. Artists take more chances, he says, because they are not worried about expensive mistakes.

"If you spent 50 pounds ($75) on canvas and another 50 pounds on paint," he says, "at some point you are going to get careful" about scrapping what you have already done. "You don't want to waste what you spent."

## See It, Photograph It

For the Apple project, Hall used the Procreate app to paint pictures of various people he encountered. One picture shows a bearded, mustached young man with bright yellow glasses and an intense stare. Another shows a thoughtful-looking woman in a floppy black hat.

Alistair Taylor-Young, another of Apple's featured artists, has been a professional photographer for many years. For the Apple project, he used his iPhone 6 to take shots of rainy city streets.

Taylor-Young bought an iPhone in 2007, just after they first came out. The early iPhone's picture quality was not very good, he says, and the camera was pretty basic — for example, there was no way to focus. Still, he liked the fact that is was very simple to take pictures. "You just saw something and took a photo."

## It's Always There

The quality of phone cameras has certainly improved in the last several years. However, two other factors have been more important: The cameras are very easy to use and they are always there when you want them, since people carry their phones with them all the time.

Because smartphone cameras are so simple and always at hand, they encourage picture-taking. In the past, most people took photos only rarely, in order to record special events or trips. Today, many of us use our cameras constantly to capture daily moments.

People who might not have "thought of taking pictures, or sharing them" are using their smartphones to record the world around them, Taylor-Young says. Photography is now something everyone can do.
