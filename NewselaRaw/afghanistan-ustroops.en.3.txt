WASHINGTON, D.C. â€” President Barack Obama said on Thursday that the United States will keep nearly 10,000 troops in Afghanistan through most of next year. He added that there would still be 5,500 U.S. troops in Afghanistan in 2017. The president leaves office in January of that year.

Obama had promised to end the war next year. Now, the war will be handed over to whoever becomes the next president.

Obama said he knows Americans have grown tired of the lengthy war in Afghanistan. However, he said he is "firmly convinced we should make this extra effort."

## Afghan Troops Need Help Pushing Back Taliban

Military leaders have argued for months that the Afghans need more help from the United States. Afghan troops have been trying to keep Taliban fighters from taking over the country.

The Taliban once controlled all of Afghanistan. They forced their own kind of Islam on the country. Like Christianity, Islam is a religion with many different forms. The Taliban's kind of Islam is very unfair to women and to anyone who thinks or acts differently. When the Taliban ran Afghanistan, they threw many people in jail and killed many people as well.

In 2001, the United States and several other countries forced the Taliban out of power. Elections were held and a new kind of Afghan government then took over. Now, the Taliban is fighting to retake control.

On Thursday, Obama said Afghan government forces have been fighting well. However, the Taliban is still very strong. Without U.S. help, Afghan government forces could end up losing the fight.

## U.S. Troop Numbers Will Drop In 2017

Under the new plan, the 9,800 U.S. troops who are now in Afghanistan will remain there through most of next year. The number of troops will then drop by about half by 2017.

It will be up to the next president to decide what to do after that. Whoever it is, that person will be the third president to oversee the war.

The president's new plan gives U.S. military commanders everything they requested. It gives them all the troops they wanted. It also gives them the power to decide how to use those troops and when to begin bringing them home.

U.S. troops will not only be fighting. They will also need to train and help Afghan government forces. Without U.S. help, Afghan forces could end up losing their war against the Taliban.

The situation in Afghanistan has gotten worse recently. Last month, Taliban fighters took control of the important city of Kunduz. Afghan government forces then fought a long battle to recapture the city. U.S. fighter planes provided help by bombing Taliban fighters.

## Islamic State, Taliban Are Both Threats

U.S. commanders are not only worried about the Taliban. They are also concerned about Islamic State fighters moving into Afghanistan from other countries in the region.

The Islamic State is also known as ISIS. It wants to start its own country under Islamic law. Its fighters have taken over parts of Syria and Iraq. Islamic State is considered even more cruel and dangerous than the Taliban. U.S. commanders are worried that some Taliban fighters may join the group.

Talks about staying in Afghanistan longer began in March of this year.

The top U.S. commander in Afghanistan is General John Campbell. He recently showed Obama several possible military plans he had developed. All involved keeping U.S. troops in Afghanistan longer than was originally planned. The troops were needed to keep the Afghan army strong and able to fight, he said.

Military experts like Campbell say the United States cannot afford to let the Taliban win any more territory. If the Taliban regains control of Afghanistan, much will be lost. The country could go back to the days before 2001 and years of progress will be wiped out.
