LOS ANGELES  â€” Comcast Corp. will buy Time Warner Cable Inc. for about $45.2 billion in a deal that combines the nation's top two cable TV companies. The combined company would be a dominant force in both creating entertainment and delivering it to U.S. homes after the deal is final.

The deal was approved by the boards of both companies. It is expected to close by the end of the year, pending shareholder and regulatory approvals.

The price amounts to $158.82 per share for Time Warner Cable and is about 17 percent above that stock's Wednesday closing price of $135.31. It beats a proposal by Charter Communications Inc. to buy Time Warner Cable for about $132.50 per share. The Charter offer is worth about $38 billion in cash and stock.

## Taking On Debt To Make Money

Time Warner shareholders will end up owning about 23 percent of the combined company once the deal is final.

Charter had pursued Time Warner Cable for months, but Time Warner Cable CEO Rob Marcus had consistently rejected the offer, saying it was too low. He said he would cut a deal for $160 per share in cash and stock.

For a time, Comcast, which also owns NBCUniversal, stayed in the background, waiting to purchase any chunk of subscribers that a combined Charter-Time Warner Cable would sell off. Subscribers are the people who pay for cable television.

Charter had planned to pay for its bid with $25 billion in new debt. As part of a plan to pay off the debt quickly, the company considered selling off some of its territories after a deal had closed. Time Warner Cable's Marcus was against the huge debt burden the Charter takeover represented.

## Competition From Cell Phone Companies

Instead, Comcast now plans to sell off 3 million pay TV subscribers after the deal closes. With 22 million of its own pay TV customers and Time Warner Cable's 11.2 million, the combined company will end up with about 30 million subscribers. It is believed that having that number of subscribers is not enough to worry antitrust authorities, who scrutinize mergers. Their job is to make sure that a company does not become so big that it can raise prices on consumers and suppliers without worrying about competition. Selling off some territories of subscribers could help the deal get approved more quickly.

Comcast argues that Comcast and Time Warner Cable don't serve overlapping markets. So their combination won't reduce competition for consumers, Comcast says. Comcast operates mainly in the Northeast including its home base of Philadelphia and places such as Boston, Washington and Chicago. Time Warner Cable has strongholds around its headquarters in New York as well as Los Angeles, Dallas and Milwaukee.

In many of those areas, the combined Comcast/Time Warner Cable will face competition from rivals AT&amp;T and Verizon. Those two companies provide both pay TV services and Internet hookups. Both AT&amp;T and Verizon are growing quickly. They ended 2013 with 5.5 million and 5.3 million pay TV subscribers, respectively.

Comcast and Time Warner Cable are expected to save $1.5 billion in annual costs over three years.

## Schoolyard Bullies

Comcast also plans to add an additional $10 billion in share buybacks at the close of the deal. The company has already announced a plan to boost its share buyback authority to $7.5 billion from $1 billion. Some investors like it when a company buys back shares, because it can give remaining shareholders a bigger share of the company's profits.

Charter conceded that it lost the takeover battle. It issued a statement Wednesday saying, "Charter has always maintained that our greatest opportunity to create value for shareholders is by executing our current business plan." The company said that "we will continue to be disciplined in this and any other (merger and acquisition) activity we pursue."

Some groups opposed the Comcast-Time Warner deal. Public Knowledge, a Washington-based consumer rights group, said in a statement Wednesday that regulators must stop the deal, because it would give Comcast "unprecedented" power "in several important markets."

It said, "An enlarged Comcast would be the bully in the schoolyard."

Shares of Time Warner Cable jumped more than 12 percent, or $16.82, to $152.13 Thursday morning after the deal was announced. Comcast shares edged up a penny to $55.25.
