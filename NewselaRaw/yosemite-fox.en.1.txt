For the first time in nearly 100 years, the rare Sierra Nevada red fox was spotted in Yosemite National Park.

The red fox — one of 14 mammals protected by California — was seen on motion-sensitive cameras on Dec. 13 and Jan. 4. Park officials are still trying to determine whether the cameras caught the same fox or a different one.

"The chance of running into them is very unusual," park spokeswoman Kari Cobb said.

## No Humans Allowed

California's Sierra Nevada red fox is one of the most endangered animals in North America, Cobb said. Fewer than 50 of the bushy-tailed animals even exist on the continent.

The last time a red fox was seen at Yosemite was in 1915, she said.

The shy creatures avoid humans. They burrow in soil and logs at an elevation of 6,000 feet, according to the park's website.

Little is known about the foxes because sightings are so rare.

## Camera Shy

Photographs of the Sierra Nevada red fox were taken in 1990 during a study at the Lassen National Forest in California, north of Yosemite. Video cameras set up in the forest captured images of the reddish-orange colored fox.

Determined to photograph the fox again, wildlife biologists placed cameras in Tioga Pass. A Sierra Nevada red fox had been seen in the high mountain crossing years earlier.

In 2010, a red fox was finally captured on video, in Sonora Pass north of Yosemite.

The fox was videotaped biting on a bait bag containing chicken scraps.

University of California, Davis researchers analyzed samples of saliva from the bag. They confirmed its DNA came from a Sierra Nevada red fox.

## It's A Good Sign

Two years ago, Cobb and her husband spotted a red fox during a deer hunting trip at the Sonora Pass.

"They are extremely cute little animals," she said. "When you see them, they are pretty majestic."

Researchers will continue to look for the Sierra Nevada red fox. They have set up hair snare stations near video cameras to capture hair samples from the fox. Researchers hope to study the hair DNA to learn more about the fox and determine whether it is connected to the red fox seen at the Sonora Pass.

The latest sighting in Yosemite, Cobb said, is a good sign.

Yosemite's landscapes are vast and remote. They provide a protected habitat that could allow the Sierra Nevada red fox to possibly "make a comeback," she said.
