### PRO: U.S. must counter Russia's moves in Eastern Europe

WASHINGTON — The president sets U.S. foreign policy but, with regard to Ukraine, Congress has an opportunity to push the United States in a more fruitful direction. Republican and Democratic lawmakers should approve legislation put forward in the Senate that would give Ukraine $350 million in military aid to help it fight off Russia's advances.

Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine in March after Russian troops seized control of it. Russia had seen Crimea as its own, as many Crimeans consider themselves ethnically Russian and speak Russian.

Russian President Vladimir Putin dreams of resurrecting the Soviet empire, and going back to the Cold War era when Russia ruled over Eastern Europe, including Ukraine. He scoffs at U.S. and European actions to stop him.

He won't be stopped from seizing more of Ukraine by the U.S. and Western Europe imposing somewhat tougher sanctions blocking countries and businesses from trading with Russia.

## Halting Russia's Advances

That's important because Putin is not just trying to carve up Ukraine. No, increasingly, he's threatening the Baltic states of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. All of those countries are now members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military alliance led by the U.S. and Western Europe.

More broadly, Putin is threatening global peace and stability. During the Cold War, the U.S. and Soviet Union were the world's two superpowers, often on the brink of war with each other. Yet they kept the world mostly at peace. Now things are becoming more unsteady.

Only U.S. military aid to Ukraine's government holds the potential to stop Putin. So far we've given just non-military aid. As Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko told Congress recently with regard to U.S. non-military aid, "Blankets and night-vision goggles are important. But one cannot win a war with blankets."

For the U.S.-led West and its efforts to halt Putin's advances, 2014 has been a weak year. All it has done is verbally condemn Russia, impose limited trade sanctions and make weak military threats.

Far from disturbing Putin, the West's actions to date have only encouraged Moscow's strongman to push ahead.

## Russia Eyes The Baltics

After Russia took Crimea, in an election filled with fraud, Crimeans voted 95.5 percent to join Russia. U.S. and European leaders denounced the action, imposed limited sanctions blocking some Russian trade, and conducted military exercises in the area. None of those actions deterred Putin.

Then, Russia aided pro-Russia separatists in Ukraine, sent troops and arms across the border and cut off natural gas supplies on which Ukraine relies heavily. Russia then forced concessions from Ukraine as part of a cease-fire. Not surprisingly, Russian separatists have already violated it.

President Barack Obama vowed that "there will be costs for any military intervention in Ukraine," the United States and Europe ramped up sanctions and Obama visited Estonia to show U.S. support. Again, Putin barely noticed.

Regarding the Baltics, a top Russian official recently complained of discrimination against ethnic Russians and the Russian language. He's clearly laying the groundwork for a Ukraine-like intervention.

In addition, Russia seized an Estonian security official along their shared border and charged him with spying. It also captured a Lithuanian fishing vessel in what it said were Russian waters, and asked Lithuania to extradite some 1,500 former Soviet citizens to Russia, who supposedly hadn't fulfilled their military service to the Soviet Union.

## The U.S.-Led Global Order

Weak Western action is strengthening Putin. In mid-September, Russian nuclear bombers flew within 63 miles of Alaska's coast and 46 miles of Canada's, forcing U.S. and Canadian jets to intercept them.

Such Russian brashness comes as Moscow is upgrading its nuclear arsenal with new missiles, submarines and a new bomber. It has been test-firing new missiles and strengthening its forces and bases in the Arctic.

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved the $350 million in aid for Ukraine on Sept. 18. Congress should quickly follow suit and vote on it. Then President Obama should shift course and sign it.

Otherwise, we'll surely see more brazen Russian attacks both in Ukraine and beyond. They'll only force Washington to ponder what comes next and how much more it will let Putin chip away at the U.S.-led global order.

### CON: U.S. must help the cease-fire hold in eastern Ukraine

COLUMBUS, Ohio — President Barack Obama is right to reject the request of Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko for military aid of the lethal type. Poroshenko wants weaponry to fight Russian-backed separatist groups in his country.

Obama gave Poroshenko a feel-good moment during his visit to Washington by letting him speak to Congress, asking directly for weapons and generating applause from lawmakers. But in a meeting just after, Obama turned Poroshenko down. Obama will come up with military aid of a non-lethal type for Ukraine.

A cease-fire is in place — more or less — in Ukraine between its government and the separatists, who hold the major eastern cities of Donetsk and Luhansk. If the cease-fire holds, the warfare that has devastated some areas in eastern Ukraine will not continue. Giving Ukraine more lethal-type aid would risk raising tempers in eastern Ukraine at a time when matters seem to be getting resolved.

## What's Best For Ukraine?

Poroshenko has just made an important compromise, passing a law to give the separatists some independence, or autonomy, to rule the areas where they are concentrated. That law, along with the cease-fire, has set a path to a way out of the deadly conflict.

Obama's rejection of lethal aid does not satisfy everyone in Congress. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has called for lethal aid to Ukraine. But what the United States should now do is to help the cease-fire hold and make sure the new autonomy law goes into effect.

That law is a good first step toward giving the population in eastern Ukraine more control over local affairs. It will allow the people there to maintain the close ties that that area has historically had with Russia.

In the public discussion over a proper U.S. approach toward the situation, focus has been on U.S.-Russia differences. There is a tendency to see anything that looks like a gain for Russia as a loss on our side. The focus needs to be on what is best for Ukraine.

## Striking The Right Balance

Finding the right balance will not be easy. The new law on autonomy leaves unclear exactly which parts of eastern Ukraine are involved, and just what autonomy will mean.

One factor of some uncertainty is the desires of the population in eastern Ukraine. One segment of the easterners want nothing to do with Ukraine's government in the capital Kiev, which helps fuel the separatists to break away. But another segment of people in that part of Ukraine are comfortable with rule from Kiev. And perhaps a third segment just wants calm.

One key element in the new autonomy law is an assurance that the Russian language can be used publicly in eastern Ukraine, such as in schools, courts and local government. That is a good step.

Just what kind of relationship eastern Ukraine will have with Russia remains to be worked out. A takeover by Russia — as happened earlier in the year for Crimea — is not in the cards for eastern Ukraine. The central government and the separatists have to work out a solution that accommodates everyone.

The United States should promote that process. There is every reason to believe that an acceptable arrangement can be achieved that will end the bloodshed in Ukraine.
