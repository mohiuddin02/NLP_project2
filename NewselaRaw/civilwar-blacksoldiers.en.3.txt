ATLANTA, Ga. — The Confederacy was a group of Southern states that broke away from the United States. They separated from the North to protect the right of whites to own black people as slaves. The North was called the Union. It won the Civil War.

After the end of the war, two units of black soldiers were assigned to keep the peace in Atlanta, Georgia. The soldiers were once slaves in the south. Now, they carried guns and wore the blue suits of the victorious United States Army.

## An African-American Confederate

Several miles away, "Ten Cent" Bill Yopp was trying to find his place in the world. He was born a slave. During the war he was a Confederate drummer, shining boots for a living and tending to the wounds of his master, Captain Thomas McCall Yopp.

After the war, "Ten Cent" raised money for soldiers who had fought for the confederacy. He stayed by his former master's side in the Confederate Soldiers' Home in Atlanta. When he died in 1933, "Ten Cent" became the first and only African-American to lie in the Confederate Cemetery.

## Planning A Museum

Officials at Stone Mountain Park are learning about stories like this now. They are working to build a museum about blacks in the Civil War in the park.

If the museum is built, it will be the second museum of its kind in the United States. Frank Smith, a Washington, D.C. city councilman, built the other. It is called the African American Civil War Memorial and Museum.

It will not be easy to choose which stories to tell in the museum. 

## No Black Confederate Soldiers?

A few weeks ago, a group of Confederate flag supporters protested a plan for a Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial at Stone Mountain. They argued that the civil rights leader had no involvement in the Civil War, so he had no place on a Confederate memorial. The mountain has stone carvings showing famous Confederate leaders.

The protesters said they would support a monument for a black Confederate soldier. Yet they could not name any. Experts say there were none.

Service records kept by the National Park Service showed that all black soldiers who served in the Civil War fought for the North. There is no evidence that slaves fought for the Confederacy.

## Historian Can't Find Any

Kevin Levin is a historian in Boston. He has been working on his upcoming book, "Searching for Black Confederate Soldiers," for eight years. He has not found any.

Several Confederate websites report that there were blacks who voluntarily fought for the South, including "Ten Cent" Bill Yopp. Levin said he is one of a few slaves who websites have called loyal Confederates.

Historian Michael Thurmond said as many as 1 million slaves worked in some way for the Confederacy, "working in the back as cooks, digging trenches, making uniforms and supporting troops."

## "A Slave Cannot Volunteer"

"But that didn't make them Confederate soldiers. It made them slaves serving their masters," said Thurmond, a former Georgia government official. "A soldier is someone who volunteers. A slave cannot volunteer. … The Confederacy did not want to arm slaves," Thurmond said.

Neither did the North, at least early on. When the war started, both sides did not allow blacks in their armies.

General Robert E. Lee was the leader of the Confederate army. His image is carved on Stone Mountain. He wanted to arm slaves in exchange for their freedom after the war. The Confederate government voted against it.

## Freed Slaves Fought For The Union

"By November of 1864, the Confederacy was faced with the decision. 'Do we want to win the war or protect slavery,'" Thurmond said. "They picked slavery."

It was not until April 1865 that the Confederate Congress voted to arm blacks.

Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation on Jan. 1, 1863, freeing slaves in the South. After, about 200,000 blacks decided to fight for the Union.

Thurmond said, "The war ended before black Confederate soldiers could be deployed. It was over and there is no record of this. No official records show black soldiers in the Confederacy."
