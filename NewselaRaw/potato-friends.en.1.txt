PHILADELPHIA — The humble white potato has lately been at the center of a rollicking debate.

Congress is pushing hard to get the spuds included in the WIC program. Founded 40 years ago, WIC provides food for low-income women who are pregnant or breast-feeding, and their infants and children.

Senators and members of the House of Representatives say it is their right to get involved. Health advocates accuse Congress of improperly imposing itself on nutrition science.

The federal program — called the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) — gives coupons to poor women and children. Known as vouchers, these coupons can only be used for specific foods, such as milk, eggs and bread. Each item's inclusion is based on medical research into the particular needs of the WIC population.

## The Door Was Closed On Potatoes

Five years ago, WIC began to include fruits and vegetables. White potatoes were omitted.

That's not because potatoes aren't considered healthy enough, according to the Department of Agriculture (USDA), which runs WIC.

Rather, it is because the Institute of Medicine has determined that the women and children in the WIC population of 8.7 million already eat enough white potatoes — or nearly enough.

Saying that the exclusion makes potatoes look unhealthy, the National Potato Council has been pushing members of Congress to speak out. It has been approaching both Democrats and Republicans, many of them from potato-growing states.

This same group, with the help of Congress, took on the Obama administration in 2011 when the president wanted to limit potatoes in school lunches. In the end, the group was successful in forcing the president to back down.

## Science, Nutrition Or Common Sense?

Mark Szymanski, spokesman for the council, said the group was "encouraging Congress to reverse a policy not founded in good nutritional science or common sense." The Department of Agriculture, he said, is "singling out one item from the entire food basket and saying, 'Do not eat this because it's somehow lacking.'"

Senator Susan Collins, a Republican from the potato-growing state of Maine, praised the crop, saying it contained a lot of potassium, which is "important for pregnant women and new mothers." In fact, she said, potatoes contain more of the substance than bananas, which are often recommended as a source of potassium.

Meanwhile, nearly 100 nonprofit health and science organizations — including the American Pediatric Association, the American Medical Association, the National PTA and the March of Dimes — have joined to ask Congress to stay out of scientific matters.

"We strongly urge you to oppose efforts" to interfere with "science-based rules regarding the federal child nutrition programs," the organizations wrote last month.

Last Tuesday, around 100 doctors went to Capitol Hill to urge Congress to back away from potatoes.

## Potato War Declared

WIC officials, meanwhile, are furious.

"The National Potato Council has declared war on WIC," said the Reverend Douglas Greenaway, president and chief executive of WIC. "I would call it nothing more than industrial greed — this is all just a public relations battle on the part of the potato industry."

Advocates for the poor said they cannot tolerate what they see as congressional overreach.

Congress has never before interfered in this way, based on pressure from an industry, said Julie Zaebst of the Greater Philadelphia Coalition Against Hunger. "It's just ridiculous."

Zaebst said she worries that Congress is setting a dangerous example, one that would encourage other industries to push for "foods that wouldn't help families."

## A French Fry Is Not A Vegetable

White potatoes themselves pose a problem, said dietitian Chelsea Anderson.

White potatoes don't offer as many health benefits as other vegetables, she said. Another problem, she added, is that there are "not a lot of healthy ways people prepare them."

Doctor Hans Kersten agreed, saying, "I often hear women say french fries are their favorite vegetable."

White potatoes need not be villainized, said nutritionist Alison Ventura, who sees things a little differently.

"They're a very healthy part of a diet," she said. Nonetheless, she added, "young children's diets are much higher in french fries" than they should be.
