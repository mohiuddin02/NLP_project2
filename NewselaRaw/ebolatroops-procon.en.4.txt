### PRO: We have to help fight Ebola by sending troops

WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama sent U.S. troops to West Africa to help stop the Ebola outbreak. It was the right thing to do. But he did it for the wrong reasons.

Obama called it a "national security" mission. It is not.

Our government protects our national security. It uses the military to keep the nation safe.

True national security issues are caused by the violent actions of humans. It might be war between countries or attacks by extremist groups like al-Qaida. They threaten the lives of Americans.

## Helping People

Other types of challenges, such as bad bugs or bad weather, are different. They are just problems to be solved.

Helping West Africa deal with Ebola is a humanitarian mission. It is about helping people. It is not about security.

It is, of course, right for us to provide humanitarian aid when we can.

America sent humanitarian aid to help after the 2004 Tsunami in Asia.

The U.S. military often launches these kind of missions. Our military is skilled at humanitarian emergencies. It sandbags rivers during storms to prevent floods. After disaster strikes, it delivers supplies and rescues people.

It is not the main job of our military. But it should be done when U.S. troops are needed and available.

## Stopping The Disease

Deciding when to launch these missions depends on if they are right, can be done, and are acceptable.

Without question, the West African crisis is the right use of U.S. forces. The Pentagon can quickly send troops, experts, and support to help people there stop the disease.

And it's in our own interest. The best way to keep more Ebola cases from reaching the U.S. is to help defeat the outbreak in West Africa. Preventing people from traveling from West Africa does not fix the problem.

Sending troops to West Africa is also possible and acceptable. However, the mission will be risky for our troops.

Even health workers who try to take all the right safety steps have caught the disease. But, our troops know the ways to lower their risk.

They understand the danger. They accept it. It is part of the job.

### CON: We should not put our troops at risk

WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama is using American troops to fight Ebola. It shows the world he cares enough to send our best people. But he's putting them at risk.

Like many of Obama's plans, he is acting without thinking.

Here are four reasons why sending our military isn't the best way to help:

Our military is already doing too much. The president has decided to cut the Army from 570,000 soldiers to 440,000. A government study said this makes it difficult to deal with more than one large military problem at a time.

## A Dangerous Mission

Now the president will send 4,000 soldiers to West Africa. And that number is sure to go up. The president just decided to call up National Guard soldiers, who are off duty. The U.S. is also now bombing the extremist group Islamic State. And our troops may need to go fight that group soon.

These are big challenges. Army Chief of Staff General Ray Odierno recently questioned the plan to cut the number of U.S. troops.

Our troops risk getting stuck in West Africa. Besides giving humanitarian aid, our military might have to keep the peace as well.

International affairs expert Janine Davidson said, "As the disease spreads, so does panic — and panic leads to violence." Keeping the peace in African countries could be risky.

For one, it would take many more troops in the future, stretching our military even further. The World Health Organization says there could be 10,000 new Ebola cases each week by December. That could cause a lot of panic and violence. Our troops would need to keep the peace.

For another, it could place our soldiers in a position like the one Liberian soldiers recently found themselves. They had to choose between their safety and the public's. A neighborhood was put under quarantine and people were not allowed to leave their homes. Violent rioting started. It left four people wounded and one 16-year-old boy dead.

Imagine U.S. soldiers being forced to make the same choice: Having to shoot unarmed, possibly infected Liberians or allow Ebola to spread.

## Unstable Countries

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) isn't ready. All of the Ebola patients who caught the disease on U.S. soil were health care workers. They caught Ebola while treating it and using the instructions of the CDC. The CDC is not ready to help in Africa.

Bringing the military into humanitarian aid risks getting the U.S. dragged into the problems inside West African countries. All three countries at the center of the Ebola outbreak have weak governments.

Civil wars ended in Sierra Leone and Liberia not long ago. Guinea was ruled by the military until 2010. These countries could be so unstable that just stopping travel there from the U.S. could cause chaos.

"You isolate them, you can cause unrest in the country," said the National Institutes of Health's Anthony Fauci. "It's conceivable that government could fall."

Meanwhile, the Obama administration still doesn't want to stop travel from West Africa. Yet, it's the one way that might give Americans some protection.

Our soldiers face enormous risk. And it's all because the president is unwilling stop the flow of possibly infected people from West Africa.
