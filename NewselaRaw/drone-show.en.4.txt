WASHINGTON â€” Drone aircraft were not just firing missiles in Yemen last week. The planes were also sitting in a convention hall less than a mile from the White House. It was a clear sign that unarmed drones are coming to American skies soon.

[Drones](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone) are aircraft that do not have a pilot. They are flown by remote control. Some are as small as toy airplanes.

But the aircraft in the huge Washington Convention Center were anything but toys. They ranged from bird-sized craft to a model of a giant Air Force plane known as the hunter-killer drone. The drones can be used by the government and by businesses.

The three-day show featured nearly 600 exhibits. Companies were there to demonstrate how drones can help in all sorts of things. Policing, search and rescue, selling real estate and checking pipelines were all covered. So were fighting forest fires and protecting wildlife.

## Avoiding The Word Drone

But some people are afraid of drones. The drone makers to do something about that first. Most of the companies won't even use the word. They prefer names like "unmanned aerial vehicle." Or remotely piloted aircraft.

When people hear the word drone, they think of the U.S. using them to kill terrorists. And some Americans worry about something flying overhead and spying on them.

"Obviously the public is concerned," said David Ison. He is an assistant professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.

But all kinds of gadgets were being shown in the giant convention hall. People's body heat was being scanned invisibly by sensors. Others could operate machines that let them pretend they were flying drones over the mountains between Afghanistan and Pakistan. The machines are called simulators.

## Drones Over America

Drones for business are supposed to be flying over the country in two years. Experts expect that 10,000 unmanned aircraft could be flying overhead five years later. Big and small companies want to sell low-cost portable aircraft. There might be a lot of money to be made.

"This is a growth industry," said conference spokeswoman Melanie Hinton.

Drone technology is developing quickly. Things are getting cheaper to make. One company showed a drone that could be used in firefights, forest fires or other tasks where it might be destroyed. It's made of plastic foam. Magnets attach propellers and a camera to a two-foot wingspan. It can be folded and stored in a backpack.

Another company builds video cameras that can "see" heat. Jeff Leake works for the company. He pointed out footprints shown on a screen by people walking past.

"You can see the heat from their feet left on the floor," he said. The camera can pick up a temperature change of less than 1 degree Fahrenheit, he explained.

## How To Fly A Drone

Richard Becker spun a computer ball in another booth and hit a button. The screen showed a gray drone flying over a rocky valley in Afghanistan. A thin column of smoke could be seen at the end of a box canyon. "All this is exactly as you would see in real life," said Becker.

The machine is used to teach soldiers how to fly the ScanEagle. The craft is a drone used by the U.S. Army in Afghanistan. Its wings are 10 feet long.

Lt. Gen. James Barclay recalled how the Army at first did not want to even study how to use drones.

"I can remember back to early on in Army aviation, we said, 'Unmanned systems, no way; it's got to have a man in it,'" Barclay said. "Everyone was scared that ... at the end of the day, everything would become unmanned, and it would do away with our jobs and stuff."

He added, "But I will tell you that that's not the case. We know that it will bring better capabilities to our force. And that is the future of our Army."
