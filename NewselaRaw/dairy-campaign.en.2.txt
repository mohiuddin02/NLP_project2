Today, Americans are drinking much less milk than they once did. To help increase the sales of milk, dairy companies are fighting back. They have paid $500 million to start a new campaign to promote people drinking more milk.

One of the things the dairy campaign is pushing for is a new kind of milk carton. The cartons do not need to be refrigerated until they are opened.

In 2013, only about 6 billion gallons of milk intended for drinking were sold in the United States. Sales have not been that low since 1982.

According to the dairy companies, three things are behind the steady decline in milk sales. There are changing consumer habits, more drink choices, and not a lot of new dairy products.

## Drink Up!

Americans still consume about as many gallons of drinks per year as they did in the past. However, they are not drinking as much milk as they used to.

Tom Gallagher runs Dairy Management, an organization that promotes dairy products. Milk sales have fallen so much, he said, there may be no going back.

If the new campaign fails, Gallagher said, it might be impossible to slow the decline. At some point, the average American might not even consider milk as a drink choice.

The new campaign was launched by Dairy Management and seven other business partners. Among those partners is Dairy Farmers of America, which represents thousands of farmers nationwide.

Monica Massey is a Dairy Farmers of America senior vice president. According to her, it is essential for the dairy industry to create new products, such as flavored milk and dairy-based sports drinks.

Massey said the dairy industry has to understand what consumers are looking for in drinks these days. "We can't just put a gallon of milk on a shelf and hope someone buys it," she said.

## We Didn't Get Milk

To appeal to children, milk has been sold in small packages shaped like a cow's head.

There has also been more focus on packaging that allows milk to be kept unrefrigerated on a store shelf. Businesses save money if milk can be stored without having to be kept cold, as is already done with juice containers.

Massey said the new packaging will interest consumers as well, as they want more "grab and go" options.

There have been advertising campaigns for milk in the past, such as the one featuring the "Got Milk?" slogan. However, none of them managed to slow the sales decline.

The problem was the dairy industry lacked the products and packaging needed to attract consumers, Gallagher said.

"It would be like Coca-Cola doing great advertising but not having a product that matched it," he said.

## Eat More Cereal

Another problem is that cold cereal sales are declining, which means less milk is being poured on cereal.

However, sometimes new uses for even small amounts of milk can make a big difference. Quaker Oats, for example, has changed its oatmeal cooking recipe to include milk instead of water. The change could mean that millions more gallons of milk will be sold.
