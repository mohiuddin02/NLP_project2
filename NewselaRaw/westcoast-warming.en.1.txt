SAN JOSE, Calif. — Unusually warm ocean waters off the U.S. West Coast have brought some odd species to the area from far-away places.

Hawaiian ono are swimming off the California coast and a green sea turtle usually at home off the Galapagos Islands was found floating near San Francisco.

Rare changes in wind patterns this fall have caused the Pacific Ocean off California and the West Coast to warm to historic levels, drawing in warm-water species. The mysterious phenomena are surprising fishermen and giving ocean scientists a Christmas present in November.

Temperatures off the California coast are currently 5 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than historic averages for this time of year. It's the warmest autumn in 30 years.

## Winds From The North Slacken

"It's not bathtub temperature," said Nate Mantua, a scientist with the National Marine Fisheries Service in Santa Cruz, "but it is swimmable on a sunny day."

In mid-October, it was 65 degrees off the Farallon Islands and in Monterey Bay, and 69 degrees off Point Conception near Santa Barbara. In most years, water temperatures in those areas would be in the high 50s or low 60s.

The last time the ocean off California was this warm was in 1983 and 1997. Those were both strong El Niño years that brought drenching winter rains to the West Coast.

But El Niño isn't driving this year's warm-water spike, which began in mid-July, experts say. Neither is climate change.

What's happening is winds that normally blow from the north, trapping warm water closer to the equator, have slackened since the summer. That's allowed the warm water to move north.

## "It's Like The Refrigerator Fails"

In most years, the winds also help push ocean surface waters, churning up cold water from down below. That process, called upwelling, isn't happening as much this year.

"If the wind doesn't blow, there's no cooling of the water," Mantua said. "It's like the refrigerator fails. The local water warms up from the sun, and is not cooling off."

Mantua said researchers don't know why the winds slacked off — or when they will start again.

"It's a mystery," he said.

All year, scientists have been forecasting an El Niño, during which warm ocean water at the equator near South America can affect the weather dramatically. Now the water is only slightly warmer than normal at the equator and scientists say a mild El Niño is on the way, with less dramatic weather effects.

For people who study the ocean, this fall has been a wonderland.

"It's fascinating," said Eric Sanford, a professor at the UC Davis Bodega Marine Laboratory in Bodega Bay. "To see so many southern species in a single year is really a rare event."

## Common Dolphins Uncommonly North

Sanford and other researchers have documented more than 100 common dolphins off the Farallon Islands in the past two months. They're normally seen hundreds of miles away, off Southern California.

The scientists have scooped up a tiny species of ocean snail called the tropical sea butterfly, normally found far to the south. They also found a Guadalupe fur seal, normally found in Mexico, and a purple-striped jellyfish, which usually drift off Southern California.

In September, a fisherman off San Francisco caught an endangered green sea turtle. The turtle is an extremely rare find for Northern California, since the species usually lives off Mexico and the Galapagos Islands. The fisherman returned it to the sea unharmed.

Similar tales are turning up in Southern California, where fishermen and scientists have found Hawaiian ono. They also found tripletail, a fish species commonly found between Costa Rica and Peru, as well as other warm-water species.

In August and September there were even sightings of skipjack tuna and giant sunfish off Alaska.

"They are following the water temperature," said H.J. Walker, a museum scientist. "Fish come up against a cold-water barrier normally and turn around. But now they aren't encountering that, so they are swimming farther north."

## Broken Links Of A Food Chain

In many parts of California, salmon fishing was down. Squid were caught as far north as Eureka, which is unusual.

The ocean changes also have affected birds. Upwelling stalled this summer, meaning less krill and other food rose from the depths. As a result, several species of birds had high rates of egg failure on the Farallon Islands, 27 miles west of San Francisco.

"The krill that is usually present disappeared, and the fish that some of these birds rely on disappeared," said Jaime Jahncke, a director at a group that studies birds.

More common local species are expected to return when waters cool, as they did after the 1983 and 1997 warmings.

"It is an oddball year. But I'm not surprised," said Joe Welsh, who works for the Monterey Bay Aquarium. "These things come and go. There's a lot to learn out there."
