WASHINGTON â€” President Barack Obama asked Congress to raise people's pay and make sure poor people don't starve or go homeless. On Wednesday, he gave a speech. He said he wants to fix the things that he says make it hard for a child to escape poverty.

"That should offend all of us," he said. "We are a better country than this."

Obama focused on the household issues that he says Americans call a top concern. He argued that the dream of working hard and bettering your situation is breaking down. The growing income gap between rich and poor is a "defining challenge of our time," he said.

"The basic bargain at the heart of" the U.S. has been broken, the president said. He gave the remarks at a community center. It was a short drive from the White House to one of Washington's poorest neighborhoods.

## No New Laws, But A Vision

He offered no new ideas for laws. But Obama mixed a call for Congress to act on short-term bills he wants to pass with a big vision. There are a growing number of poor people in the United States. Obama wants to change this.

But there are some public doubts over Obama's ability to steer the way the country spends its money. Obama's speech served as a guide for the remaining three years of his term.

The speech drew attention to other laws he has tried to get passed. They ended in a government split in two. Obama owned up to his failures and the difficulties he has faced in his efforts.

He admitted that his health care website was flawed. It was meant to be an easy way to buy health care. But he still blamed Republicans for a "reckless" shutdown of the government.

## A Growing Poverty Problem

The speech came at a time when there is growing attention to the troubles poor and working people face. Pope Francis wrote recently against allowing the poor to suffer. Fast-food workers in the U.S. have led protests to get more money. Obama mentioned the pope's words. But he also spoke about his own personal story as a young boy with a mother who struggled to make ends meet.

Obama noted that in the United States, a child born into the poorest part of society has almost no chance of making it to the richest part of society. She is 10 times more likely to stay where she is. In countries like Canada, Germany and France, she would have a better chance.

Republican John Boehner blamed Democrats and Obama for not taking action on laws about creating jobs. He said bills passed by the Republican-controlled House that would help get people working have been blocked in the Democratic-controlled Senate.

## Political Fighting

Obama admitted that the main problem is the political fighting that has stopped Congress from taking action. But he used the health care law as one example that he said is already helping families. It gives health care to more Americans and is supposed to push down the costs.

Obama called on Congress to raise the nation's minimum wage. That is the lowest amount you can get paid for working. Right now, it is $7.25 an hour. A possible new law would raise the lower limit to $10.10 an hour.

A vote is not expected in December. But even if the law is debated, it seems unlikely to go through and pass.

Obama also asked the government to keep supporting the 1.3 million people who have not had a job for a long time. The program to give them the money is set to end just three days after Christmas. The extra weeks of support been made longer each year since 2009.
