WASHINGTON â€” Until now, Russians could eat all the food they wanted from the U.S. and Europe. They could buy French cheese and U.S. chicken at their supermarkets. Now, those foods won't be getting to the dinner table in Russia.

Russia said Wednesday it will block many European and U.S. foods. The food won't be allowed in Russia. It will put "trade sanctions" in place for one year. Many foods from Europe, the U.S., Canada and Australia will be blocked. They include all meat, fish, fruit and vegetables. Dairy products like milk, yogurt and cheese are also blocked.

Russia's action could hurt U.S. farms. Salmon from Washington state will not be allowed in Russia. Almonds and pistachios grown in California will be banned. But farmers raising poultry, like chicken and turkey, might be hurt the most.

## Russia Hitting Back

Russia added the sanctions to get back at the U.S. and Europe. The U.S. and Europe already had their own sanctions on Russia. U.S. and European sanctions targeted Russian companies and Russian leaders. The U.S. and Europe wanted to punish Russia for what is happening in Ukraine. Months ago, Russia sent troops into Crimea and took it from Ukraine.

The U.S. and Europe added even more sanctions a month ago. A Malaysian Airlines flight was shot down over Ukraine. Both the U.S. and Europe blamed it on a Russian missile. Fighters inside Ukraine are thought to have fired it. The fighters are supported by Russia.

The sanctions will cost U.S. farms about $1 billion a year. Russian companies are losing much more money than that. Sanctions by Europe and the U.S. have hurt them more, experts said.

Luckily, U.S. farms don't send as much food to Russia now as they once did, said Mike Cockrell. He's a boss at Sanderson Farms, a poultry producer. Cockrell said that in 2008, one-fifth of all poultry shipped from the U.S. went to Russia. Now, it is much less.

## Hurting Its Own People?

Yet, Russian sales are still important. Sanderson Farms shipped 88 million pounds of poultry there last year. It was worth about $40 million.

"Forty million dollars is certainly a lot of money," said Cockrell. But, he says, Sanderson Farms will try to send poultry to other countries. He said that the $40 million is only a small part of his company's sales.

It is not the first time Russia blocked poultry. U.S. poultry was banned in 2003 and 2004 and briefly in 2010.

The sanctions are a small problem for U.S. farms. They hurt the Russian people much more, experts said. Russian poultry costs more than American poultry. Russia has to buy food for its chickens from other countries. It drives up the price Russians pay.

Cockrell says the Russian people "are going to be the ones that suffer from this."

The U.S. sanctions target Russia's companies and leaders. U.S. sanctions do not hurt ordinary Russians, a U.S. official said. Russia's sanctions will cost all Russians more money to buy food.

Russia is placing sanctions "on their own people," said David Cohen. He is a U.S. government official.

Russia's government is making food harder to get. Cohen said it is something that the U.S. "would never do."
