Most of us think we know what happens when it rains. Water falls from the sky. Then the sun heats it up. It evaporates and goes back into the air. After that, it condenses. Then it falls as rain once again. 

That is only part of the story. 

## Is The Water Hiding?

There is also water inside the Earth's crust, or outer shell. The water there once fell from the sky. Then it trickled down into sand, water and rocks in the ground. The water there is called groundwater.

We cannot see groundwater, but it is important. There is more groundwater than there is in lakes or rivers. People in some parts of the world drink groundwater every day. In dry places like deserts, it is pumped out of the ground. It is used to grow food. It also helps keep streams and rivers running when there is no rain.

In the 1970s, scientists wanted to know how much groundwater there was. They made a guess. Now it is 40 years later. They want to make another, better guess. 

## How Old Is The Groundwater?

This time, scientists studied a bigger part of the world. They wanted to find out how long the groundwater had been buried underground.

Tom Gleeson is the man who led the study. He is a scientist who studies groundwater. He works in Canada, the country north of the United States.

## Scientists Get A Surprise

Gleeson and his team of scientists found new groundwater and old groundwater. Some of it has been there for less than 50 years. Some of it has been there for 1 million years, or even 1 billion years. Most of the groundwater was old. Gleeson said he was very surprised by this.  

Gleeson knows what he wants to do next. He wants his team to find out how much new groundwater is being used in the world. He also wants to find out where it is being used. 

Gleeson says it is important to find this out before the world runs out of groundwater.
