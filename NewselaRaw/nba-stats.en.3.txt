LOS ANGELES — From their office window, Rajiv Maheswaran and Yu-Han Chang can see Staples Center. Both the Los Angeles Lakers and Clippers basketball teams play there.

To see the future of the NBA, they can just turn their heads. Whiteboards inside their office are filled with step-by-step instructions to solve different problems. Programmers sit around computers typing in lines of code.

It might not make sense to anyone without a degree in computer science. But these numbers could help NBA teams find the best ways to improve their play. For the first time this season, cameras that track motion will placed in every arena.

Maheswaran and Chang have made software that can sort through all the numbers. "It's 1,000 times more information than anyone had before," said Maheswaran.

## From Whiteboards To Floorboards

On his laptop screen, Maheswaran displayed visual tools that teams could use to tweak lineups and position players. One showed a basketball court covered with green squares. The darkest squares show the most likely spots where a ball would fall depending on the shot taken.

Even the biggest supporters of this new system said that it should be only one part of a how a team makes decisions. Traditionally, teams looked at video of games and evaluations of players.

But the system Maheswaran and Chang have licensed to four NBA teams could change the way basketball is played.

The Golden State Warriors used a system like this last season from a different company. Kirk Lacob works for the Warriors. He said the team used the system's analysis of its defense, lineups and how tired players were. Then they made tweaks. It worked: teams no longer shredded the Warriors' outside defense.

Lacob said he doesn't know how much the information helped. "The most important thing is it did help us identify a problem and then eventually correct it," he said.

Six NBA teams used the cameras, starting with the 2010-11 season. Last season, 15 teams used them. The NBA recently decided to pay for every team to have the system. That would allow the whole league to have the information.

## Recording 25 Times A Second

It all starts with six tiny cameras placed in each NBA arena. They will record the movement of every player, referee and the ball 25 times a second. The information is electronically sent to a company to be put into categories such as passes, dribbles and shots.

Teams can get information such as the number of passes while games are in progress. More complicated information is available after the game once more numbers are processed.

Several teams have also hired people to make sense of all that information.

But, coaches may only pass on a handful of the information to their players.

"You can't give players a boatload of information," Los Angeles Lakers assistant Kurt Rambis said.

Players are conflicted about the value of this info: like, which players shoot after just two dribbles.

Clippers player Chris Paul is one of them. "If I just guard him and after two dribbles I stop, and he takes a third and I say, 'Hey, man, you're only supposed to take two dribbles,' then what?" Paul said.

## TMI?

All those numbers can be a bit much. Lakers center Chris Kaman said he was often overloaded with stats last season when he played for Dallas.

"It got a little bit annoying," he said. "Points per possession, per second half, per first quarter … this guy guarding this guy in this game or these five guys did good against these guys but not these guys."

The numbers can also track injuries. The Lakers will be able to see how Kobe Bryant recovers from a torn Achilles tendon. That could help the team's trainers make practice plans that keep him healthy for the rest of the season.

This new information can also be used by teams when they decide how much to pay players.

Maheswaran, 39, and Chang, 35, hope more teams leave the number crunching to them.

The two have worked together since 2005. They have worked on projects for the military involving the movement of vehicles. Chang says that it's great that they can go from "detecting enemy targets and tracking them to tracking our favorite players on the court."
