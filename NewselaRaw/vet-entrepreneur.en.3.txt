SAVANNAH, Mo. — Pet lovers and animal rescue groups love Gary Silverglat.

About 13 years ago, Silverglat began Angels Vet Expresscare. It gives medical care to animals. Now Angels Vet cares for 100,000 animals each year. Pet owners pay much less than at regular vet centers.

Veterinarians around the country are also paying attention to Angels Vet. They want to learn how Silverglat runs the center.

Its secret is caring for a large number of animals, Silverglat said. This way, it is able to charge less for each one.

## No One Turned Away If They Can't Pay

Yet, he said that Angels Vet was started with one basic idea. No animal is turned away because its owners cannot pay.

People in the United States love their pets. They spend much money on vet care. In 2014, Americans spent $15 billion, says the American Pet Products Association,

Vet care can be expensive. Treatment of a heartworm infection can cost $180 to $350\. Heartworms are long worms in an animal's heart or lungs. A heartworm infection can be serious.

Angels Vet charges just $67 to spay a cat, vaccinate and deworm it. Spaying keeps a cat from having kittens. For major operations, the price is just one-tenth the cost of a regular vet center.

## Clinic Treats Dogs For Training Program

Kathy Turner works for a rescue dog training program. The dogs are rescued from the streets and given a home. The dogs get vet care at Angels Vet.

"If it weren't for Angels Vet Expresscare, we wouldn't have a program," she said.

Angels Vet also helps families who do not have much money for pet care, said Jenny Hays. She works for BluePearl Veterinary Partners. The center sends some pet owners to Angels Vet. The clinic treats their animals very cheaply.

Silverglat has had a tough time building Angels Vet. He spent millions of his own money on it in the last 13 years. He does not make much money from Angels Vet.

## Animal Rescue Group Came First

Silverglat is not a veterinarian. He is crazy about animals, though.

He and his wife, Lisa, moved to the area more than 30 years ago. They saw a tremendous number of abandoned animals. Silverglat decided that they needed to take action. They started an animal rescue group. Soon, they realized they could save even more animals by giving them vet care.

Seven veterinarians work for Angels Vet. It also has a handful of volunteers who help out for free.

Angels Vet Expresscare sees about 60,000 pets each year. It also treats another 40,000 rescue animals. Many of the rescue animals are treated for free.

Running Angels Vet is not easy, Silverglat said. It takes much money and community help. "But in the end, we figured we could do more for the animals by treating them rather than holding them," he said.
