Have you noticed a difference in the appearance of United States presidents and the runners-up who lost the election? Former Republican presidential nominees Mitt Romney and John McCain appear to be healthy and chipper. Compare their appearance with a graying and often tired President Barack Obama.

If candidates for the highest political office in the land only knew the results of new research, they might be happier about losing an election. The findings might even whittle the huge pool of Republicans vying for the job.

A study regarding the lifespan of those elected to a parliamentary leadership position or presidency was conducted with nearly three centuries of data. The study found that after an election, losers lived four years longer than did the winners who went on to serve as heads of state.

Results needed to be adjusted to account for the fact that winners were on average a bit older than losers. Considering this, the study found that politicians who were elected live 2.7 fewer years than did hopefuls who failed to win higher office.

## Victory Has Its Downside

The authors decided that although being elected was a thrilling victory, it came with a downside. They said that getting elected to a country's highest office "may lead to accelerated aging due to stress of leadership and political life."

That claim has been controversial. Dr. Michael Roizen, a preventive medicine specialist at the Cleveland Clinic, has asserted that the typical president ages two years for every year he is in office. However, no data are available — yet — on how a woman would age in office. To draw his conclusion, Roizen used presidential medical records from the 1920s through today.

In the medical journal JAMA in 2011, human lifespan and endurance expert S. Jay Olshansky came to the opposite conclusion. He drew on the health and life spans of presidents from George Washington to the present. Olshanksy is a professor of public health at the University of Illinois, and he looked into those presidents who died of natural causes. He found that 23 of these 34 presidents "lived beyond the average life expectancy for men of the same age when they were inaugurated, even if they hypothetically aged at twice the normal rate while in office."

## Hit It Out Of The Park

The new study appears in the BMJ, a medical journal. Once a year, in the Christmas issue, readers are treated to a collection of papers that feature silly subjects explored with high rigor and serious subjects explored with fanciful methods. Last year, a paper conducted a thorough test of "male idiot theory" and concluded that, indeed, men are idiots.

The latest research adds to a surprisingly robust line of research: whether winning awards, honors and elections actually confers a long life. Past work in this field has found that Academy Award winners, those who win Emmy Awards and Nobel Prize laureates tend to live longer than do nominees who did not win.

One paper, published in 2013, found that those who were inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame did not fare so well. Unfortunately, those who were granted baseball's highest honor died on average two years younger than did their peers who were nominated but not inducted.

## No Clear Pattern In The End

Alas, when comparing the lifespan of political winners and losers, research has not found a clear pattern. The current study aimed to find a way around the methodological shortcomings that affected earlier studies. To do so, it analyzed almost three centuries of electoral results in several countries.

The nations studied were Austria, Australia, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden and the United States.

The researchers' earliest example drew from the 1722 parliamentary election in Britain.
