CARACAS, Venezuela â€” Helena Siso was in line for hours to buy groceries. She did not know why the stores were short on groceries and she did not care. She just wanted the government to do something about it.

Siso said it can drive a person crazy. It took three hours in line to buy toilet paper. She had to come back the next day to get corn flour.

The lines are getting longer and people are getting angrier. She will not shop at some stores. People push and shove to take everything and leave nothing for the rest, she said.

## President Is Not Very Popular

Many Venezuelans are angry with their president, Nicolas Maduro. The country's economy is weak. The government and people have less money, and not enough jobs pay well. In his last speech, Maduro did not say how he would fix it. Instead, he defended Venezuela's socialist government.

In a socialist economy, the government owns many businesses. People cannot buy and sell things on their own easily. The government sets prices for most things people need, including food. Venezuela has been a socialist country since Hugo Chavez was elected president in 1998. Maduro was his vice president. He became president after Chavez died in 2013.

## Oil Is Important

Venezuelans have to wait in long lines for sugar, cooking oil, soap, rice and other things. Many items are in short supply. Last year in Venezuela, food and other things people need to live got much more expensive. Their prices went up faster than anywhere else in Latin America.

Experts say Venezuela's economy will get worse this year. They say it is because oil is much cheaper now. Venezuela is a big oil producer. It sells oil to other countries to make money and help its economy. But the price of oil has dropped by half in the past few months. Because of that, Venezuela will make less money this year.

Maduro defended the socialist system in his speech. He said it is fair because it gives money to people who need it. Maduro blamed the United States for his country's problems. He said the United States was selling too much of its own oil. He said this is making Venezuela's oil too cheap.

## Many Store Shelves Are Empty

Ramon Diaz was standing in line at a supermarket in Caracas. He said you can't get many things in government stores. Thieves take items like milk before it gets to the stores. Then they sell the milk for more money, he said.

Jose Delgado, a janitor, was also in line. But he defended the government. He said people buy more than they need, so everything runs out fast.

Delgado is one person who still supports the government. Many Venezuelans said tougher times have not turned them against Maduro.

President Maduro said he would fix some things. He said the minimum wage for workers will go up. The minimum wage is the least amount of money someone can get paid to work. Maduro also announced more help for students to pay for school.

The higher minimum wage did not make many Venezuelans happy. They said it will not be enough. Things still cost too much money.

Carlos Frias spends every day standing in line for milk and diapers. The country is broke and Venezuelans have to deal with it, he said.
