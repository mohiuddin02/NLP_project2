LOS ANGELES â€” Should you have to hold Christian beliefs to lead a Christian student group? A new policy at California State University says no, and it is sparking a national debate.

InterVarsity Christian Fellowship is a national Christian organization for college students. Its members say they want to provide a welcoming space for all college students, believers and nonbelievers alike. But leaders in the group are required to hold Christian beliefs. As a result, it has found itself in a standoff with Cal State and other universities that require student groups must be open to all.

The conflict at Cal State began when the university changed its rules regarding student group membership. Under the new all-comers policy, a student can join any student group regardless of his or her personal background. Groups also cannot choose leaders based on their religious beliefs.

## Losing Privileges

InterVarsity and some other Christian groups refused to sign on to Cal State's all-comers policy. As a result, Cal State removed them from the list of official student groups, and they lost a number of university privileges.

Unofficial groups can still meet on campus. However, they no longer get free or cheap rooms to meet in. They cannot participate in official student fairs or receive money from campus student associations.

InterVarsity members consider the new policy unfair. Leadership positions, they argue, should be held by students who fit a group's values. For example, leaders in InterVarsity lead Bible study and prayers. InterVarsity says they should believe in the religious teachings they are passing on.

Critics say the policy silences religious groups. Gregory L. Jao works for InterVarsity. He argues that the policy forces out religious groups from campus communities. By saying that groups cannot choose leaders based on religious beliefs, he says universities suggest that religion has no place on campus.

## A Matter Of Principle?

For some in InterVarsity, not signing the all-comers policy was a matter of principle. "I don't think a non-Christian would want to be a leader in a Christian group," said Cal State Long Beach student Jasmine Kim. Regardless, Kim argues that Cal State violated InterVarsity's rights.

The policy does not just apply to religion, however. It says that no student can be shut out based on his or her background or beliefs. This means that a Republican could lead a Democratic student group. A white undergraduate could lead the Chinese Student Association. A nonmusician could be selected to lead the classical guitar club.

Cal State is not the only university confronting this issue. Other universities across the country have added similar policies. They are also wrestling with the same tough question: Should religious groups be held to the same standards as everyone else?

The question has made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court. In 2010, the court heard a case regarding a Christian group at a California law school. The group was denying membership to gay students. The court ruled that the law school could choose to not allow the student group.

## A Nationwide Issue

Since then, universities have become tougher on groups that are not open to everyone. InterVarsity and other Christian groups were denied recognition at Vanderbilt, Tufts and other universities for not agreeing to all-comer policies like the one at Cal State.

The conflict at Cal State is especially important, though. InterVarsity has hundreds of members throughout Cal State's 23 campuses. Cal State is the nation's largest university system, with 450,000 students.

Some legal scholars say that what is happening to religious groups on college campus is happening across the country. They argue that religious groups have less independence than they used to.

## Open To All?

One such critic is Edward Whelan, president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. His group believes religious values should guide decisions of national leaders in Washington.

He argues that Christian groups should be able to choose Christian leadership. He claims that this is freedom of association and the constitutional right of individuals to meet and form groups. Part of this freedom, he says, is the right of groups to set their own standards and choose their own leaders.

Other experts, however, say the Cal State policy is legal as long as it is applied to everyone. Lawyer Daniel Mach is with the ACLU, a group that favors the rights of individuals. He pointed out that universities are not keeping Christian groups from meeting. The new policy only affects whether a student group is officially recognized. Universities will not prevent students from associating. However, Mach says they will only fund and support groups that are open to all.
