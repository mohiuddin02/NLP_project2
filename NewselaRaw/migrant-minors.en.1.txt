MIAMI â€” Irene Granados turned 16 two years ago while walking through the desert, trying to reach the United States.

Brothers Javier and Denis Giron, 13 and 17, also came to America. They floated on a raft across the Rio Grande last year.

These young people were all fleeing Central America, where gang violence is spreading, and life is not safe.

More and more children and teenagers are crossing the Mexican border into the United States. They are often traveling without parents or other adults.

## Hoping For A DREAM

In recent years, the number of minors, or young people, arrested by border police has risen sharply. Between 2004 and 2011, about 6,800 children were arrested each year.

But in 2012, police caught 13,000. And in 2013, there were 24,000.

Officials estimate that up to 120 youths are arriving in the United States each day.

Some young people, like Granados and the Girons, leave their countries to escape gang violence. Other children are sent by their parents, who hope they can become U.S. citizens if Congress passes new immigration laws.

President Obama has called on Congress to pass the DREAM Act, new laws which would help immigrants who were brought to the U.S. when they were under 16. The DREAM Act, if it becomes law, would make it easier for those brought to the United States as children to become permanent U.S. residents.

But Granados and the Giron brothers had to find a different way to become legal residents.

Arriving safely in the United States was only the first step for them. Once they arrived, they hoped to get a green card, which would give them the right to stay legally in the United States.

In order to qualify for a green card, they must show in court that they have been abandoned, abused or neglected.

Granados and the Girons are in the process of applying for green cards now. All three are being helped by lawyers from the DuaneMorris law office in downtown Miami. These lawyers are working "pro bono," which means they are donating their time, working for free.

The cases involving Granados from El Salvador and the Giron brothers from Honduras are among the first to surface in South Florida. The three youths were recently interviewed at the DuaneMorris office.

## A Birthday In The Desert

Irene Granados' journey began in her hometown of La Union, near the Pacific coast of El Salvador.

"I had a problem," Granados recalled. "Someone wanted to harm me."

When asked for details, Granados said gang members were threatening to steal her belongings as pressure for her to join.

She said her mother and other relatives told her the best thing to do was to flee to the United States, where she had an aunt living in Florida.

"So I began my journey," Granados recalled.

Though Granados traveled without her parents or any other relative, she was not alone.

She was part of a group a "coyote," or paid guide, was leading to the United States. It often happens that Central American migrants who want to reach family members in the United States pool their resources to pay smugglers to guide them along the way.

Granados and her group traveled by bus from El Salvador to Guatemala and then all the way to northern Mexico, a journey of more than 2,000 miles.

From northern Mexico they walked into the Sonora Desert toward Arizona. Granados, who was 15 when she started the voyage, turned 16 while walking in the desert. It was Dec. 23, 2011.

Then immigration police caught the group and held Granados in Arizona. Eventually, Irene's aunt from Florida found her there and convinced the police to let her take her niece home.

## "I Want To Be A Doctor"

Local lawyers working pro bono began trying to get Granados a visa. They explained to a court in West Palm Beach, Fla., that Irene's father had abandoned the family when she was still a child and that her mother left later.

Now Granados is hoping to build her life in the United States.

"I want to be a doctor," she said.

The Giron brothers began their journey out of their native Honduras on Feb. 7, 2013. They traveled in a car with a guide and five other teens ranging in age from 13 to 16.

It took the group 11 days to travel from Honduras to Guatemala to the U.S. border between Texas and Mexico, where the border is marked by the Rio Grande River.

On the Mexican side of the border, in Reynosa, the Giron brothers and the other teens boarded an inflatable raft and the guide paddled them across the river toward McAllen, Texas.

Once on the U.S. side, the guide left the teens by themselves after telling them to keep walking until the Border Patrol showed up.

They walked for seven hours through a field until they saw a Border Patrol vehicle. The officers arrested the teens and took them to a detention center near the border.

The Giron brothers were held there for two months until an older brother, who lives in South Florida, picked them up.

"We miss our family in Honduras, but we finally feel safe here," said Javier Giron.
