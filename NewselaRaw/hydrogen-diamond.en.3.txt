At room temperature, hydrogen is normally a gas. Scientists recently took the first step toward making it a solid. They think that in its solid form, hydrogen will be a shiny, gray metal.

The experiment was described in Nature, a magazine for scientists.

Hydrogen is the most common element in the universe. Stars are made almost entirely out of the stuff. Hydrogen is an essential ingredient in the building blocks of life. Water is made up of hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen is extremely lightweight. Most of the time it is found as a gas, in the form of two hydrogen atoms bonded together. It is also the simplest atom in the universe.

## Trying To Understand Hydrogen

In spite of all this, not much is know about what happens to hydrogen in extreme conditions, said Philip Dalladay-Simpson. He is a physicist at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, and he studies how matter and energy interact across the universe. He is an expert in how materials behave under high pressure, high temperature and high strain. Dalladay-Smith is one of the scientists who did the experiment.

Not much is known about hydrogen gas because it is pretty rare in Earth's atmosphere. On Earth, it normally remains a gas, and it never becomes a solid. That is not the case with other planets such Jupiter. Jupiter is a gas giant and contains enormous amounts of hydrogen under extreme pressures and temperatures. Hydrogen is a gas in Jupiter's atmosphere, and it is thought to be a liquid and solid inside the planet. 

Understanding hydrogen helps us understand the stars and planets around us.

## To Solidify, Hydrogen Needs Extreme Pressure, Mild Temperatures

We know a little bit about how hydrogen changes under different conditions. Hydrogen can become a liquid at extremely cold temperatures. It has long been used as liquid rocket fuel. At high temperatures like those found in the sun, it becomes a gas called plasma.

In 1935, scientists predicted that hydrogen could become solid. It would have to be put under extreme pressure, but at mild temperatures.

Actually making solid hydrogen has been far more difficult than scientists ever thought, Dalladay-Simpson said. They have put hydrogen under enormous pressure, but nothing happened.

## Sharpened Diamonds Do The Work

Dalladay-Simpson and other scientists had a different idea. They took a small amount of hydrogen, about the size of a single human red blood cell. They crushed the hydrogen between diamonds, just like the diamonds used in diamond rings. The tips of the diamonds were polished to very fine points, about the width of a human hair. The scientists kept the temperature at a comfortable 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Yet, they put more pressure on the hydrogen than found at the center of the earth. 

The structure of hydrogen began to change in important ways. It is hard to say what it looked like, but it might resemble layers of hydrogen. Scientists think they might have made the first stage of solid hydrogen.

The next step would be to raise the pressure even more. Dalladay-Simpson said that should not be too hard.

## Solid Hydrogen Could Change Technology

Dalladay-Simpson said that one day people might make solid hydrogen in large quantities. If this ever happens, it could change technology.

For example, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machines take pictures inside the body. They are like X-rays. The machines are very large, and could be made smaller with room-temperature solid hydrogen. Solid hydrogen would also make electronics work much better.
