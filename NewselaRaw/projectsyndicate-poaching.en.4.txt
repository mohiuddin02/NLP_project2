NAIROBI, Kenya — White rhinos were common in Africa 50 years ago. Today, only around 25,000 are left. 

The animals are hunted for their horns. 

## Killing Animals For Ivory

People turn rhino horns into powder. Then, they eat or drink the powder.

Africa also has many fewer elephants than it used to. Fifty years ago there were around 15 million. Today there are just 470,000 left. 

Elephants are hunted for their tusks. Also known as ivory, tusks are long, pointed teeth. They are carved into all sorts of things.

Both ivory and rhino horn are very popular in Asia. Because of that, prices have gotten very high. Elephant ivory now sells for $1,500 a pound. Rhino horn costs $45,000 or more. 

## Poaching Gets Worse

Both animals are supposed to be protected. They are hunted anyway, because of those high prices. Such killing is against the law. It is known as poaching. 

Around 50,000 elephants were poached in 2013. There are now only about 50,000 left in all of Central Africa. 

In Mozambique every single white rhino has been poached. There is not one left alive.

Poaching has been getting worse. In 2007, only 13 rhinos were killed in South Africa. Last year, poachers there killed 1,215. South African rhinos may soon die out completely.

## Trying To Protect Animals

It has become much harder to protect the animals. They are no longer safe even within wildlife sanctuaries. Such sanctuaries were set up to keep the animals away from hunters. Still, poachers sneak in.

Kenya's Ol Pejeta sanctuary is home to 133 rhinos. Guards must watch it 24 hours a day. There is no other way to keep poachers out.

There is something to be happy about, though. China has just outlawed the sale of ivory. China is the world's largest ivory buyer.

## Don't Buy Any Ivory!

Things are also getting better in parts of Africa. In Kenya, fewer rhinos and elephants are being killed.

All of us can help save rhinos and elephants. We must not buy things made out of ivory or rhino horn. We must not take them as gifts. 

## The World Must Act Quickly

Ivory and rhino horn could become less popular. Enough people just need to stop buying it. Then, prices will drop. If prices drop, there will be less poaching.

The world must act quickly, though. Rhinos and elephants are disappearing. Soon, there could be none left at all.
