BEIJING — When Ma Wenfeng was a boy, the last thing he dreamed of was becoming a farmer. His father earned next to nothing growing wheat and corn. The family was so poor it mainly ate steamed bread.

Now it is his greatest hope to start a farm — but not in China. In his country, the word "farmer" pretty much means "peasant." Most Chinese farmers are old and poor. Their farms are small and don't grow much.

More and more these days, the Chinese are looking overseas. They are hoping to find big stretches of farmland to use. On such land, food is already being grown for the Chinese back home.

The Chinese have been focusing on many far-off places: the United States, Chile, Brazil, Russia, Ukraine, Bulgaria and Australia. They are also busy in several African countries.

## Buying Big

China is getting wealthier very quickly. This has led to a huge demand for food, said Ma. "When we look overseas, we see large tracts of land where you can operate a farm."

Chinese interest in overseas farmland makes perfect sense. China has one-fifth of the world's population. However, it has less than one-tenth of its usable farmland.

Farming in China has long been difficult. There is much too little rain. As a result, much of the land is gradually becoming desert. Recently, China has added to its problems: a lot of its land has become too polluted for farming.

"We want to bring American sunshine, land and water back to China," said businessman Zhang Renwu. He himself owns two farms in Utah.

Last year, a Chinese company bought a vast amount of U.S. farmland in Missouri, Texas and North Carolina. It totaled more than 100,000 acres.

In Australia, a Chinese company also bought big: It took over a huge 200,000-acre cotton plantation.

## Renting Farmland

In 2012, there were at least 54 large Chinese farms outside the country. Together these covered almost 12 million acres.

China's overseas farming takes many forms. Large companies are setting up plantations in Africa. These are growing corn, rice, cassava and sesame.

Smaller Chinese businesses have been busy in Russia. There, foreigners are not allowed to buy land. Chinese companies have instead rented farms.

China's interest in foreign farmland has many people worried. They think it is unfair to the countries whose farmland China is using. And they fear that China will suck up the world's food. After all, China has 1.3 billion people to feed.

This past September, many were upset over one particular Chinese company. It announced it would be taking over a huge stretch of Ukraine's farmland: up to 11,562 square miles.

A farm that size would be almost as large as Belgium or Maryland. Moreover, much of Europe's food comes from Ukraine.

The company quickly denied it had any such ideas. Nonetheless, it is now farming in Ukraine. However, it is farming much less land than originally announced.

## Overseas Holdings

Chinese companies operating in Africa have been particularly criticized. Some have accused the Chinese of taking advantage of Africans.

It would be wrong, though, to just point the finger at China. China is far from the world leader when it comes to using other countries' farmland: The United States comes in first. And at least six other countries hold more overseas land than China, or around as much.

But China is closing the gap fast. In 2012, it controlled almost twice as much overseas farmland as it did in 2010.

"It is only the last two years that the big agricultural companies are going overseas in a big way," said Ma. "I think you will see much more."
