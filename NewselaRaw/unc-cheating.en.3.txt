RALEIGH, N.C. â€” Students at the University of North Carolina (UNC) were allowed to take fake classes and receive A's and B's, a new report says. Many of the students were athletes.

The fake classes and dishonest grading went on for almost 20 years before ending in 2011. Now, UNC is struggling to deal with the consequences of this scandal.

More than 3,100 students took these fake classes over the years. The classes were in the African and Afro-American Studies department (AFAM).

The head of the AFAM department, Julius Nyang'oro, and an office secretary, Deborah Crowder, were at the center of the scheme. They have both retired.

## The Grade Game: A Or B

According to the investigation, counselors who worked with student-athletes encouraged them to take certain classes in the AFAM department.

These classes did not require students to attend class. All that was required was a research paper at the end of the term. These papers always got a grade of an A or B, whether they were good or not. The investigation explained that Crowder looked over the research papers and signed Nyang'oro's name to the grade lists.

The dishonesty was allowed to continue for years for a couple reasons, the new investigation found. First, the AFAM department was not examined like other academic departments because it did not have any graduate students, only undergraduates.

Nyang'oro was not reviewed by fellow professors because he was a department chairman.

## Some People Kept It To Themselves

UNC's current leader is Chancellor Carol Folt. She was appointed to the job after the cheating ended. She said the scheme would have been caught sooner if it hadn't been for those two reasons. The rules have been changed and departments and their chairmen will now be reviewed.

The investigation also found that school leaders and teachers saw warning signs of the cheating, but did not act on their suspicions.

"It really isn't something that you could look at as only one thing," the chancellor said. "We have to accept full responsibility for it."

## Follow The Rules

Crowder and Nyang'oro are gone, and the made-up classes ended in 2011. However, the university is still being watched closely by two organizations. Both want to ensure that UNC is an honest school that follows the rules.

The first group watching UNC is the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). This group examines schools to make sure they are offering a high-quality education and gives them a sort of stamp of approval.

Belle Wheelan is president of the Commission on Colleges at SACS. Her commission is sending UNC a letter, asking the school to show that it is following all necessary rules and standards to get the commission's approval.

"What we would do is ask them: is this bigger than you thought it was, what are you going to do now? It's a mess," Wheelan said.

## NCAA Is Curious As Well

The SACS has had UNC on its watch list until this summer. It has also required the school to allow students who took a fake class to take another class for free.

"We are interested in making sure that the students don't run into problems trying to explain any degrees that they have after the fact as a result of this," Wheelan said.

The 77 board members who oversee the university will discuss the cheating problem at a meeting in December.

The NCAA, the group in charge of college sports, is also investigating the false classes at UNC. If coaches knew that athletes were taking fake classes, past wins and championships could be taken away from UNC sports teams.
