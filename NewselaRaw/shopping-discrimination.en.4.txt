Black people shopping in expensive stores are often treated badly. But recently a black teenager also got held by the police. He says he was just buying a belt.

Trayon Christian said he was wrongly arrested after buying the $350 belt. He was shopping at Barneys in New York. Barneys sells expensive clothes.

This is a familiar story to African-Americans. Many are used to finding that their money is not as good as everyone else's. Shopping while black, they say, can be an upsetting experience.

Oprah Winfrey once said that a clerk did not think she could afford a $38,000 handbag. Even President Barack Obama has said he was once followed in stores.

## Asked Lots Of Questions

But many people don't realize how common this unfair treatment is. Natasha Eubanks is black. She said: "Don't ever tell me it doesn't happen to me." Eubanks runs a website. She often shops at expensive stores in New York. Eubanks said you can't think it doesn't happen just because it doesn't happen to you.

She said that sometimes it takes clerks five minutes to speak to her. The assistants often ask black shoppers lots of questions. They ask what they do for a living. Eubanks said this has happened at least 20 times to her in New York.

Trayon Christian's problem was different. It was not how he was treated when he went into Barneys New York. It was what happened after he left the store. The 19-year-old said that he bought a belt at the shop. When he left, he was stopped by police officers.

Christian said the police told him he "could not afford" the belt. He says he was held unfairly. Two other young black people also say they were badly treated after shopping in New York stores.

Yvonne Chan once worked in a shop in a mostly white town in Massachusetts. Every few months someone would be caught stealing. About half the time it was a black person.

Chan said she always tried not to judge people on the color of their skin. But the student admitted that she found herself watching black people more carefully. She added that she wanted to consider everybody equally. But she said she did think of groups of people differently due to her experiences.

## Blacks Watched More Than Others

Jerome Williams is a business professor at Rutgers University. He says viewing people unfairly changes how many people are arrested.

Some people say black customers are more likely to steal. But one study showed that white women in their 40s did more stealing than other groups.

Professor Williams explained that white women don't show up in crime figures. These women are not always caught. Clerks don't watch white women as closely as they watch black customers.

Black college student Dido Kanyandekwe knows when he is being watched. But the 18-year-old said that when he sees assistants looking at him he jokes with them. Kanyandekwe says "Hello, I see you" to guards. Or he just waves at them.

The student was in Barneys on Monday buying a $600 pair of sneakers. "Most black people don't have the money to buy stuff at Barneys," said Kanyandekwe. He is the son of rich parents. "But that does not mean all black people are not able to buy these things."

Black people are not the only ones who face unequal treatment. Hispanic shoppers say they experience the same thing. And Sher Graham is a white woman who lives in Alabama. She said black servers in restaurants often wait on black customers first. But the experience is most common for African-Americans.

## Too Quick To Judge

Candace Witherspoon went to a store to buy a purse. She said the assistant didn't greet her properly. Then she was ignored. Witherspoon saw that white customers were treated better.

The assistant said "Thanks ladies for shopping. Have a good day" to the other customers. Witherspoon said the clerk gave her a nasty look and didn't say anything when she left.

Toni Duclottni runs a fashion website. She went to a department store planning to spend about $4,000 on shoes. But she spent the money in another shop after she was ignored.

Duclottni said that store clerks should behave differently. She believes they should just treat everybody the same. Some assistants rush to judgment without speaking to a person. But Duclottni said they would be surprised if they just asked "Hello, can I help you find something?"
