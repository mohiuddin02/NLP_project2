Professional basketball player Jason Collins made history last week when he revealed he is gay.

The 34 year-old NBA player broke the news in an essay he wrote for Sports Illustrated. The story received a lot of attention in the press. No other active player on a major league basketball, football, baseball or hockey team has ever come out of the closet publicly.

Collins began his essay: "I'm a 34-year-old NBA center. I'm black. And I'm gay. I didn't set out to be the first openly gay athlete playing in a major American team sport. But since I am, I'm happy to start the conversation."

Since 2001, Collins has played for six different NBA teams. Before the Wizards, he played for the Boston Celtics and the Atlanta Hawks.

Collins explained in his essay that he first knew he was gay when he was just 12 years old. His twin brother was developing an interest in girls, but Collins was not. Collins wrote he felt whole as a person when he finally came out to his aunt. Her reaction was warm and loving. From then on, he knew he would always have support.

## Bombings Triggered Decision

Collins decided to make his announcement after the bombings at the Boston Marathon on April 15. He wrote that the tragedy made him realize he could not wait for the perfect moment to come out of the closet. "Things can change in an instant, so why not live truthfully?"

Collins felt public opinion was shifting in his favor. More and more, Americans seem to be accepting of gay rights, he wrote. On Thursday, Rhode Island became the 10th U.S. state to legalize gay marriage. Delaware followed on Tuesday.

"We still have so much farther to go," he wrote. "Everyone is terrified of the unknown, but most of us don't want to return to a time when minorities were openly discriminated against."

## Positive Public Reaction

Collins has gotten much support. Just hours after the story broke, President Barack Obama called him. The president said Collins' courage impressed him.

"He seems like a terrific young man, and I told him I couldn't be prouder," the president told CNN.

Collins wrote that he was not sure what the reaction of his fellow basket players would be. But if the news this week has been any indication, he has nothing to worry about. NBA stars Kobe Bryant and Steve Nash of the Los Angeles Lakers went to Twitter to show their support.

Bryant tweeted, "Proud of @jasoncollins34. Don't suffocate who u r because of the ignorance of others." Nash wrote: "The time has come. Maximum respect."

## Breaking Stereotypes

Collins has been a tough player on the court over his 12 seasons in the NBA. In the 2004-2005 season alone, he had 322 fouls, more than any other player.

"I'm not afraid to take on any opponent. I go against the gay stereotype, which is why I think a lot of players will be shocked: *That* guy is gay? But I've always been an aggressive player, even in high school," he wrote.

Even though Collins got lots of praise, not everyone was supportive. An NFL player tweeted a negative remark following Collins' announcement. But Michael Rosenberg of Sports Illustrated noted that the tweeting football player receive a mountain of angry backlash. He deleted his tweet and publicly apologized.

"He [Collins] didn't have to respond â€¦ people responded for him," Rosenberg wrote.

Everyone will be watching to see where Collins goes next. His contract with the Wizards is over and he will be a free agent this summer. That means any team can offer him a job. Whoever hires him will get a lot of attention. It will show that the NBA is open to gay players.

On Tuesday morning, Collins appeared on Good Morning America to discuss his announcement. "I think, I know, in my personal life, I'm ready, and I think the country is ready for supporting an openly gay basketball player," he said.

"I know that I, right now, am the happiest that I've ever been in my life," he added.
