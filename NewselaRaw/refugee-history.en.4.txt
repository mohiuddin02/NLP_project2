In 1939, Sol Messinger was 7 years old. His family left Germany on a ship called the St. Louis. World War II was about to start. It was a terrible time in history. Germany attacked many countries in Europe. Germany also killed Jews and treated them badly because of their religion. Messinger is Jewish.

The United States did not let the ship land. Messinger's family ended up coming to the U.S. later. Yet, many of the Jews on the St. Louis were killed.

Messinger is now 83. He said it was terrible that the U.S. turned the ship away. The Jews were not a threat to the U.S.

Now, a different group of people want to come to the U.S.

## Syrians Seeking Safety In America

They are from Syria. Their country is at war. President Barack Obama wants to let in 10,000 Syrian refugees. They are called refugees because they have left their country to find safety. Some Americans do not want them to come because many of the Syrians are Muslim. On Nov. 13, a violent group killed many people in Paris, the biggest city in France. 

The group is called the Islamic State. They follow their own idea of Islam. It is different from what most Muslims think. Some people worry the group will try to sneak its fighters into the U.S. with the refugees.

People are comparing the Jews then and the Syrians now.

There are differences, experts say. Also, some things are similar.

## We Kept Out Others Escaping War

During World War II, the U.S. did not let many refugees into the country. Some government officials did not like Jews. People worried Germany would try to sneak spies into the U.S.

Luis Gutierrez is a lawmaker in Illinois. He said the U.S. felt bad about sending Jews back to Germany. He said the U.S. will regret not letting in the Syrians.

Ian Tuttle does not agree. He writes for the National Review magazine. He said there is one big difference. The Jews were not trying to attack the U.S. like the Islamic State group is.

## Help For Those Who Are Suffering

Robert Krakow is in charge of the SS St. Louis Legacy Project. The group studies the history of the voyage. It also got the government to apologize for sending the ship back.

Both Jews and Muslims are human beings, he said. Both groups suffered. The U.S. did not help the Jews. Now it can do something to help the Muslims, Krakow said.
