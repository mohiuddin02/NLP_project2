LOS ANGELES — Spencer Hawes has spent seven times as long playing basketball professionally for the NBA as he spent playing at the University of Washington. He starred for the school for only one season before being picked in an NBA draft.

The Clippers forward-center was on campus so briefly he did not even choose a major. He later discovered that the classes he took had little relevance to his basketball career.

"No offense to some of the sciences and humanities and whatnot," Hawes said, "but it's not really my passion." His studies, he said, did not prove "to be that helpful later on in life."

Still, there is something tugging at him to complete his coursework: He promised his mother he would do it.

## Degrees Are In The Works

Hawes is nothing unusual for the Clippers. There are 11 current players who do not have a college degree and all plan to eventually get one.

Four have graduated: J.J. Redick, Ekpe Udoh, C.J. Wilcox and Dahntay Jones. Of them, Jones has already started work toward a master's degree in business and Redick said he would also like to get a business degree once his playing career ends.

It would be easy for NBA players to be indifferent about their college degrees when they already have millions of dollars in the bank.

In addition, they rarely have a day off during a season that can last eight months, and they like to spend summers training and traveling.

"It's just so hard to do it," point guard Austin Rivers said of going back to college. "You're so busy during the season and when you finally get time off, it's like, do you want to go to school or actually spend time with your family?"

A degree would take some extra doing for Rivers because he spent only one year at Duke University. He said he would prefer to take courses in the summer, meaning it could take seven or eight seasons to get his diploma.

## His Father's Footsteps

The reward for all that work would be a degree from a top U.S. college, which could lead to a job in television broadcasting and later coaching.

Austin's drive to finish college is inspired by the experience of his father, Doc, who returned to Marquette University during summers early in his own basketball career. Doc Rivers finished his degree and went on to become a sports broadcaster. He now coaches the Clippers.

"I went back my first two years in the NBA," the elder Rivers said. "Everyone told me, including my professors, 'If you didn't go back right away, you're probably not going back,' so I went back."

## Each Player's Unique Decision

The big debate among players who choose to go back to school is whether or not to be on campus. Many like the convenience of online classes, but others have picked majors that require more direct involvement with classmates and teachers.

"Drama major is kind of hard online," point guard Nate Robinson said. "It doesn't really make any sense."

Robinson needs to finish one more year of coursework toward a degree he hopes will help him develop as an actor. He has already co-starred in the "Uncle Drew" Pepsi commercials alongside Cleveland's Kyrie Irving.

Veteran forward Hedo Turkoglu is unique among his Clippers teammates because he never spent a single day in college. Having started his professional career in Europe when he was 16, Turkoglu was ineligible to play at the college level in the United States, where college players must be amateurs, and never received money to play. He said he would like to eventually get a degree in business management.

"Hopefully," Turkoglu said of going to college, it will make things "a lot easier when I stop playing."

For forward Jordan Hamilton, attending college at all was an achievement. As a teenager he was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and from seventh to ninth grades he received 22 Fs. Hamilton took medicine to help him combat the disorder and was accepted to Texas, where he spent two years before turning pro.

Now Hamilton hopes to complete a degree in communications that would allow him to become a television host after his NBA career.

## The Goals Are Set

Some might wonder why twenty- and thirty-somethings would bother going back to school when they are already extremely wealthy. Clippers point guard Chris Paul has made roughly $116 million in salary alone during his 10 NBA seasons. On top of that, he has earned a lot of extra money from starring in a series of State Farm Insurance ads.

"A wise man once told me, 'If you've got money, you don't need a degree,'" quipped center DeAndre Jordan, who was drafted by the Clippers after one year at Texas A&amp;M University.

Jordan then turned serious and said he would like to finish college because it is what his grandmother has always wanted him to do.

Paul said he intended to take classes at Wake Forest University in the coming months because he expected to spend the summer at home in North Carolina.

Paul is resolved to earn a college degree — he wants one almost as much as he wants to win an NBA championship.

"I told my mom, even if I have to walk with little Chris," Paul said, referring to his 5-year-old son, "I'm going to get it."
