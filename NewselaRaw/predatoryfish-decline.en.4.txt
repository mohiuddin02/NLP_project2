Predators are animals that hunt other animals. Top predators are large animals like sharks and tigers. No other animals hunt them, except humans.

Humans have overhunted and overfished top predators. Their loss can cause serious problems. Their disappearance is as harmful in the sea as it is on land.

Top predators are at the top of food chains. Food chains can be thought of as a series of levels. Each level relies on the one below it for food.

An ocean food chain might start with plant life. Small animals like shrimp eat the plants. Small fish eat the shrimp. Large fish eat some of the smaller fish. This keeps ocean life in balance. A group of food chains is known as a food web.

## Catching The Big Fish First

People like to eat the larger predatory fish. Among such fish are grouper, tuna, swordfish and sharks. People are usually less interested in eating smaller fish lower on the food chain, like sardines.

Naturally, fishermen try to catch the fish people most like to eat. After all, they are worth more money. As a result, fisherman go after the bigger fish first.

The result is something called "fishing down the food web." Fishermen go after the more valuable predators first. They fish them until there aren't enough left. Then they move on to smaller fish that are lower on the food chain. The bigger fish start to disappear.

A new study brings alarming news. It shows a very big drop in the number of predatory fish. Humans have reduced their numbers by more than two-thirds. Most of the loss happened since the 1970s.

## Unhealthy Oceans

Many kinds of predatory fish are known to be in trouble. Some are in danger of dying out altogether.

Much more is at stake than not having enough of the fish people like to eat. Predators keep ocean life in balance. Their loss affects the entire ocean.

For example, sea urchins have been growing in number. Their population growth is due to the loss of predators that eat them. Sea urchins eat the plant kelp. Because there are now more urchins, kelp forests are being destroyed. Kelp forests are home to many important kinds of sea creatures.

Professor Villy Christensen led the new study. Big predators, he says, play an important part in keeping the ocean healthy. It can be very difficult to bring them back once they start disappearing.

In the United States, things are looking better than they once did. The improvement is due to careful fishing.

## Limits On Fishing Can Help

U.S. fishermen are only allowed to catch a certain number of fish. The number they are allowed to catch is known as a quota.

Worldwide, though, the picture is not as good. Many kinds of fish are still overfished. Their numbers are much too low.

The main problem, Christensen says, is that some countries do not control fishing enough. He says if they don't start to soon we will have serious problems.

Christensen's new study shows how delicate food webs are. It helps us understand how many fish can safely be taken from the ocean. It shows how much we have been overfishing.

To bring back large predatory fish, more would need to be done. Fishermen would need to obey the fishing quotas. Many quotas would need to be lowered.

Taking these steps is the only way to save predatory fish. We need them around if we want healthy oceans in the future.
