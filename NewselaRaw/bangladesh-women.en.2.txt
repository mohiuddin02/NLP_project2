DHAKA, Bangladesh â€” Mukhta Mollah nimbly smooths the red material as she guides it through a sewing machine. She sews side seams on women's blouses bound for America. She spends eight hours a day, six days a week in this hot, sweaty factory. Sometimes she works even more than that.

On this day, like every workday, she will try to sew 1,000 blouses.

Other seamstresses sit all around her in rows that stretch across the factory floor. It is crowded with 350 workers. Bright lights buzz and blink above them while enormous fans nosily push around the air that smells like new clothes.

Mollah has long grown used to the harsh factory conditions.

## "My Life Is Much Better"

Mollah knows that she won't get rich. She sends nearly half of her $20-a-week wages home to her family. Still, she's grateful that the salary, no matter how small, gave her the means to escape her home village and the fate of her schoolgirl friends.

All of them were married before they turned 16, all have children of their own, and all have moved in with their husbands' families. They must get permission to leave the house.

"For them, it's a cage," said Mollah, 19. "My life is much better than theirs because they have no freedom. When I go back to my village and see my friends, they ask me, 'Can you take us with you?'"

Bangladesh's garment industry has gotten a reputation for harsh and sometimes deadly working conditions. An eight-story factory collapsed last April, crushing more than 1,100 workers. Six months before that, a factory fire killed 112 people. They could not get away because their bosses had locked the doors to keep them working.

Even though there have been horrible accidents, the picture of the poor, abused garment worker is complicated. There is not much else available for women in this poor, traditional Muslim society. About 5,600 factories in Bangladesh employ more than 4 million people. Ninety percent of the workers are female.

## Sharing An Apartment

It's not as big of a change as starting college or starting a job, said Sajeda Amin. She studies the effect on society that the garment industry has. But these jobs, she said, have given girls more independence and freedom.

Mollah's two-bedroom flat is two blocks away; it is in a concrete structure with metal bars and shutters on the windows, but no glass panes. She lives there with three other young women.

The four live in a very small room, with a ceiling fan and a bare light bulb. Two sleep on a double bed, two on a pad on the concrete floor. The women switch places every other week and split the $45-a-month rent.

All share a "toilet," which is a porcelain-lined hole in the floor, and a common kitchen with a low stool and two gas burners that sit on the floor. They cook in the kitchen and eat in their room.

Mollah and her roommates show off their apartment with pride, even though road dust blows through the windows, forcing them to keep their clothes bundled in bags.

## Seen As A Role Model

Kanchi Hazi, the more outgoing of the roommates who constantly makes the others laugh, said she considers the sleeping arrangements luxurious compared to those at the small house she shared with her parents, six sisters and two brothers.

The 24-year-old with a gap-toothed smile left her home village seven years ago to take this factory job. She sews pockets on blouses and works as many hours as she can get.

"I like it here," she said, arms akimbo, with fists on her hips. "I make my own decisions. I can earn money and help my family."

With overtime, she makes $78 a month and sends half of it home. Her father cannot always find work. Every few months, she makes the three-hour bus ride home to visit her family. Villagers are sometimes happy for her, but they are sometimes upset.

Some adults praise her, she said, because "I'm the only wage earner in the family." Others scold her for taking a job in a factory where men and women work together. It's just not a proper place for a young, unmarried woman to be, they lecture.

But when she steps off the bus to visit her family, younger village girls dance around her. "They see me as a role model," Hazi said. "I can do whatever I want. I can enjoy myself. I have freedom."
