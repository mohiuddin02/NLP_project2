CHICAGO, Ill. â€” Cancer is a terrible illness. It kills many people.

Cancer hurts cells inside us.

We are made up of cells. There are trillions of them inside us. They are so small we cannot see them.

## Cancer Starts When Cells Are Hurt

Cancer starts when cells are hurt. The hurt cells grow out of control. Then they spread. If they keep spreading through the body, it can kill a person.

Elephants have many more cells than people do. After all, they are much bigger than us. Yet they do not get cancer very often.

Until now no one knew why.

## Elephants Have More Anti-Cancer Genes

Scientists think they have found the answer. It has to do with a gene called p53. Genes are inside of cells. They tell cells what to do.

There are many different kinds of genes. They do many different things. Scientists believe the p53 gene helps to fight cancer.

People have one p53 gene in each cell. Scientists wanted to see how many elephants have. They looked at other animals too.

It turns out elephants have many more p53 genes than people. They have more than all other animals.

Scientists say each elephant cell has 20 of the genes. They keep elephants safe from cancer.

## New Knowledge Could Keep Cancer From Growing

The scientists looked at more than 60 kinds of animals. Only elephants have so many p53 genes. The rest have only one in each cell. They have the same number as people.

What scientists learned might help fight cancer. They might find a way to give people more p53 genes. The added genes could keep cancer from growing.

Elephants might have shown us something very important. They might help us stop cancer.
