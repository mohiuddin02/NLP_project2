FARMINGTON, N.M. — During World War II, Tom Jones Jr. served as one of the legendary Navajo code talkers. These [Native American](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=native+american) Marines used their own language to send secret messages the enemy was never able to figure out. Years later, the Navajo Nation set out to express its appreciation: It built him a house.

These days that house is in bad shape. The 89-year-old Jones struggles to keep warm during winter. His only source of heat is the antique wood stove in the living room. What's more, the electricity doesn't work in his bathroom and the floor has worn away. Rough plywood can be seen beneath his feet.

Jones is one of many Navajo who once served in the military who now live in homes that are often as ruined as those they saw in battle. Some of these veterans have no electricity or running water. The hallway in Jones' small home is too narrow for his wheelchair.

"My desire is a house where I can be able to get around, to have a heating system so I can sleep well and enjoy life," Jones said. He was speaking in the Native language of Dine, with which he spoke for the U.S. and its allies through the war.

## "A Huge Crisis"

Nearly 9,000 military veterans live on the reservation, which straddles the New Mexico-Arizona border. More than half of them live in substandard housing.

"There is a huge crisis taking place," said Rick Abasta, spokesman for Navajo Nation President Ben Shelly. "You'll even see some families living in storage sheds due to the housing situation."

The tribe began constructing homes for veterans during the 1980s. And a $6-million trust fund for Navajo veterans created by the tribe allowed the launch of a home-building program in 1998.

The aim was to provide houses — free of charge — to veterans in need or help them pay for home repairs.

"These veterans, they deserve housing — decent and sanitary housing — for the services that they provided this country. And that would probably go even more so with our Navajo code talkers," Abasta said.

In February, Navajo leaders signed a contract with Home Depot to purchase building materials for veterans' housing.

It's part of a $1.9-million project, paid for by the Veterans Trust Fund. But that's just enough for 75 homes. There is a long list — in the hundreds — of veterans who are waiting for housing.

## Housing Program Criticized

There is only so much the tribe can do, Abasta said, because of limited funding. "We meet with congressmen about these issues, but most often it falls on deaf ears," he said.

Navajo veterans and their supporters say the program is run poorly.

Etta Arviso works to pressure leaders to provide housing for several code talkers. She said veterans tell her they face too much paperwork, rules and other red tape. Other veterans can't bear the wait and give up hope.

"Now you can see how our Navajo code talkers are treated," Arviso said. At Jones' house she has placed a sign out front: "Navajo Code Talker Needs a New Home."

Jones would like to move, but he can't afford to.

He is forced to spend most of his time in the living room, since he can't get his wheelchair through the narrow hallway leading to his bedroom or bathroom. His caretaker or a family member has to carry him into other parts of the home.

## Disappointed And Disgusted

When the military asked him to join 73 years ago, Jones said, he was told that he would have whatever he needed after the war. He served as a corporal in the 3rd Marine Division from 1943 to 1945. A good portion of that time was spent on the front lines of heavy fighting, including at Iwo Jima.

When he returned home, he said, he was able to provide for himself. At one point he worked in the mines. When he was younger he never asked for handouts, he said proudly.

"I was strong," he said. "I would haul wood. I didn't have problems money-wise."

But in 2007, he got ill and he could no longer provide for himself. Jones has kidney disease and undergoes treatment twice a week. He has a hard time hearing and can barely talk.

Jarvis Jones, 37, who followed his grandfather into the Marines, said he was disappointed and disgusted with how his grandfather and other code talkers live.

"It's a lot of runaround," the younger Jones said. "The story on the reservation is 'We have no funds.'"
