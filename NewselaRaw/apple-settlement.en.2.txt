WASHINGTON — When Jackie Nussbaum opened her credit card bill, she saw $600 in charges from Apple for just one day.

Nussbaum knew her son liked playing "DragonVale" on the family iPad. "DragonVale" is a colorful game where kids raise adorable dragons. What she didn't realize was that he was buying virtual gems — with real money — to build his dragon park as part of the game.

"I thought it was a mistake, that someone had stolen my credit card," said Nussbaum. She is the mother of two children from Westerville, Ohio. Apple told her the charges were made while someone was playing the "DragonVale" game.

"I almost choked," she said. "It was shocking."

## Purchases Without Parents' Permission

Tens of thousands of people who received similar shocks complained to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC is the federal agency that protects consumers against fraud and unfair business practices. On Wednesday, the agency announced that Apple had agreed to refund at least $32.5 million to parents whose children made app purchases without permission.

"You cannot charge consumers for purchases they did not authorize," said Edith Ramirez. She is the chairwoman of the FTC.

Too often, the FTC said, parents were unaware that their children were making in-app purchases. These are purchases made within an app to buy things like special prizes, higher levels or extra points. And Apple didn't do enough to make it clear to parents that their children were buying gems, coins, or treats for their virtual pets. Parents also were not told that entering their password to buy a single app started a 15-minute clock. During that time, kids could make unlimited purchases without entering the password again.

As part of the agreement, Apple also must change the way it bills customers. Apple must make it clearer that a purchase is connected to a game or app.

Apple CEO Tim Cook said the California-based company gave in to the FTC. The agreement reached by Apple and the FTC "does not require us to do anything we weren't already going to do. So we decided to accept it rather than take on a long and distracting legal fight."

Apple has made sure its app store is a "safe place for customers of all ages," Cook said in a memo to company employees.

In Nussbaum's case, she called Apple right away. The company refunded her the $600 that her son, Andrew, had racked up. Nussbaum said Andrew, who was 10 at the time, had no idea he was buying gems with "real money." He felt so bad, she said, he was going to sell his old toys to pay her back. Because his mom got her money back, he didn't have to sell his toys.

Nussbaum also said Apple helped her set up passwords for in-app purchases. She hasn't had a problem since.

## Pet Hotel Cost One Kid $2,600

Other parents haven't been so lucky. One parent told the FTC her daughter had spent $2,600 in "Tap Pet Hotel," in which children can build their own pet hotel. The game is free to download and play. But kids must pay for extras, like bowls of treats and sacks of coins for the game.

Others parents reported unauthorized purchases by their children. These totaled more than $500 in "Dragon Story" and "Tiny Zoo Friends."

The FTC settlement brings up the same issue raised in a class-action lawsuit that Apple resolved last year. A class action lawsuit is a suit brought on behalf of a large number of people. In that case, Apple agreed to contact 28 million of its app customers. Apple is offering them a $5 store credit or a $30 cash refund if their children had spent at least that on apps without their parents' permission. The deadline for filing a claim was Monday.

About 37,000 people filed claims for refunds, according to Cook's memo to employees.

"It doesn't feel right for the FTC to sue over a case that had already been settled," Cook wrote. "To us, it smacked of double jeopardy." Double jeopardy, which is illegal, means trying someone in court twice for the same crime.

Apple's app store is a gold mine for independent software developers, as well as for the company. Apple charges 30 percent of the price of all app purchases. Apple says its customers spent more than $10 billion on app purchases last year. That figure includes the price charged by some apps for the software. It also includes income from purchases made while playing a game or for other services.

In November, children's apps sold in Apple's store brought in about 44 percent of the revenue from purchases made while using the software, according to the research firm App Annie. The remaining money came in from fees required to download children's apps from Apple's store.

In the FTC case, Apple must pay full refunds for kids' purchases no matter how much that comes to. The $32.5 million is the least amount it must pay. As part of the settlement, if the refunds total less than $32.5 million, the FTC would get the difference.
