Timothy Cade had only owned his hoverboard for three days. Then, it exploded under him.

"Hoverboard is on fire," he says in a video taken right after he jumped off of it. "What is going on dude?"

## Up In Flames

The bow-shaped board does not really "hover," or float above the ground. It is more like a cross between a skateboard and a Segway. It flamed and popped angrily.

His mother ran out with a box of baking soda. Baking soda can put out grease fires. Still, it did not help the hoverboard problem. The toy hissed and boomed, then the battery pack went shooting out of it. Flames engulfed the board.

"You would not expect a fire like that to come out of a little thing like that," Cade said. He was on his town's TV station, WKRG.

However, they do. Not just out of Cade's board, but at least 10 others. What was once the hottest toy of the holiday season has become something of a hot mess.

## Assault By Battery?

Airlines will not allow hoverboards until they can figure out what is going on. Online stores like Amazon will no longer be selling some types. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission regulates the sale and making of thousands of different goods. It announced this week that it will be looking into hoverboards. It will try to find the cause of accidents related to hoverboards. There have been 29 hospital visits and at least 11 fires, The New York Times newspaper wrote.

The problem, it seems, is the batteries.

Hoverboards use lithium-ion batteries. In a hoverboard, the batteries are kept in the foot rest. There are hundreds of companies making hoverboards. Not all of them follow the safety rules. When it comes to lithium ion batteries, a few shortcuts can have dangerous results.

## Explosive Technology

Lithium ion batteries are rechargeable. They do not weigh much. They can be used over and over again. This makes them appealing for electronics ranging from cellphones to electric cars.

However, these batteries are made with a highly flammable material, explained Wired. Wired is a magazine that covers technology. 

The lithium ion battery can explode. This does not just happen in hoverboards. Ipods, which also use this type of battery, have gone up in flames, too.

Still, batteries in hoverboards face problems that an iPod does not. For one thing, no one is standing on and riding iPods at high speeds. Hoverboards are ridden hard. This makes their batteries more likely to get damaged.

## Stricter Rules Needed?

For another, there are few rules about hoverboards, which worries Elliot Kaye, who is in charge of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.

Speaking to The New York Times, Kaye explained that hoverboard makers use strange manufacturing practices. Many of the manufacurers are in China. They can avoid rules in other countries.

There are no rules on how hoverboards must be made. Right now, it is easy for manufacturers to get away with making poor goods, he said.
