YOKOHAMA, Japan â€” Many countries fought in World War II. The war ended 70 years ago.

Japan and the United States were enemies. Japan took about 132,000 soldiers as prisoners. Many were American. The prisoners were forced to do hard work. They were given very little food.

This week, nine of the American prisoners went back to Japan. They are all about 90 years old.

## Men Remember Those Who Died

The men started the trip with a service. They went to a cemetery. They put flowers on graves of soldiers who died. They also visited some of the places where they were held prisoner.

Their trip had a purpose. After 70 years, it is time to forgive.

George Rogers lives in Virginia. He said he is not angry at the Japanese. George is now 96 years old. In 1942, he was taken prisoner by the Japanese.

George was a prisoner for more than three years. He did not get enough food. He was forced to work in a steel factory. Sometimes, he was beaten up.

## Lucky To Stay Alive

George said that he was lucky to stay alive.

The war ended Aug. 14, 1945, after Japan gave up. A month later, George returned to the United States. He was a tall man, but weighed only 85 pounds. He was just 26 years old. Yet his doctor told him that he would probably die young. The doctor also said his teeth would likely fall out.

Today, George still has his teeth. He also has five children. One of them went with him to Japan.

## Japan Very Different Today

The prisoners are called POWs. It stands for prisoners of war. Today, many former POWs are still mad because the Japanese treated them badly.

One of them is Arthur Gruenberg. He is 94 years old. He lives in Washington state. He became a prisoner in 1942. He was sent to work in a mine. The Japanese did not give him healthy food, and he became blind in one eye.

Arthur said Japan is amazing today. The country has changed a great deal since the war.

He said his feelings toward the country have not changed much. He just hopes there are no more wars.
