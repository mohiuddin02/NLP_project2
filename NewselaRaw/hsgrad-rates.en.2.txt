WASHINGTON, D.C. — The latest figures on U.S. high school graduation rates were recently released by the federal government. The news is both good and bad. 

The good news is that the graduation rate has inched up to 82 percent. In addition, the gap between the graduation rates of white and nonwhite students has narrowed.

The bad news is that the increase in the graduation rate was smaller than in the three previous school years. Furthermore, the improvement was limited to only some types of students.

Education officials and others remain concerned that too many students are dropping out of high school without getting a diploma.

## Wide Gap In Graduate Percentages

The latest figures were released by the Education Department, the U.S. government agency in charge of overseeing the nation's schools. They show wide differences in graduation rates according to where students live. Leading the way was Iowa, with a graduation rate of nearly 91 percent. The District of Columbia had the lowest rate: 61 percent.

For the nation overall, the graduation rate for the 2013-14 school year was up almost a percentage point from 81 percent the previous year. The rate was the highest since the department started using a new, uniform measuring system in 2010.

Education Secretary Arne Duncan praised the new numbers as encouraging. The progress is real and powerful, he said.

Duncan said the numbers show solid improvement for African-American and Hispanic students and English language learners. Progress by all three groups outpaced progress among English-speaking white students.

## U.S. Making Progress But There's More To Do

Still, nearly 1 in 5 students are leaving high school without a diploma. "We have a good deal more to do to ensure that every child has access to a quality education," Duncan said.

The latest figures drew concern from groups campaigning for a 90 percent graduation rate by 2020. To reach that goal, the rate needs to increase each year by at least 1.3 percent. The nation met that mark for three school years in a row starting in 2010, but missed it for the 2013-14 school year.

John Bridgeland heads the group Civic Enterprises, which is taking part in the "90 percent" campaign. He called the new figures "a real wake-up call" and "an early warning indicator to the nation."

Bridgeland praised the gains made by English language learners, African-American and Hispanic students, and students with disabilities. However, he said, those gains are "not rapid enough" to meet the goal of a 90 percent national graduation rate.

## Closing The Achievement Gap

The new figures show that African-American and Hispanic students made progress in closing the achievement gap with white students. About 72 percent of African-American students and 76 percent of Hispanic students finished high school in 2013-2014. For white students, the rate was 87 percent.

Vast differences exist from state to state. Nebraska, New Jersey, Wisconsin, Texas, New Hampshire and Indiana were close behind Iowa, all with solid showings in the high 80s.

At the bottom of the list were Nevada and New Mexico, just ahead of the nation's capital.

The graduation rate is calculated by dividing the number of graduates in a given year by the number of students who enrolled four years earlier. In 2008, the U.S. government ordered all states to begin using this method. The new method gives a more accurate count of how many students actually finish high school.
