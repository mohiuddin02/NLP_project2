BALTIMORE, Md. — As the umpire walked onto the field, he gave a gracious wave to the crowd. He may have been joking, or just stuck in his habits — there was no crowd.

For the first time in its long and quirky history, Major League Baseball held a "ghost game" last week. There were no fans in the stadium on Wednesday, April 29, to watch the Baltimore Orioles defeat the Chicago White Sox, 8-2.

## Thousands Of Empty Seats

No one waited in line for a bathroom, basked in the bright 72-degree afternoon, snacked on Maryland crab cakes or booed when the umpire made a bad call.

Of the 45,971 green plastic seats at Camden Yards, only three were occupied — by lonely scouts watching from behind home plate.

In the press box, there was an unusually large group of curious reporters, many of whom were shaking their heads in bewilderment.

"Today's official paid attendance is zero," the press box announcer said.

Baltimore had been torn apart by riots due to anger over the death of Freddie Gray while in police custody. The city is just now calming down, but the league made the decision to hold its first fan-less game over safety concerns.

## Teams Must Play 162 Games

Despite the unrest in the city, the game had to go on thanks in part to Major League Baseball's unforgiving 162-game schedule. Every team must play the same number of games to make sure the standings are fair at the end of the season.

The game moved briskly, lasting just over two hours — which is short, for baseball. The seventh-inning stretch featured a lightning-fast version of "Take Me Out to the Ballgame," but no stretching.

Playing a professional sport with no fans watching brought up some deep questions. If there are no fans, is there even a true game? And if the fans are not needed, why do we watch?

What does home-field advantage really mean? Is it about a familiar dugout, or the emotional need of our wealthy sports heroes to bond with a community?

## Too Dangerous For A Ball Game?

That last question was especially relevant this week in Baltimore. The game was played without fans precisely because it was thought to be too dangerous to allow them inside the gates. The decision provoked intense debate.

Adam LaRoche, first baseman for the White Sox, said the lack of fans had certainly deprived the game of some of its meaning.

"It's a big part of why we come out here and do what we do," he said in an interview in the dugout before the game. "It's a shame that it's come to them not being able to come out and (enjoy) the game."

White Sox pitching coach Don Cooper conceded that "It's weird, it's different."

Still, Cooper said he had thought deeply about this question. For this game, Cooper said, the players would have to find the emotion and drive from inside themselves.

"If a ball goes into the seats and nobody sees it, is it still a home run? You bet it is," said Cooper, a 38-year veteran of the game, who sat in the dugout before the game, chewing tobacco.

## Fans Still Cheer ... From Outside

As manager of the Orioles, Buck Showalter has a voice that matters much more in Baltimore. He said it was not his place to imagine why the city had become unglued.

Showalter said he could not possibly get into the mind of the city's young black men and pretend he understood their experience, but he hoped the team could rally the city, giving people something positive.

"There are some things I don't want to be normal," he said. "I don't. I want us to learn from some stuff that's gone on, from both sides of it."

It was certainly not normal in the ballpark. Showalter said he was careful about the language he used in the dugout because it was so easy to hear it from anywhere in the vast, cavernous stadium.

Peering into the stadium from outside the gates, a smattering of fans provided the only cheers: "O-R-I-O-L-E-S … Let's go, O's!"

## "Bigger Stuff Than Baseball"

The best views were across the street from the park, in the Hilton Hotel tower, where Orioles and White Sox banners hung from the balconies and team staffers handed out free Orioles floppy hats.

"You're taking away from the fans, but I understand there is bigger stuff going on than baseball right now," said Benjamin Fluke, 19, a criminal justice major at the University of Baltimore who watched from outside.

Before the game, ballpark officials played a taped instrumental version of the national anthem and when each Oriole batter walked to the plate, the customary music played. Orioles officials were trying to maintain some of the routine that athletes rely on, but today, the music just made the eerie silence more awkward.

## "It Breaks My Heart"

When the ball flew foul, into the seats, it bounced around with no one fighting over who got to take it home. There are Little League games going on all over the country with more fans in the stands.

As a player slammed a huge home run, the television announcer said "Goodbye!" and his voice carried out into the silence.

The crack of the wooden bat hitting the ball was crisp, but there was no one to celebrate the great catch in right field or the double play that ended the White Sox's second inning.

Lifelong Baltimore resident Richard Messick sat on a post on the sidewalk watching the strange, once-in-a-lifetime spectacle.

"It breaks my heart that it had to come to this," he said, speaking of the riots that had left the city bruised. As for the decision to hold a game in an empty stadium, he said it was an overreaction.
