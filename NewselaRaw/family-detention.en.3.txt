SAN ANTONIO, Texas â€” Thousands of families came to Texas from Central America last summer. They came to America against the law. The American government opened two detention centers for them to stay at. Eventually, the families have a court hearing to see if they can stay in the country.

Now, lawyers say more women with children are being let out until their cases are decided. The women are given ankle-monitoring bracelets instead of paying money, or a bond, to be released. The bracelets let the government keep track of the women.

## More Women And Children Being Released

The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is the government agency in charge of immigration laws. These laws say who can live in the country. An ICE spokesman said the agency would not hold mothers who truly believe they will face trouble from the government in their home countries. To be released, these mothers have to provide an address in the United States where they will stay. They also cannot be a threat to the United States or somebody who might run away.

"This is a decision they should have made a long time ago," said Jonathan Ryan. He runs a group that offers legal help to the people in detention.

Ryan said his volunteers have seen more women and children at the downtown San Antonio bus station. The women and children have been released from two South Texas detention centers.

## Immigrants Trying To Escape Problems

The detention centers were opened last year. Tens of thousands of families had entered Texas illegally. Most of the families were from Central America. They came to escape the problems in their home country.

Earlier this year, government official Jeh Johnson made an important announcement. He said some families would only have to stay in the centers for a short time. These families are seeking asylum. They want to live in the United States because they are afraid. If they return home, the government in their home countries may punish them.

Johnson promised big changes. These included a lower bond amount. There would also be a quicker release for families with believable asylum arguments.

## Release Requires Bond Payment

Juliana Tecu is one of the immigrants who was recently released. She crossed illegally to the United States in late June. Tecu said she spent 17 days at the 2,400-bed center in Dilley, Texas.

Then she was let go on a $4,000 bond.

"If I waited up to a month, maybe they would lower it," she said in Spanish, referring to the bond. "But when? I didn't want to be there."

About a half dozen other mothers with their children at the bus station with Tecu were wearing ankle bracelets. Their jeans barely covered the chunky technology.

## Ankle Bracelets Are Not Always Fair

Linda Brandmiller is a lawyer. She has represented several women held at a detention center in Karnes City, Texas. Brandmiller said ankle-monitoring bracelets are fair in some cases. Still, she said there should be rules for using them.

"Everybody shouldn't need an ankle bracelet," she said. Not everyone will try to run away.

ICE said it looks at each case one by one. Then it will decide if the person needs to wear an ankle bracelet.

The number of women and children at the detention centers is expected to drop in the coming weeks. Still, the centers will remain open for new immigrants. The centers will also be used to hold people who don't meet the rules for asylum.
