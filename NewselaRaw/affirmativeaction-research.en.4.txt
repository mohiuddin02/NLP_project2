The U.S. Supreme Court is our country's highest court. Right now it is studying the case Fisher v. University of Texas. 

Fisher v. University of Texas is a very important case. It has to do with the way schools decide who to admit. 

After high school many students go on to college or university. Colleges and universities can only take some of the students who want to get in. There is simply not enough room for everyone.

## Who Gets Into College?

Fisher v. University of Texas has been going on for awhile. It began when white student Abigail Fisher sued the University of Texas. Fisher said the school decided not to admit her because of her race. She said a black student with worse grades got in instead of her.

Fisher says she was not admitted because of affirmative action. 

Schools that believe in affirmative action look at the race of students when deciding who to accept. They want to accept students from groups that were treated unfairly in the past. Both blacks and Latinos are among such groups. 

## Unfair To White Students?

Fisher says affirmative action should be against the law. She claims it is unfair to whites.

The Supreme Court Justices will decide if affirmative action should still be allowed. There are nine judges on the Supreme Court. Right now, some are for it and some are against it.

Justice Antonin Scalia is against affirmative action. He says it puts black students in schools that are "too fast" for them. His idea is known as the mismatch theory.

## Is The Mismatch Theory True?

Many treat this idea as fact. However, many scientists say it may not be true.

People who support the theory say affirmative action is bad for nonwhite students. They say some students of color are admitted to good colleges even though they have low grades. Such students are not ready for college, they say. They just end up doing badly.

However, students can have low grades and still be smart. Some students just need a bit of help to do better.

Many nonwhite students face problems that white students do not. These can make schoolwork much more difficult.

## Struggles With Stereotypes

Stereotypes are one problem students of color face. A stereotype is a common but wrong idea about a particular group of people. For example, many people believe certain groups are not as smart as others. 

Students from these groups often worry people will think they are unintelligent. Their fear can make it harder for them to learn and do well.

We have given students exercises that lower their fear of being seen as unintelligent. The results are striking. Such students soon start getting better grades. 

## Unfair Treatment For Black Students?

Many black and Latino students also face another problem. They expect to be treated differently than white students. In fact, before college they often are. For example, in some schools black students are punished more harshly than white students. 

Students who notice such differences may expect college teachers to be unfair to them. Such thoughts can make them feel they do not belong in college. In turn, that can make them do less well.

## More Trust Means Better Grades

There are ways to help. We have given black students exercises that build trust in teachers. Students learn that teachers want them to do well. Such exercises have made black students' grades go up quite a bit.

The Supreme Court should uphold affirmative action. It makes colleges fairer. It raises the chances that students of color will get into schools that match their true skills. 

Colleges must also work harder. They must make students of color feel they belong. Only then will such students be able to do their best.
