WASHINGTON —  More than a million drones have been sold in the past few years. The small pilotless planes are also called unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Some are piloted by onboard computers. Others are controlled by a person on the ground with a remote control.

A growing number of the unmanned planes are turning up in the skies near airports and airliners. The risk of a crash is getting higher also.

Drones have been seen near planes, helicopters and airfields. Air officials receive reports each day.

The number of reports have shot up since two years ago. Drone reports were still unusual then.

## They Can Be Trouble

Many of the reports are filed with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) by airline pilots and airport workers. The FAA is in charge of the nation's skies.

The reports show how hard it is for the FAA to control drones. They can cause a crash if they hit a plane or get sucked into a plane's engine. Drones are difficult for air traffic controllers to see on radar. They can be especially hard to see if they are made out of plastic.

The FAA does not allow drones to be used by most businesses. The rules have been ignored. Real estate agents use drones to take overhead pictures of houses for sale. Farmers fly them to check their crops. Rules to let more businesses use drones are being talked about.

"It should not be a matter of luck that keeps an airplane and a drone apart," said Rory Kay. He is a pilot and expert on air safety. "So far we've been lucky."

## Hard To Chase Down

The FAA requires that people flying drones and model aircraft must fly under 400 feet in altitude. They must keep the drone in sight and fly it at least 5 miles away from an airport.

Jim Williams heads the FAA drone office. In March, he caused a stir. He told a group of drone makers that an airplane nearly crashed into a drone over Florida. The pilot reported a camouflage-painted drone at about 2,300 feet. The FAA has not been able to find the drone or the person flying it.

## Some Other Recent Near-Misses

— Pilots flying at 10,000 feet saw a drone less than 500 feet above their plane. It was moving toward an airport in Pennsylvania. The drone was about 5 feet to 6 feet long.

— Air traffic controllers in California received a report from a helicopter pilot. The pilot spotted a camera-equipped drone flying near the giant Hollywood sign in Los Angeles.

— Controllers in Florida received a report from pilots who spotted a drone below their plane. The drone was described as being red and blue. It was not seen on radar.

— Pilots reported spotting a drone up to 1,000 feet away while landing at a South Carolina airport. The drone was described as the size of a large bird.

— A 5-foot-long drone with a camera crashed near Dallas Love Field airport in Texas. Police are looking for the person who was flying it.

## Pay Attention Or Pay A Fine

The FAA plans to teach drone owners about safety. Some people flying drones may have to pay a fine.

Michael Toscano is president of a group in favor of drones. Some people will always misuse drones, he said. They do not understand the safety risks or simply do not care.

A crash would be bad, Toscano said. However, it would not stop people from flying drones, he said.
