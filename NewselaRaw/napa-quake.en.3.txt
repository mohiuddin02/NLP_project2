NAPA, Calif. â€” City officials in Napa had worried that a serious earthquake could wreck the historic Alexandria Square building.

So they required brick buildings like the Alexandria to be retrofitted. Retrofitting buildings to make them stronger involves bolting brick walls to ceilings and floors.

The work was completed years ago on the 104-year-old Alexandria.

Then a magnitude 6.0 earthquake struck Sunday morning. The walls on the top floors crumbled. Bricks, and the mortar used to hold the bricks together, rained down onto the sidewalk and outdoor cafe.

## It Could Have Been Much Worse

Engineers had feared that retrofitting older buildings isn't enough. It still leaves weak spaces between bricks. Whole chunks can fall, sending bricks crashing down.

"We can't keep every single brick in place in many of these older buildings," said Fred Turner. He is an engineer with California's government. Turner says they can only make the damage less.

Many cities have laws to make owners retrofit buildings. The work has saved lives by keeping buildings from crashing to the ground. Turner said the destruction in Napa would have been much worse without retrofitting.

Parts of brick walls can tumble even with retrofitting. The mortar holding the bricks together can give way during the shaking, Turner said. Over time, mortar can break down and grow so weak that bricks can begin to slide.

Turner said testing the mortar should be part of retrofitting brick buildings. Building owners may need to add new mortar.

## Retrofitting Can Be Expensive

Los Angeles passed a law in the 1980s to retrofit brick buildings. When the 1994 Northridge quake hit, most had been strengthened. Even then, some retrofitted buildings were badly damaged. Luckily, no one died inside them.

There are expensive ways to make brick buildings stronger. Concrete or sticky glues can be added to the brick walls and braces can be installed. Most cities don't make owners add these expensive changes.

When the quake struck at 3:20 a.m., part of the Alexandria's third-story collapsed onto the sidewalk below. A restaurant beneath it has outdoor seating. It was lucky the earthquake hadn't struck when it was open, said Mike DeSimoni Jr., the son of the property owner. "We could have lost lots of people."

David Cocke runs an earthquake retrofit company. He examined photos of the building. Cocke said it looked like the mortar between the bricks had been in poor condition.

Napa has pushed to get its historic brick buildings retrofitted. Out of 18 historic buildings, 12 have been strengthened, said Rick Tooker, a city official.

## Tearing A Hole In The Wall

Three buildings are still on the way to getting retrofitted. Brian Silver owns the three buildings. He said he had not been able to afford the $500,000 cost of retrofitting.

His buildings survived the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and a Napa earthquake in 2000 with little damage. The earthquake Sunday tore a hole in the wall of one Silver's buildings. Falling bricks from the building crushed a parked car.

Silver said he now has enough money to strengthen his buildings. "I'm going to do it as quickly as I can."

Vintner's Collective is a wine bar in Napa. Part of the sandstone front of the building crashed to the sidewalk.

Owner Kim Erasmy said the building was retrofitted, but it may not have helped enough. Now, the building may be too unstable for her to go in.

"Everything that was original has crumbled," Erasmy said. "Everything that makes it a historic building is gone."
