ATLANTA — On the morning of Oct. 14, 1964 — 50 years ago this week — the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. was exhausted.

He had just returned to Atlanta and looked so alarming that his wife, Coretta Scott King, took him to the hospital. The doctor there lectured King about eating fried foods, and told him that he was run-down, overweight and suffering from both a severe virus and high blood pressure.

When Coretta called her husband's hospital room that Wednesday morning to tell him he had won the Nobel Peace Prize, King later said he thought he was dreaming.

Ambassador Andrew Young, a civil rights leader and one of King's closest friends, said he didn't even think King knew he had been nominated for the Nobel. "So it was a shock."

Young said that when King's wife called, he said, "All right," and hung up the phone. Then he called her back and asked, "Did you just call me?" She said, "Yes, you won the Nobel Peace Prize."

## A Turning Point For All

King, who was 35, became the second African-American and, at the time, the youngest person to win the Peace Prize. At the time in the American South, it was against the law for black and white people to eat together in public, and black people had to sit in the back of buses. In 1955, he led the Montgomery, Alabama, bus boycott after Rosa Parks, who was black, refused to give up her seat to a white person.

The honor wasn't just a turning point for King and the civil rights movement, but also for Atlanta. It set off a series of events that some say fundamentally changed the city by bringing blacks and whites together for the first time to share a meal in public.

It was a simple act, holding a multiracial banquet in the new Nobel laureate's honor. Yet, it tested the will and even the nerves of those determined to make Atlanta a more just and equal place.

"It was a defining moment in the history of the city, and it should go down in the city's documented memory," said Janice R. Blumberg, the widow of Rabbi Jacob Rothschild, who helped organize the banquet.

## How To Celebrate The Prize

Following the announcement of King's Nobel win, the immediate question became how do you honor the black man who was now the city's most important figure?

In 1964 Atlanta, the races did not mix.

There was talk in the black community about perhaps having a dinner at an Atlanta restaurant where the civil rights leaders would meet and discuss strategy.

"But it was important that he be received by the entire city," Young said.

Rothschild was the influential rabbi of the temple that had been bombed six years earlier by white supremacists — people who thought that whites were superior to Jews and blacks. The rabbi thought the entire city should participate in celebrating King's Nobel Peace Prize.

"He clearly saw that not only was it the right thing to do, but the only thing to do," his wife said. "He was determined that Atlanta would do the right thing."

## No Support From Business Community

Rothschild, along with the mayor and a group of important Atlanta residents, decided to hold a huge banquet at the Dinkler Plaza Hotel downtown.

Two years earlier, the hotel had refused to give a room to the first African-American Nobel Peace Prize winner, Ralph Bunche.

Even after King's dinner had been announced and a date set, nobody was buying tickets. Atlanta's powerful business community had refused go along with the idea of the multiracial dinner.

"Some of them may have still been segregationists," who wanted blacks and white to be separate, said Blumberg, the rabbi's wife. "But things were changing and some of them couldn't see it. They were businessmen and trying to judge what was going to happen to their businesses," she said.

Some members of the business community simply did not like King or the civil rights community.

Young believes that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which was keeping an eye on King, "was poisoning the Atlanta community with calls, threats and lies about him."

## "We Shall Overcome"

On Dec. 16, the banquet organizers sent a letter to Atlanta-based Coca-Cola, asking for the company's help.

According to Young's written account, J. Paul Austin, chairman of Coca-Cola, said: "It is embarrassing for Coca-Cola to be located in a city that refuses to honor its Nobel Prize winner. We are an international business. The Coca-Cola Company does not need Atlanta. You all have to decide whether Atlanta needs the Coca-Cola Company."

Two hours after Coca-Cola's statement, every ticket was sold.

On the night of Jan. 27, 1965, about 1,500 people — black and white — packed the Dinkler's ballroom to greet King.

The evening ended with the entire crowd singing the civil-rights song, "We Shall Overcome."

Today, King's Nobel Prize is in the news again.

King's three surviving children are due in court in December to determine if the 23-karat gold Nobel Prize medal and a Bible their father once owned should be sold. Brothers Martin Luther King III and Dexter King want to sell the items while their sister, Bernice King, is opposed to selling the mementos.
