BATES COUNTY, Mo. — Ever-increasing global competition in job markets and research fields means American schools are being pushed to churn out smarter and better-prepared students.

Some education experts advocate year-round schools, while others push for longer school days. Some schools have even added Saturday classes.

But a growing number of school districts across the country are going in a completely different direction. They're taking Mondays off.

Students go longer from Tuesday through Friday because they still must meet state minimums for classroom hours. And while they don't go to class on Mondays, teachers do, attending staff development sessions, planning lessons and training on technology.

## Some Small Schools Go For Four

The idea is either horrible or innovative, depending on whom you ask. Critics say it adversely affects students' education. Supporters say it makes teachers better.

Officials in these four-day districts make no apologies and insist their students will hold their own against students anywhere.

"Our ACT scores are the best they've been in 10 years, and our teachers love it," said Chris Fine, superintendent of the Lathrop school district in Clinton County, which went to four days in 2010. It was the first district in Missouri to do so after the General Assembly passed legislation a year earlier.

Most of these are small, rural districts, such as Miami R-1, about an hour south of Kansas City. Its one school building, serving all grades, is surrounded by head-high corn this time of year and has so few students the boys play football for another school in a nearby town.

The Missouri law came with the requirement that any district incurring substantial drop-offs in performance must go back to the traditional five days, but no district has had to do that.

When states first agreed to four-day schedules, the reason was to help small districts cut costs, savings that turned out to be minimal. But that's not why Miami switched this year.

## Doing More In Four Than Five

"This is about making teachers better," Superintendent Frank Dahman said.

He is convinced that giving teachers those Mondays revs them up so they can do more with the new four than the old five days.

"Better-prepared teachers means better students, and that's where the rubber meets the road." No one knows for sure how many districts have gone to four-day schedules. The Education Commission of the States estimates the number at several hundred in 17 states — and going up.

Cutting back to four days is a big mistake, said Jennifer Davis, president of the National Center on Time and Learning, a Boston-based group that advocates more classroom time.

"The idea of narrowing the educational structure is absolutely the wrong direction," Davis said. "We're past the time of graduating from high school and getting a middle-class job. Those jobs are gone."

For those in favor, the thinking is that the plan works best in rural areas where child care for those Mondays would be less of a problem, because a parent is at home or a grandparent is nearby.

You don't see the four-day week in large, urban districts, where parents typically work outside the home.

## Child Care Concerns At First

Fine, the Lathrop superintendent, said child care was a major concern at first. But a community survey conducted halfway through the first year showed that more than 70 percent of parents supported the four-day schedule.

Davis, with the National Center, thinks child care is often a socio-economic issue and should be a deal breaker against the four-day week.

"What about the families that can't afford enrichment activities, piano lessons and high-quality child care on those Mondays?" she asked. "What you would end up with in a lot of districts is kids spending those days in unsafe environments."

Dale Dennis, deputy commissioner for the Kansas Department of Education, said that for the 2010-2011 school year, the state had 16 districts going four days a week.

This year, the list includes four more, all in small, rural districts.

Amanda McConnell, who had arrived at the Miami school to pick up her kindergartner, said she likes the idea of teachers having an extra day for planning, and is tired of hearing people complain that kids will be in school less time.

"They're going the same amount of time — just in a better way," she said.

## Two Sisters Debate Four-Day Week

"But what about the kids having to stay longer each day?" asked her sister, Amy Kelly.

"What — 20 minutes?" McConnell said. "I think they can handle that."

"I think young kids were checking out late in the day already," Kelly said. "This is just going to make that worse."

"Twenty minutes, not two hours," McConnell said. "And being off that Monday refreshes kids for the week."

Their mother, Susan Kelly, broke the tie: "I would have to think more days means better retention."

Superintendent Dahman wants it known that by starting school a week earlier, students will be in class only 14 fewer hours over a school year. But having teachers come in every other Monday is worth 14 hours, because it gives teachers time to catch up, like on technology, especially older ones.

"Give me this time because I need it," said fifth-grade teacher Jeanne Burgin. "I can use an iPad, but my students use it better than me. I have a family and my own kids. I don't want to be in here at midnight or weekends learning to use this thing."

## Mondays For Work Or Homework

Students seem to be good with the change.

"I've got a job after school, and now I can use Monday to put in a good 10-hour day," senior David Weaver said.

Ashley Jellison, a senior volleyball player, said that because of Friday night games, athletes can't do homework that day.

"Now we have Mondays for that," she said.

Dylan Good was one student who disagreed.

"I think it's a waste of a day. We should be in school, and I think my parents would agree with me."
