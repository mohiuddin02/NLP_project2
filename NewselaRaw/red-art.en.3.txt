LONDON â€” Hoping to sell a piece of art for a fortune? These days, it might help if it's red.

That's just one change in the art market. Buyers from countries such as China have become important. They are molding tastes and driving top-end prices ever higher. This has helped the art market to come roaring back from the lows of a few years ago.

Demand for works by modern masters like [Picasso](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Picasso) and Matisse seems bottomless. London's leading art sellers Sotheby's and Christie's are both holding auctions of modern works next week. The highest bidder at the auctions goes home with the art. Sales are expected to be brisk and amount to at least $650 million.

Sotheby's put its pieces on view this Thursday in London. There was quite a bit of red visible, especially in the most highly valued works.

## The Red "Wall"

Take, for example, Gerhard Richter's "Wall." This red painting is expected to sell for at least $20 million. Andy Warhol's red picture of former Chinese leader Chairman Mao is valued at $7 million to 9 million. And a bright red piece by Alberto Burri could go for more than $4 million. That would break the record price for works by the Italian artist.

"We're aware of the power of red," said Alex Branczik of Sotheby's.

"Red is a color that incites passion. It's the color of the sunset, it's the color of blood," Branczik said. It's appealing to people everywhere, he said, but particularly so for Asian buyers. For them, red is associated with luck and happiness.

There is some evidence to support this theory: four of the five most expensive Richters ever sold are red. Sotheby's says there's a chance "Wall" could beat the $37.1 million record for a living painter.

Asian buyers are one reason the art market has rebounded. Buyers from China have led the way.

Chinese collectors began by buying works from their own country. Then they moved to buying European and American art.

China accounted for $14 billion of the $58 billion in art sold globally in 2012. And Asians aren't just buying historical pieces. They're snapping up modern art. In 2013, they spent twice as much on it as they did the year before.

## Global Buyers Step Up

Art spending by Latin Americans also leapt last year. Russian and Middle Eastern collectors continue to pay record prices.

"When I started in this industry, it was really European and American (buyers)," said Jay Vincze of Christie's. "Now it is truly global."

He added, "The buyers are out there ... the market is strong."

All this has raised hopes that 2014 will be a good year in the global art market.

In auctions starting Feb. 4, Christie's will be offering Pablo Picasso's "Woman in a Turkish Costume." This is expected to sell for up to $27 million. Christie's will also offer Juan Gris' "Still Life with Checked Tablecloth," valued at up to $24 million.

Multimillion-dollar works by a range of other famous artists will also be up for sale. These include Piet Mondrian, Rene Magritte, Fernand Leger and Joan Miro.

"When you look around these rooms, the supply we've got this season is incredibly rich and varied," Vincze said Thursday. "The quality is very, very high."

## Wooing The Next Wave

A few blocks away at Sotheby's, sales that start Feb. 5 include Vincent Van Gogh's "Man is at Sea," Lucian Freud's "Head on a Green Sofa," and works by Claude Monet, Marc Chagall and Henri Matisse.

Another highlight is Camille Pissarro's 1897 "Boulevard Monmartre." Sotheby's calls it "one of the most important Impressionist paintings we've handled." It's expected to sell for $9 million to $14 million. But there's a feeling it could bring even more.

It's a far cry from the shaky years after the 2008 banking crisis. Back then, many works sold for lower prices or not at all.

Auctioneers are already looking to woo the next wave of rich art buyers. Christie's held its first sale in India last month. And Sotheby's is opening an exhibition in New Delhi on Friday.

And, said Branczik, "I think Central Asia is interesting. It's a place where a lot of wealth is being generated."
