PESHAWAR, Pakistan â€” In Pakistan's northern tribal areas, the Pakistani army has been waging a yearlong battle against armed militants. The effort has shown unmistakable results in one area, international experts say: the fight against polio.

This year, there have been six reported cases of polio in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan. There were 56 in the same period last year.

In October, 250,000 children could not be reached by vaccination teams. By May, the number was down to 47,0000.

## Health Workers Take Risks To Vaccinate

Northwest Pakistan, on the border with Afghanistan, is a rugged, mountainous area. The tribes that live there face challenges from the Taliban, a violent extremist group fighting the government for control of the country.

The Pakistani Taliban is against efforts to bring polio vaccines to the tribal areas. They claim that the medical teams are actually Western spies looking to gather information in the remote region.

In past years, Taliban militants have routinely attacked health workers and their security teams, killing dozens.

Today, many credit the army's yearlong battle against the Taliban with improving security in the tribal areas. Before starting the offensive last June, the Pakistani army warned people in the area, allowing residents as well as militants time to flee.

People are now returning to towns and villages made safe by army operations. Vaccination teams have resumed their work. They are finding greater access to areas once seen as off-limits.

"Pakistan has done remarkably well this year because the areas are now being cleared of militants and accessibility has become easier," said Aziz Memon, chairman of Rotary International's PolioPlus program in Pakistan.

"There are areas that are still not within reach, where fighting is going on, where we hope to get to sooner or later," Memon said. "But the quality of the campaign has improved."

## There Is Almost No Polio In The World

The Independent Monitoring Board tracks progress in the Global Polio Eradication Initiative: the effort to eliminate polio once and for all. The Board has sharply criticized Pakistan in the past. But in a May report, it noted "a positive difference," in anti-polio efforts.

Pakistan is one of only three countries where polio remains endemic or regularly found. The other two are Nigeria and Afghanistan. Twenty-three out of the 24 polio cases reported this year have been in Pakistan, according to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.

Polio is a viral disease that mainly affects children. It can be serious, causing paralysis, often of the legs, or death.

In the early 1900s, polio paralyzed hundreds of thousands of children every year. Effective vaccines were introduced in the 1950s. Today, polio has been all but eliminated.

## So Close To Being Disease Free

Most of Pakistan is free of the disease, but it has been difficult to wipe out in several pockets of the country. These include the tribal areas, the neighboring province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the seaside metropolis of Karachi. The tribal areas had more than half of the 307 polio cases Pakistan saw in 2014.

For years, U.S. officials urged the Pakistani military to take stronger action against militants based on its soil. Pakistani army leaders say they have killed hundreds of militants, but the claims are difficult to verify.

The Pakistani army's offensive focused on the North Waziristan tribal area, which is home to several armed militant groups. One group of Pakistani Taliban is led by Hafiz Gul Bahadur, who banned the polio vaccine in June 2012. He said he would only allow it if the United States stopped drone strikes. Unmanned drone airplanes are used by the U.S. government to drop bombs on specific targets.

More than 1 million Pakistanis fled their homes in North Waziristan and other militant-controlled areas due to the fighting. Many went to displacement camps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa where they lived temporarily. For the first time, health workers could reach families that had been inaccessible.

As a result, 86 percent of the tribal areas are now covered by the vaccine, up from 47 percent, health officials say.

## Reaching Trouble Spots

Still, some areas remain out of reach. The Khyber Agency tribal area, near Peshawar, has emerged as a new trouble spot. Five of the six polio cases in the tribal region this year were there. Two areas, Bara and Jamrud, remain extremely difficult for health workers to reach.

"Our workers have been attacked in Bara and Jamrud, and they do not feel safe," said a health official in the tribal region who asked to remain anonymous to avoid possible retaliation.

Dr. Naseer Hussain Shah, health director for the tribal areas, said that teams were slowly beginning to visit those areas. He said workers can now visit people door-to-door, offering oral vaccines, in nearly all of the tribal areas.

Serious challenges remain, according to international officials. Many militants have moved from the tribal areas to Karachi, the largest city in Pakistan.

This internal migration has increased fear that the virus could spread through the city of more than 20 million and on to other parts of Pakistan.
