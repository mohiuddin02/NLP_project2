ST. LOUIS — The McCluer Pommies huddled in the corner of the gym as the game clock ticked down to halftime. The girls' arms were linked and their hands clutched their shiny silver and black pom-poms.

"Remember your stuff," high school senior Sierra McKenzie told her team. "You all know what to do."

The McCluer Pommies take their job of spreading spirit at the high school and in the community seriously. The team of 12 is from McCluer High School in suburban Florissant, Missouri, near Ferguson where an unarmed African-American teenager was killed by a white police officer over the summer.

It hasn't been so easy for the Pommies this year. Practices were canceled because of protests after Michael Brown's death in Ferguson. The team lost some funding and the unrest has hurt their fundraising.

Team members brush it off, like they do their nerves right before a performance. The music starts, and their smiles widen, matching the energy in their moves. Once they start dancing, everything else is blocked out.

## A Team To Watch Out For

And in the midst of the challenges, there have been victories.

The team has had strong showings in recent years, including first place in two categories at a recent competition against 40 area teams.

"That's a team to watch out for — that's the reputation we want," said longtime coach Rega Wesley-Stewart. "We just keep pushing."

The Pommies' roots go back more than 50 years at McCluer High School in the Ferguson-Florissant School District.

Unlike powerhouse dance competition teams, most of the McCluer Pommies have never had any formal training.

"In many ways, we start from scratch every year," said Wesley-Stewart, who also is a math teacher at McCluer.

## Being A Pommie Isn't Cheap

The girls have to try out to earn a spot on the team, as well as go through interviews and parent meetings. The cost of being a Pommie is not cheap. The district pays for the coaches and transportation for the team. But the Pommies have to pay for their uniforms, summer dance camp, even their pom-poms. A new Pommie this year paid nearly $1,000.

Students say being a Pommie is an honor and a lot of work. The Pommies' other coach, Jackie Allen, stresses that the girls must have a commitment to both the team and their studies.

"A McCluer Pommie shall provide a spirit-promoting service, be loyal, have high morals and standards, be a good example in and out of school, and develop self-discipline and confidence," reads the team's website.

That mission is important, Wesley-Stewart said, especially in light of the unrest in Ferguson. In November, the grand jury investigating Brown's death decided that there would be no charges against Darren Wilson, who was a Ferguson police officer when he shot and killed Brown. After the decision, more protests broke out, some of them violent.

"There are good kids out there and good parents," Wesley-Stewart said.

## Pizza Sales And Trivia

The protests following the grand jury decision made it difficult for the Pommies to raise money.

A planned trivia night in December had to be canceled. The girls said they had trouble selling tickets. People said they didn't feel comfortable being in the area at night because of the violence.

The girls have sold pizza, cups and spirit wear. The team is trying other ideas, such as selling ads on its website. It also recently started an account with Go Fund Me, a crowd-funding website.

"A lot of people don't have the money," said Victoria Mantia, a high school junior.

In December, the team earned some of the top spots at the Yvonne Cole Dance Team Competition at Lindbergh High School in St. Louis.

It came after major flare-ups of unrest in the Ferguson-Florissant area that canceled school for the district as well as after-school activities and practices.

After the grand jury announcement in November, practices were missed less than two weeks before a major competition.

## "Doing Something Good"

In the crowd watching the Pommies at a recent basketball game was 2011 McCluer graduate and former Pommie Aaries Wadsworth. She came to see the team and her former coaches before heading back to the University of Missouri-Kansas City.

"This was everything for me in high school," Wadsworth said. "These are a bunch of really intelligent woman doing something good for themselves and the school."

Wesley-Stewart said she wants to see the team eventually participate in a national dance competition. In February, they will dance in the state competition in St. Charles, Missouri.

The girls say they grow each year in their work ethic and confidence. Some said Wesley-Stewart helped them get their grades up, while others said the experience will stay with them after high school.

Jerianna Harden, a senior, remembers seeing the Pommies perform for the first time when she was a freshman.

"I've got to try out," she remembers thinking. Looking at the cost, which added up to few hundred dollars, her mom Tamie, a single parent, remembers thinking she had to find a way to make it work.

"I just want it to keep going," Harden said.
