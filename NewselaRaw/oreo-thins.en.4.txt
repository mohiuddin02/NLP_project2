Oreos are the world's top cookie. The Mondelez company makes them.

The company is trying something new. They have come up with a new kind of cookie. It is just like an Oreo, but it is very skinny. The cookies are called Oreo Thins.

The new Oreos are about half as thick as the old kind. You can stack them like pancakes. Two Oreo Thins are about as tall as one Oreo.

Oreo Thins are a bit fancy. Mondelez thinks grown-ups will like them. They are not made for twisting apart to lick the cream inside.

## We Love Our Oreos!

Oreos have been around for a long time. The first ones were made in 1912.

Many people know about Oreos. Most have tried an Oreo. People really like them. Oreos are very popular all over the world.

Oreos can be eaten plain or dipped in milk. They can make other foods tasty.

Oreos can be mixed into ice cream and milkshakes. Smashed Oreos can be used for pie crust. They can be sprinkled as a topping. Some people even fry Oreos.

## What's That New Cookie?

Oreos are very old-fashioned. Sometimes the cookie company tries new things. They mix up the flavors.

One day, Mondelez tried making an Oreo without any chocolate. It was called a Golden Oreo. The cookie part was vanilla. It still had cream in the middle.

Golden Oreos were a big hit. People told Mondelez they should keep making them. Golden Oreos are still very popular today.

Sometimes Mondelez puts a new flavor in the cookie's filling. One kind of tastes like watermelon. The cream is red and green. They are only sold for a short time.

## More Cookies, Please!

Americans buy more Oreos than any other cookie. Keebler is in second place. Oreo sells about twice as many cookies as Keebler does. <img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/OREOS142.png" />

Americans are not the only ones who love Oreos. People enjoy them all over the world. They eat many more Oreos than any other cookie.

Oreo Thins were sold in China last year. Many people bought them. Now Oreo Thins are coming to the United States. Then they will be in other countries.
