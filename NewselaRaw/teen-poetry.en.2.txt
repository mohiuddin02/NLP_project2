On a sunny afternoon, the words pour out of 19-year-old Celestelle Webster and 18-year-old Christelle Roach. The feelings they express are both fierce and startling.

"The bones in my body are like needles in my skin … I am a bomb, take shelter."

The two are in a small auditorium at the Miami Beach Regional Library. Facing each other onstage, they summon a wrenching vision with lines they wrote together.

"Why are you still here? I'm in love with the arsonist … There is a fire burning inside me."

Webster and Roach are members of WordSpeak, a teenage spoken-word poetry program run by Miami's Tigertail Productions. Today's performance is a practice run. In July, their program will send them and five others to a national poetry contest.

## Poetry Can Be Commanding

Now in its ninth year, WordSpeak teaches young people the craft of poetry. At the same time, it gives them a powerful sense of purpose, empowerment and responsibility.

Key to that process is WordSpeak coach Teo Castellanos. Before becoming an award-winning theater writer, director and teacher, Castellanos grew up around drugs and gangs in Florida. This kind of past helps him to communicate easily with kids from a similar background. Castellanos shifts easily between street slang and a careful examination of poetic language, rhythm, performance and meaning.

The team will need to be at the top of its game when it arrives at the Brave New Voices contest in Philadelphia this month. It will be competing with 500 other teens from across the United States and other countries.

At the recent practice session, Castellanos urged Roach and Webster not to forget "your intentions, your goals, your rhythms … You'll find the chaos — it's the hardest rhythm for most people."

Next up are Wesly Oviedo, Steffon Dixon and Al Alexandre. Their poem is on shootings and Florida's gun laws. The boys, who are African-American and Afro-Caribbean, take the subject personally, saying heatedly: "I feel like Florida is the gunshine state and I'm living in the bottom of the barrel."

Castellanos says he's pleased — but pushes for improvement. He suggests they start with a feeling of celebration so the shift to describing the murders will be more startling.

"Don't fear going overboard," he tells them. "The farther you go, the more dramatic the shift — it's gonna be crazy!"

## Confidence Is Empowering

The seven members of the team were selected from a group of around 1,000 WordSpeak members. Each had won smaller poetry slams, or contests, held to choose the national team.

Tigertail head Mary Luft says the goal of WordSpeak is not just to sharpen writing and speaking skills. The program also serves to give teens more confidence.

After one year in the program, Luft says, the teens are changed dramatically. "How they speak, how they present themselves" is very different. "They are empowered."

She added, "It's an opportunity for a young person to find a door to their life. They start thinking differently about their place in the greater world and what else is out there."

Maylin Enamorado started performing her poetry when she was in ninth grade. At first she was afraid of getting onstage, and she was shocked when she was chosen for the WordSpeak team the following year.

But when they arrived in San Franciso for the contest, she was excited to be around hundreds of other kids who love poetry.

"For the first time, I was like, poetry is normal!" Enamorado says. "I felt completely at home — and the creativity, the subjects were eye-opening."

Instead of going to college, Enamorado, who graduated from high school this year, will head off to teach in Africa in August.

"I don't think I would have had the courage to go to Africa without WordSpeak," she says. "The program has made me feel strongly about bringing about change — we try to make a difference."

## Doors And Books Open Up

Castellanos says many of the kids are unusually independent.

But in a world that idolizes sports and pop music, even the most independent teenager can use the support of teachers and friends who share their love for poetry and language. Roach says she's the only artist in a family focused on sports and business. She is "the pen in the box of pencils" who wrote poetry at her brother's basketball games.

This is Roach's second year with the WordSpeak team.

"Everyone has such vast knowledge — I feel like I have so many books open to me," says Roach. "I've changed in that I know how to say what I'm feeling."
