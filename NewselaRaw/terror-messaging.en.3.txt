WASHINGTON â€” A terrorism group has discovered a disturbing new way to talk to its followers and get new ones.

The group is using instant-messaging apps that encode texts or destroy them. Some of the apps put the messages into secret code so no else can read them. Other apps just erase the messages.

The problem is that law enforcement officials cannot read the messages. The phone companies and the app developers say they cannot unlock the codes. They also say they do not keep a record of the messages.

Michael B. Steinbach is the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) top official for fighting terrorism. The FBI is a government department, and one of its jobs is to prevent attacks in the United States. He said the FBI is completely unaware of what these messages say.

FBI officials now want Congress to allow it to get into messaging apps, as well as apps that destroy texts. Hundreds of millions of people use these apps because they do not want anyone to know who they are. Fighters from the Islamic State group are doing the same thing.

Islamic State is a violent group. It wants to start its own country under Islamic law. Its fighters have taken over parts of Syria and Iraq in the Middle East.

## Violent Leaders Find Followers On Facebook

The FBI thinks that 200,000 people around the world see messages each day from the Islamic State group.

The group tries to get followers by looking at Twitter, Facebook and other sites to see who is re-posting their message. They then invite them to text directly. FBI agents fear they will miss important clues because they cannot see the messages.

Lately, the Islamic State group has been using these kinds of apps more and more.

The government is keeping the details secret. Officials do not want extremists to know the government cannot read its messages.

The government has asked social media companies for the information. The companies are not cooperating.

## Companies Say Messages Should Stay Private

Tim Cook is the head of Apple. Last week he defended his company's decision to make FaceTime and iMessage completely private.

Cook said people have many good reasons to use the apps privately. Letting the FBI read iMessages harms freedom of speech, he said.

In Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, lawmaker Michael McCaul of Texas gave a warning. He said extremists use the apps to avoid getting caught. He said these tricks are completely new. The United States must change its way of thinking if it wants to stop terrorism.

Steinbach wants social media companies to make the information available if a court orders it.

Public interest for these kinds of apps is growing.

Kik, one of the app companies, is based in Canada. It says it has more than 200 million users in 230 countries, including 40 percent of American youths. Kik's website states that the text of Kik conversations is stored only on the phones of Kik users. Kik does not see or store chat message texts. It also cannot get the information off someone's phone.

## Social Media Helps Catch Some Suspects

Terrorism suspects have been found using social media sites.

Since last summer, the FBI has arrested nearly 40 people. The people were suspected of seeking to join terrorist groups or help them.

Most of them had a connection to social media, John Carlin said. He is a national security official.

Not long ago, the Air Force destroyed an Islamic State command center in Syria. Experts found it after a fighter talked about its location online.

Last fall, Islamic State leaders gave an order. The group made a rule that stops fighters from taking pictures of attacks and places without permission. The group also gave a guide to its fighters. The guide tells fighters how to get rid information that shows others where the photos are taken.
