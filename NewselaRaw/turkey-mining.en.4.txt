SOMA, Turkeyâ€” At a graveyard, women wailed loudly. They swayed and sang about the men they loved who died in Turkey's worst mining disaster.

Near them were row upon row of new graves.

Pictures of the lost relatives were pinned onto their clothing. "The love of my life is gone," some sang. They chanted the names of dead miners.

At least 283 people died in the mining accident. Another 141 miners are still missing. Tuesday's disaster has set off protests around Turkey. Many of them are aimed at Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. He is the head of Turkey's government. Blackening Erdogan's reputation even more, one of his assistants was accused of kicking a protester.

## Erdogan's Car Attacked

In Soma, many people work at the coal mines. Many mourners said they spent their whole lives fearing something like this would happen.

"The wives of the miners kiss their husbands in the morning. When they come back, even if they are five minutes late, everyone starts calling. You never know what is going to happen," said Gulizar Donmez. She is the daughter and wife of miners and the neighbor of one of the victims.

Erdogan was not welcome during a visit to the area Wednesday. Hundreds of people attacked his car. He was forced to hide in a supermarket. Angry crowds called him a murderer and a thief.

The prime minister seemed to ignore people's grief. He called the mining accidents "ordinary things." He said they happened in many other countries. He compared them to mine accidents that happened in the 1800s in Great Britain.

Erdogan wants to become Turkey's president. However, in December, he fired four top officials because they took bribes. He and family members have also been accused of illegally taking money from companies that want to do business with the government. Erdogan denies doing anything wrong. He says people are lying to make him lose the election.

## "A Huge Disaster"

Turkish newspapers on Thursday printed pictures they said were of Erdogan's assistant kicking a protester. The pictures show the protester on the ground. He is being held down by police.

The official in the prime minister's office did not want to talk about it. He said there was a scuffle as Erdogan entered a building. But he denied he had hit the protester.

Abdullah Gul is Turkey's president. He called the mining accident "a huge disaster."

He said, "The pain is felt by us all." During a visit to Soma, local residents shouted insults at him. They demanded that more should be done to find the trapped miners.

Around Turkey, people are protesting the deaths. They are also protesting poor safety conditions at mines around the country. Many Turkish workers stopped work to demand better conditions in the mines.

In two cities, police used force to break up the protests.

## Search Slowed By Fire

Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said the search for miners has slowed down. A fire inside the mine made it too dangerous for rescue teams to enter. But the fire has shrunk. Yildiz said that if, God willing, workers can put out the fire, they will be able to find the miners faster.

Tuesday's disaster was caused by an explosion at a power unit.

The government has said 787 people were inside the coal mine at the time. A total of 383 miners were rescued. Many of them were injured.

The death toll made it Turkey's worst mining accident.

Mining accidents are common in Turkey. Turkish mines have poor safety conditions. Erdogan promised that the Soma mining disaster would be looked into thoroughly.

The mine had been inspected five times since 2012. The most recent inspection was in March. No safety violations were found then. But there have been several small accidents in mines around Soma. Erdogan's government recently decided not to investigate them.
