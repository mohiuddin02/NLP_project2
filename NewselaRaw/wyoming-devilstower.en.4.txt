Scientists have a different explanation. They say the lines along the sides of Devils Tower are not claw marks from big bears. Instead, the lines are actually the edges of columns of rock from a long-ago volcano. The columns formed as the lava cooled and shrank, cracking apart.

## Many Theories

How did Devils Tower in Wyoming form? Did it form below ground or as part of a violent volcanic eruption?

Scientists have many theories. Devils Tower is a butte, which is a lonely hill with steep sides and a flat top. It stands nearly 1,300 feet tall today. Devils Tower was created 49 million years ago. Some scientists think that lava was squeezed to the surface between underground layers of rock. Others say the lava came from an underground volcano.

Prokop Závada is a geologist in Eastern Europe. Geologists study rocks and how the Earth was formed. He and other geologists became interested in the mystery of Devils Tower. They found a clue in another butte. It is located in the Czech Republic, his country. The Czech butte is similar to Devils Tower, although it is more rounded and covered with trees.

## How The Lava Flowed

The researchers think that the Czech butte was formed by a type of volcano. It is called a maar-diatreme. This type of volcano blasts a crater into the Earth's surface. After the blast, lava filled the crater, acting like a plug. Wind and rain chipped away at the edges of the lava plug. Eventually only its core remained. The two buttes are very much alike. The Czech team decided to see they were formed in the same way.

They also studied the position of minerals within the columns of rock in the side of the butte.

The government's National Park Service is in charge of Devils Tower. The service allowed the researchers to collect one rock from Devils Tower to test.

The scientists discovered that near the rock's base, tiny needle-shaped minerals are straight up and down. That makes sense. The lava flowed upward before it hardened. Closer to the top, the tiny needle-shaped minerals turn on their sides.

## Models Of Volcanoes

Next, the researchers made models of volcano explosions. They mixed tiny minerals into soft plaster. They squeezed the material upward through a cone full of earth and rock.

When the plaster hardened, the researchers cut the cone open. They examined the inside. They measured which way the minerals faced just as they had done at Devils Tower.

The columns of Devils Tower matched the pattern exactly. Závada and his team made an important discovery. They realized an underground volcano also caused Devils Tower.

## Other Answers? Maybe

Bernard Housen is with Western Washington University. He was not involved in the study. He said the study made sense. Yet, there can be other answers. He said the government let scientists take too few rock samples to know for sure. The governments wants to make sure the rock formation is saved. Yet, that means scientists cannot get more samples to study from Devils Tower.

Scientists might be able to study other buttes near Devils Tower. They were likely formed in the same way — without the help of giant bears.
