KERDASA, Egypt â€”  Three months ago, the Archangel Michael Christian church was looted and burned by hundreds of people. Rida Gaballah, 49, was one of six people who tried protect his place of worship from attack. Later, he stood among the ruins of the building.

Utterly dismayed by the missing pews, the charred paintings of Jesus and the cross ripped off from the front door, he simply kept repeating: "This scene is horrible."

The Egyptian government vowed to rebuild the church, one of 74 destroyed since the army removed President Mohammed Morsi from power on July 3. But work has yet to begin here. The church remains as a monument to the violence brought by Morsi's supporters. It also shows the government's failure to protect historic Egyptian institutions.

But Gaballah, like other Christians, is slow to criticize. "Of course they are doing enough," Gaballah said when asked about the government's efforts, even as the scene around him proved otherwise.

## Attacks On Churches Continue

The wave of attacks on churches sparked outrage in the weeks immediately after Morsi was forced out of office. Now, for both Christian and Muslim alike, that anger has been replaced by complete silence. Yet the attacks continue across the country.

The 74 best-documented cases of attacks on churches came between June 30 and Sept. 30, but there have been others since. No one yet knows how many attacks have happened recently.

Christians make up an estimated 10 percent of Egypt's 92 million population. But they have never had an easy time in the country, often caught between a strictly non-religious government and sometimes hostile Islamists who want to return to a strictly Muslim state.

Christians have never found Egyptian governments to be friendly toward them. In 1934, the country's rulers imposed 10 conditions on Christians who wanted to build a church. They included that Muslims had to approve construction of a church, and churches could not face the Nile River. No church was allowed to be built within 340 feet of a mosque.

Egyptian governments have also done little to protect Christians from the occasional violence by Muslims. No one has ever been convicted in Egypt for destroying Christian churches, going back to 1972, when the first one was burned. There has been, at best, a single arrest in the most recent church burnings.

Yet Christians don't want to criticize the militarily imposed new government. They don't want to annoy the latest rulers, who have not used anti-Christian language like Morsi used to do.

## Christians Consider Military Rule Better

Morsi was an Islamist and associated with the secretive Muslim Brotherhood organization that is now banned in Egypt.

Many of the recent attacks on Christians were triggered by Islamist clerics preaching that Christians caused Morsi's downfall.

When Morsi was president, violence against Christians was rare. But Christians in Egypt now think that a military government is better for them than a democracy dominated by Islamists.

 Ishak Ibrahim is a Christian who works for a civil rights group in Egypt. He believes that Christians prefer to live under government based on force than a democracy that is ruled by Islamists. "The choice before people is freedom or the right to live," Ibrahim said.

Egyptian Christians fear that pushing back against the government could lead to something they believe is worse, the return of the Islamists.

Youssef Sidhom is the editor-in-chief of Watani, Egypt's biggest Christian newspaper, which his father started. Sidhom said that Christians and Muslims were united together against "the horrible damage inflicted by the Muslim Brotherhood and Morsi." But he now believes that the Christians are "terrified to speak."

So there is little pressure on the government to do more for Christians. The police say they don't have enough forces to protect 2,000 Christian churches in Egypt, especially as their own police stations have also been attacked.

## Police Looking Elsewhere For Now

A police colonel said there will be no special efforts to go after those who destroyed the churches. They also don't have plans to question residents in the small villages who might know who was involved in the fires.

The colonel claimed that protecting churches is not the police's responsiblity. He believes there are bigger battles to be fought instead. The officers first want to find out who destroyed their police stations and lock up members of the banned Muslim Brotherhood.

"Our job is not to protect churches," the colonel said, speaking in secret. The officer said they have arrested some people but that the villagers won't talk about who burned the churches because they are scared.

Other people believe the police have their own reasons for the lack of protection. Every attack on Christians gives the government more reasons to chase after their political enemies, all with the public's approval.

Ahmed Ragab is a legal researcher who studied of the destruction of churches. He said that when churches are burned, the government can blame the Muslim Brotherhood and win support for their crackdown on the Islamists.

Pope Tawadros II, who is the leader of Egypt's Christian church, made a statement a few days after Archangel Michael Church was destroyed. He called for national unity and for Christians to stand with the government.

"If the hands of evil kill, destroy and torch, then God's hands are greater and they build," Tawadros said. "Christ's commandments to us are love your enemy, bless those who curse you, and do good to those who abuse you."
