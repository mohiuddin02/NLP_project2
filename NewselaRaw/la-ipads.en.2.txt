LOS ANGELES â€” As school districts across the country are moving classwork online, many of them are providing each student with a computer.

The idea is to try to replace school books with online lessons and give all students access to technology. The computers should also help keep students engaged in learning.

But these upgrades come at a high price. So, many school districts are trying to figure out the best way to spend their money on personal computers and tablets for students.

"It's a huge, huge marketplace that is only going to grow," said Brian Lewis. He runs the International Society for Technology in Education in Washington, D.C. The organization focuses on the use of technology in schools.

"Everyone is trying to figure out the best solution in the constantly changing" tech field, he said.

## "The Best We Can Afford"

At a cost of $1 billion, the Los Angeles Unified School District has one of the nation's most expensive technology programs. This is despite the fact that California spends less per student for education than most states. The district is paying $768 for higher-end iPads loaded with new math and English software for every teacher, student and administrator.

The district is borrowing money to pay for the iPads. This is something that other school systems are unable or unwilling to do.

LA schools Superintendent John Deasy said it was important to buy computers with lessons that follow learning standards recently adopted by California and 44 other states. He also wanted students to be able to take tests on them.

"Our youth deserve the best we can afford," Deasy said.

Other school districts have found cheaper ways to provide the latest technology to students. Many buy or rent cheaper computers. They may give students in grade school a less expensive computer than high schoolers.

"The iPad is the gold standard," said Jay McPhail, a Riverside Unified School District administrator. "Our problem is we don't have any gold."

Riverside Unified in California has purchased about 28,000 devices, including the Kindle Fire and iPad Mini. They cost as little as $150 each. The district figures out which device is best for which school. The district provides computers for students who don't have their own.

## Education Apps For iPads

Nearby Perris Union High School District pays $344 for a Chromebook for every student. The Chromebook is a laptop-style device with a larger screen and keyboard. It can connect to thumb drives, printers, cameras or CD players. These features are useful for doing research online and writing papers, said Superintendent Jonathan Greenberg.

"We didn't pick Chromebooks and try to make it work," Greenberg said. "The device was picked after we decided what is it we need to do."

Among the many districts choosing tablets, the vast majority have gone with iPads. There are many education apps for it. Also, schools feel that iPads won't break as easily.

Township High School District 214 in Illinois is paying $429 per iPad 2. The tablets don't include educational software. This is because the district didn't want to make every teacher use the same lessons.

"What we've seen is that there isn't one piece of (software) that fits the needs of every teacher," said Keith Bockwoldt, director of technology services at the Illinois district.

## Tech-Based Lessons

School officials in Huntsville, Ala., were concerned that Apples were too expensive. And the Chromebook, part of a Google system, could be a problem for students who don't have Internet at home.

Huntsville is renting HP laptops with their large screens for $750 apiece over three years. District officials said they believe the laptops will be much less expensive over time.

Huntsville is beginning to replace textbooks and put all the materials online.

Another way to save money is to buy tablets and computers without educational software. It was the educational software that made the iPads at L.A. Unified so expensive. The math and English software added as much as $200 per device.

Instructors in Perris and Riverside in California typically use online lessons and programs, many of them free. That allows students to use their own computers or tablets, if they own them. In Riverside, that has saved the district a lot of money.

Teams of Perris educators also have developed their own tech-based lessons. And that is an important point, said Greenberg, the Perris superintendent. These lessons may be delivered on a different kind of computer in the future.

"The device itself is a short-term thing," he said. "New devices are always coming out."
