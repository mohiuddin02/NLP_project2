CHICAGO â€” Low-income teens don't just get better grades by attending top-notch high schools. Good schools may also help them to be healthier, a new study suggests.

Researchers found that kids who went to the best schools were more likely to make healthier choices.

The researchers looked at 1,000 students in grades 10 through 12. Other than their schools, the teens were similar in many ways. Most of them were Latinos from low-income neighborhoods in Los Angeles.

The researchers compared the behaviors of students who attended high-performing schools and low-performing schools. Overall, 36 percent of the kids in the good schools took part in at least one of 11 risky behaviors. These included drinking large amounts of alcohol, having unsafe sex and using illegal drugs. In comparison, 42 percent of the teens who attended worse schools engaged in more risky behaviors.

## What Does The Study Prove?

The study doesn't prove that the schools made the difference, and the results are not completely reliable. A large number of students refused to participate. Still, lead author Dr. Michael Wong said the results echo other research findings. The study seems to show that "better education will lead to better health," said Wong, a medical doctor and researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles.

The study involved mostly Latino students who applied to one of three top-performing public charter schools in Los Angeles from 2007 to 2010. A charter school is an independently run school that receives government money. About half of the kids had parents who did not graduate from high school. Most of their families didn't own their own homes.

Results were published online Monday in the medical journal Pediatrics.

In the study, teens were given surveys over the computer. They were able to answer the questions in private to improve the chances they would be honest. The California Department of Education provided the academic test scores.

## Study Is Random, But Controlled

Kelli Komro is a professor of  health outcomes and policy at the University of Florida in Gainesville. Although the study isn't perfect, she called it "a beautifully conducted natural experiment." Komro was not involved in the research.

The charter schools select students at random in a lottery system. The students weren't chosen based on their grades or test scores. The study "mimics a randomized controlled trial," Komro said.

In a randomized controlled trial, people are put in different groups. In a study to see if candy causes tooth cavities, for instance, one group would be given candy and another group would not be able to eat candy. Researchers then check to see if there's a difference between the groups. In this case, students with similar backgrounds attended very different types of schools. This gave researchers the chance to study whether the kids at better schools act differently. The randomized controlled trial is considered to be the gold standard of research studies.

## Schools Need To Serve Kids In More Ways

Most of the kids who got into the charter schools attended them. Nearly all the other students went to schools that weren't as good. After one year, the teens who went to the better schools had higher math and English test scores. Moreover, just 9 percent of the kids at the better schools dropped out. At the low-performing schools, almost 25 percent dropped out.

Professor Harold Pollack, a University of Chicago public health researcher, said the study is important. It showed the need to create "a much larger number of schools that serve kids well."

Pollack said that doing well in school is important for their long-term health. Good grades are even more important than avoiding risky behavior.

"Educational outcomes are just so critical for people's well-being," he said.
