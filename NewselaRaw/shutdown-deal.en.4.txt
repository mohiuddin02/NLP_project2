WASHINGTON â€” Congress voted Wednesday to end the government shutdown and increase the amount of money the Treasury can borrow. The shutdown had lasted 16 days.

The vote came just before an important deadline. The United States was expected to reach the current $16.7 trillion debt limit on Thursday. After that, the Treasury could no longer borrow money to pay the country's bills.

The Senate approved the legislation in a bipartisan 81-18 vote. The House vote was 285-144. The bill was sent for President Barack Obama's signature.

"We fought the good fight. We just didn't win," said House Speaker John Boehner. Republicans who wanted to get rid of or shrink the health care law known as Obamacare got nothing in the deal.

## Nation Neared Financial Disaster

The Treasury will be able borrow normally through Feb. 7 or perhaps a month longer. The deal will also pay for the government through Jan. 15. More than 2 million federal workers will be paid under the agreement.

The nation neared "disaster" before the agreement was reached, Harry Reid said. He leads the Senate Democrats.

The measure had support from the White House and most if not all Democrats in Congress. Some Republicans who feared how a default would hurt the country also supported the bill.

"We'll begin reopening our government immediately," Obama said after the Senate vote. "We can begin to lift this cloud of uncertainty from our businesses and the American people."

Lawmakers who side with the tea party triggered the shutdown that began on Oct. 1. They opposed Wednesday's deal.

Sen. Ted Cruz said the measure was "a terrible deal." He criticized fellow Republicans for lining up behind it.

## Republicans Plummet In Polls

Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell negotiated the deal with Reid.

The shutdown and brush with default have sent Republicans' public approval plummeting, polls showed. The party has been badly split nationally.

The Club for Growth favors limited government. It urged lawmakers to vote against the bill.

The bill does not significantly change Obamacare, the group said. It also does not change other government programs that cost "trillions," the group said. "If this bill passes, Congress will kick the can down the road, yet again."

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce came out in favor of the bill. The Chamber represents business interests and usually supports Republicans.

The bill lets the Treasury borrow again. It also had funding for the government to reopen. That was about it.

House and Senate negotiators will meet this fall. They will see if progress is possible on a deal to reduce the amount the government owes.

Other issues fell away in a final deal.

The struggle has occupied essentially all of Congress' time for the past three weeks.

## Bitter Fight Over Obamacare

The shutdown began on Oct. 1. It came after Cruz and his tea party allies in the House demanded money be pulled from the health care law. That was their condition for providing essential government money.

Obama and Reid refused. Then they refused again and again as Boehner gradually scaled back Republican demands.

Initially, about 800,000 government workers were sent home. That soon fell to about 350,000 after Congress agreed to let Pentagon employees return to work. There were many hassles. But the mail was delivered. Medicare continued to pay doctors who treated seniors and there was no interruption in Social Security benefits.

Still, national parks were closed. Also, government research scientists were sent home and Food and Drug Administration inspectors only worked occassionally.

Republican polls sank. Still, Boehner refused to let the House vote on legislation to reopen the entire government. He insisted on trying to reopen only parts. The White House and Reid rejected that approach.

European officials, Cabinet members and bankers in this country warned that failure to raise the debt limit invited an economic disaster. It would be far worse than the near-meltdown of 2008, they said.
