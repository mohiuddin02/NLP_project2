Divers found a chunk of metal in a shipwreck in 1901. It was about the size of a shoe box. It is known now as the Antikythera Mechanism.

Scientists and people who study math are excited about the Antikythera Mechanism. That was not always the case. When it was first found, archaeologists were more interested in other things from the sunken ship. Archaeologists study human history by looking at items from the past.

The old ship was found off the Greek island of Antikythera. The ship had items like life-size statues of warriors and horses.

Scientists know now that the piece of metal was the biggest treasure of all.

## A Series Of Gears

The metal is actually a tool. It is made up of a series of gears. The gears work together. They were designed to show when things would happen in space. Those things include the positions of the sun, moon and planets. It also predicted eclipses, which happen when the moon blocks the light from the sun from reaching Earth.

The tool was built 2,000 years ago. Nobody thought people back then were able to make something like it. Some scholars say it may be the world's first computer.

James Evans said the way the Antikythera Mechanism was made is "amazing." Evans is a scientist and historian. Evans is a member of a group working to figure out when the device was made and why. Evans recently suggested the device came from 205 B.C. If it was created that year, it would mean the tool was 100 years older than people had originally thought.

If Evans is right, then the work of Archimedes could have led to the Antikythera Mechanism. Archimedes is a famous Greek mathematician.

It would also mean the device was built at an important time in scientific history. It was a time when scientific beliefs from many peoples were coming together. Those beliefs were mixing to form a new idea of how the stars and planets worked.

## Writing On The Dials

Scientists think the ship sunk around 60 B.C.

Greek sponge divers found the wreck of the Roman ship in 1900. Divers dug up items from the wreck in 1901.

French explorer Jacques Cousteau visited the site of the wreck in the 1950s and again in the 1970s. Cousteau used an underwater vacuum. It uncovered buried objects.

The real important piece for understanding the device came in 2005. Then, a team of scientists used X-rays. They found the layers of gears inside the crust-covered metal. Other methods led to the first sharp images of the writing on the dials.

The studies revealed at least 30 gears. Researchers believe the device held at least 24 more.

The gears were in a wooden box. It was operated by a hand crank. Dials followed the way stars and planets move.

One dial looked at the four-year cycle of Olympic Games. Another one predicted when eclipses would happen.

## The "Start Date"

The eclipse dial was what Evans and Christian Carman focused on.

Before, archaeologists thought the device was built between 150 and 100 B.C. They were basing their guess on the Greek lettering on the device. But Evans and Carman looked at the eclipse dates on the device. They compared those dates to historical records of when eclipses happened.

They concluded that the "start date" for the eclipse predictor was 205 B.C.

That doesn't prove the device was built then, but Evans thinks it was.

The 205 B.C. date is important. It means the tool was built around the time when a Greek inventor lived. His name was Archimedes. He changed how people thought about geometry. Archimedes was killed seven years before 205 B.C.

There is no way to link Archimedes to the Antikythera Mechanism. Still, Evans said whoever built it at least used knowledge developed by Archimedes.
