Last month, a jury found Dzhokhar Tsarnaev guilty for his role in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. The jury of 12 people listened to all of the witnesses and heard the facts in the case before making its decision.

Last week, it was told to answer another question: What should happen to him?

Before the jury members began deciding, though, a judge reminded them that they had two choices. They could sentence Tsarnaev to spend the rest of his life in prison, or sentence him to be put to death by the government.

This serious choice "is yours, and yours alone, to make," District Judge George A. O'Toole Jr. said.

On Friday, the jury sentenced Tsarnaev to death. It took them 14 hours to decide.

## Jury Considers Two Sets Of Factors

On April 15, 2013, Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, exploded two bombs at the Boston Marathon race, killing three people and injuring more than 250 others.

In April, the jury found Tsarnaev guilty of 30 crimes. To give Tsarnaev the death penalty, the jury members all had to agree. If even one jury member said no to the death penalty, Tsarnaev would have been sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison.

The jury was told to consider two sets of factors. The first set is called aggravating factors. These are anything that makes the crime especially bad and could support a death sentence. The other set is mitigating factors, which would argue for life in prison instead. One bombing victim — 8-year-old Martin Richard — was repeatedly called an aggravating factor because he was so young.

However, after Tsarnaev was found guilty, Martin's parents wrote a letter asking the government to stop seeking the death sentence. They said if Tsarnaev got the death sentence, he would likely try to get a higher court to let him live. This is called an appeal and can take a lot of time. Appeals would keep Tsarnaev in the news and his case in their lives. If Tsarnaev was in prison, they would not have to hear about the case all the time, the parents said.

It is not known if the jury ever learned about the letter.

## Tsarnaev "Didn't Care For A Second"

Lawyers for the government last week retold details about the bombing when they made their arguments to the jury.

Steven Mellin is a government lawyer, known as a prosecutor. He said that Tsarnaev did not value the lives of his victims. Tsarnaev "didn't care for a second what impact his actions and his killings would have on so many other innocent family members and friends," Mellin told the jury. "His actions have earned him a sentence of death."

Tsarnaev's lawyers, meanwhile, always admitted that he took part in the bombing, but asked the jury to show mercy because he is so young. Tsarnaev was 19 when the bombing took place. They said his older brother had power over him and that it was Tamerlan who made all the plans for the bombing. Tamerlan later died in a shootout with police.

Judy Clarke, Tsarnaev's lawyer, described the older brother as Tsarnaev's "sole source of family, of support, of strength." She said Tamerlan had a strong personality. She gave examples of how Tamerlan had influence over Tsarnaev.

Clarke also said Tsarnaev could change. Sister Helen Prejean is a Catholic nun and is against the death sentence. She said she spoke to Tsarnaev and he told her that he was truly sorry.

"The law values life," Clarke said to the jury. She told them that they do not have to vote for death.

## All Jury Members Had To Agree

Before making its decision, the judge told the jury to do several things. They had to agree that Tsarnaev was 18 years old because federal law prevents a death sentence for anyone younger than 18 at the time of the crime. The jury also could not consider anything they may have seen in newspapers or on television.

The jury also had to decide if the government proved "beyond a reasonable doubt" that aggravating factors were involved — meaning that there cannot be any other good explanation for what happened. Only if they all agreed should they sentence him to death, the judge said.

The jury spent 14 hours discussing the case before each one agreed on the sentence of death. Tsarnaev is now the 62nd person on "death row" awaiting execution by the U.S. government.
