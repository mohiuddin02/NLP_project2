Wednesday's Powerball lottery jackpot was worth about $1.6 billion. Two days earlier, a rapper re-posted a meme on Facebook that claimed the lottery could end American poverty.

"Powerball 1.3 billion ÷ U.S. pop 300 million," the meme reads. A meme is a message on a picture that spreads through the Internet. "Everyone receives 4.33 mil. Poverty solved!!"

The lottery was at $1.3 billion before the jackpot amount rose on Wednesday. It was about $1.6 billion when winners were picked.

## Math Was Wrong "But I Get It"

Unfortunately, the Powerball jackpot is not enough for every American to get millions of dollars. As people have pointed out across the Internet, the solution is wrong. $1.3 billion divided by 300 million is actually just $4.33, not enough to lift anyone out of poverty. Also, the U.S. population was 308.7 million as of the 2010 census - and only 234.6 million, if you do not count children under age 18.

So, why have 1.3 million people reshared the meme on Facebook, and why have hundreds of thousands liked it? Some are doubtlessly making fun of the meme's bad math. But others agree strongly with a man named Philipe Andolini, who seems to have made up the equation.

His "math was incorrect but I get it," wrote Livesosa, the rapper whose post made the meme go viral. "Point (he) was attempting to make it simple. There's enough money to feed the people."

## Does Anybody But The Winner Benefit?

In other words, the meme is not really about the Powerball jackpot. How is it - Andolini seems to be arguing - that one person can, in a stroke of unthinkable fortune win $1.3 billion when other people have next to nothing? Isn't there some way to distribute the Powerball money more fairly?

There is some good news, for Andolini and others. Powerball does sort of redistribute money back to "the people," although not in the form of 300 million personal checks, and not at all fairly. Case in point: Low-income people are the biggest players of the lottery, leading many experts to argue that it is a tax on the poor.

Powerball is run by the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL), a nonprofit based in Iowa. It  basically operates several monster games across 36 states and Washington, D.C. Powerball tickets cost $2\. So, when you buy a ticket, about half of your $2 goes to the pot of prize money. A small portion, less than a dime, covers the cost of running the lottery. About 12 or 14 cents also goes to the store that sold the ticket.

## Funding State Projects

But the rest? That goes straight back to the state where you bought your ticket, and your state government decides what to do with it. This varies wildly by state, but the MUSL tracks how the states use their lottery money.

In Arizona, for instance, about $625 million has gone to local transportation since 1982\. In Indiana spent $637 million on money for teachers who retire. In Washington state, the lottery has helped build CenturyLink Field. It is where the Seattle Mariners baseball team plays.

## Using Funds More Wisely

At its heart, Andolini's meme seems to argue that more Powerball money should go to programs that directly reduce poverty. These programs include things like literacy and early childhood reading programs, or meals and transportation for low-income seniors citizens. Kentucky, for instance, has spent $30 million on reading programs. In Pennsylvania, nearly $25 billion has gone to senior programs.

Andolini's meme argues that the Powerball money should be spent more responsibly. And while his method and math are clearly wrong, changing the way states spend their lottery money make lots of sense.

Admittedly, that doesn't sound quite as exciting as a Facebook meme.
