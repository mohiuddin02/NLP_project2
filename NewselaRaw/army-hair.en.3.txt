So, she figured a natural hairstyle would make her a better soldier. Her hair would need less care, especially on military exercises and drills.

"I never had anyone say anything to me about my hair," Jacobs said. She now wears her hair in short twists. "It's never been out of regulation or interfered with my headgear."

That changed in April. The Army announced new rules about how women in uniform can wear their hair. It also made new rules about tattoos.

## No Twists, Cornrows Or Dreadlocks

The rules don't allow certain hairstyles that are popular among black women. These include twists, large cornrow braids and dreadlocks. This all hit a nerve in the black community. It awoke strong feelings over what is "good" or "bad" hair.

Jacobs started a petition to change the rules. She argued that the rules punish the more than 26,000 black women in the Army.

The changes are unfair, the petition says. It also shows a lack of respect for black women and their hair. More than 17,000 people agreed with the petition and signed it. But it needed 100,000 signatures for the president to respond. Still, it did get the attention of the Congressional Black Caucus. The group is made up of the black members of the U.S. Congress. They asked Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to rethink the hair rule.

Troy A. Rolan Sr. is an Army spokesman. He said the Army recognizes the soldiers' concerns. But he said the Army wants hair to look neat and professional.

The new rules also outlaw tattoos on the face, neck, lower arms and hands.

The Army says the rules make sure that everyone looks basically the same. Also, hair can't get in the way of soldiers' caps or helmets. Not all the hairstyles outlawed by the army are worn by black women.

The Army decision stirred up centuries-old arguments over how black women wear their hair. "I just think I said what everyone else was thinking," said Jacobs. She called the new rules hurtful and insulting. Jacobs said she couldn't stay quiet.

## "Straight And Long"

Tarshia Stanley is with Spelman College's English Department. She is an expert on the black female image. She said that black girls are pressured to make their hair look like white girls' hair.

"We have been told for so long and from so many sources that our hair is not good enough and that it must be straight and long," Stanley said. "The relationship between women and their hair has always been deep. But with black women, it has also been a very (complicated) relationship."

Nevertheless, Stanley does not say the Army is being racist.

She said that the decision on the rules has more to do with not understanding what hair means to black women.

"To tell black women that their hair isn't good enough is hurtful," she said.

The new rules say that hair extensions and wigs are allowed. That especially upsets Jacobs.

She said that straightening hair or getting fake hair doesn't make sense. They can damage hair and aren't healthy. "They want us to have a white hair standard," she said.

Jacobs said she stopped straightening her hair about four years ago. The chemical straighteners burned her scalp and she lost patches of hair. She figured going natural would be healthier, safer and easier to take care of.

Jacob's petition got national attention. But she's not hopeful that the Army will give in.

"They have to admit they were uneducated, and say they made a mistake," Jacobs said.

On Tuesday, the defense secretary told the military to rethink the hair rules.

They were not meant to target black people or be hurtful, Hagel wrote to the Black Caucus. "I take your concerns very seriously."
