BEIRUT â€” Nasser Shorbaji and Marwan Alameh run a radio show in a bar in Beirut, Lebanon. They are laughing so hard they almost knock over their microphones.

They get more serious when they play Palestinian hip-hop. They start talking about the war in the Palestinian territory of Gaza. Groups of Israelis and Palestinians have been fighting there. Many have died. Heads nod in the packed bar to the rhymes of a Palestinian rapper.

Shorbaji and Alameh are among several Lebanese graffiti artists and rappers trying to reach young people. Lebanon is in the middle of violence. There is fighting in much of the Middle East. The artists are trying to get young people talking about the violence. Many young people in the Middle East are unhappy about all the problems in the Middle East.

"People don't want to be preached to. So we're just doing a fun thing in order to put out serious issues," Alameh said.

## A Rapper

One example is Shorbaji's latest music video. Shorbaji's song is about a bomber working at a bank. The bank worker is thinking about whether or not to bomb the bank.

Then there is rapper and graffiti artist Omar Kabbani. He runs a rap, graffiti and street clothing group with his brother Mohamed.

"They say I was born with a microphone and my twin brother with a spray can," Kabbani said. He means that while he raps, his brother makes street art.

Their art is often about Lebanon's problems. Many of their designs show "Grendizer." He is a giant war robot from Japanese cartoons. They use Grendizer to make fun of people who follow Lebanon's leaders and their private armies. Kabbani and his brother say many people follow the leaders without thinking. They say the leaders scare people to gain power.

"Many people that were warlords in Lebanon are now ruling the country," Kabbani says. Different groups in Lebanon fought for 15 years. The war ended in 1990. Leaders of armed groups during the war now run Lebanon's government.

## A Street Artist

Ali Rafei is a graffiti and street artist from Tripoli, Lebanon. Fighting has been going on in Tripoli. It spilled over from the civil war in Syria.

Rafei said the wreckage in his city has made space for his street paintings. They can easily be seen and appreciated.

"The emptiness that's there pushes you to create," he said. Rafei hopes to change people's views and make them less angry. People would rather see a drawing "with colors and some meaning to them than a gray wall with pictures of politicians that do nothing for them."
