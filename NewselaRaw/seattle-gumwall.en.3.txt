SEATTLE, Wash. — For 20 years there has been a brick wall in downtown Seattle covered with millions of pieces of "ABC" gum. ABC stands for Already Been Chewed. Tourists, and even locals, liked to come see the colorful wall. They liked to take selfies in front of Seattle's weirdest attraction.

Not long ago that all changed. One day in November, there was a loud, hot burst of steam. Then the great Seattle Gum Wall began oozing away. 

Two workers in protective suits did the dirty job. One worker sprayed hot steam onto the old brick wall. The second scraped off softened gum with a rake. Steam hissed. Clumps of gum fell. The clumps sounded like falling rain.

## Home To A LOT Of Gum

The wall is located in a dark little alley called Post Alley near Seattle's famous fish market. The alley smelled like old mint and fruit. 

People were sad about the wall coming down. "Awww," said one passer-by. "Goodbye!"

Many fans visited the Gum Wall before it came down. Kymberly Dempsey lives near Seattle and even took her four children out of school. They wanted to see to the Gum Wall while they still had the chance. "If you miss it, you'll never get to see it again," said Dempsey. "It's gross, but it's also so colorful that it's kind of beautiful."

The Gum Wall began around 20 years ago. There were long lines of people in Post Alley waiting to get inside the Market Theater to see a show. They became bored waiting in line. They began to stick their used gum to the brick wall outside the theater.

## Gum Selfies And Bridal Portraits

For years, the wads clung to just a few feet of the alley's east wall. Mercedes Carrabba owns a small coffee shop overlooking the Gum Wall. Then came Facebook and Instagram, and so did the gum, she said. People liked to come and take pictures. They posted the photos to Instagram and Facebook. The gum wall grew. By the end, hardened gum covered both walls of Post Alley.

Everyone who came to see the wall liked to talk and laugh with one another, Carrabba added.

Several years ago Allison Hazen and Philip Prahst swooped into the Gum Alley on an August day. Gum is at its goopiest around that time of year. It was their wedding day. Hazen wore a long white dress. They wanted to celebrate the day with a picture in front of the Gum Wall.

It was a perfect moment. They forgot just one thing. The gum.

"We were walking down the ramp, and people started noticing us," Hazen said. The crowd clapped and cheered. One woman even filled Hazen's hands with white gum.

## A City Stuck On The Gum Wall

The crowds had disappeared by the time the cleaning crew set up earlier this month. Only two women from Korea took photos with their cellphones in the early-morning darkness.

They had come to see the Gum Wall before it was removed.

Leonard Garfield runs Seattle's Museum of History & Industry. Before the wall was finished being cleaned, he was asked if he thought the wall would remain gum-free.

He doubted Seattle was ready to leave this important piece of history behind. "It went up. It's coming down. It will go up again," he said.

Garfield was right. As soon as the wall had been scrubbed clean, people began to stick their chewed gum back on the wall.
