JOHANNESBURG — An Ebola epidemic in Lagos, Nigeria, one of the world's most crowded cities, could easily have turned into a nightmare.

If Ebola spread through Nigeria's population of more than 170 million, it could have taken years to end the spread of the deadly disease.

In stopping the outbreak, Nigeria became an extraordinary success story. On Monday, after 42 days without a new case, the country was declared free of the virus by the World Health Organization (WHO).

In all, only 19 people came down with Ebola.  Just seven of them died, a survival rate of 63 percent — more than double the 30 percent average in other West African countries. Thousands have died of the disease in West Africa since March.

## Disease Detective Work

Stopping the outbreak took determination by the country's leaders. Doctors and health centers were shifted from Nigeria's anti-polio campaign to the Ebola effort. Polio is a virus that can cause paralysis.

Nigeria's military helped trace the people with whom Ebola victims came into contact, so they could be checked for signs of the disease. The government sent out tens of thousands of text messages to teach people how to prevent Ebola. Also, wealthy Nigerians contributed more than a million dollars.

It also took a little bit of luck.

The WHO praised Nigeria's "spectacular success story" and the country's "world-class" disease detective work. Nigeria also has reduced the number of polio cases and wiped out another disease called guinea worm.

If Nigeria can beat Ebola, other countries can limit Ebola to just a handful of cases, said Dr. Margaret Chan. She is the director general of the WHO.

## Crisis Began July 23

At the beginning of the Ebola outbreak in Nigeria, the country was in the middle of a strike by doctors and nurses. A strike is when workers stop working to protest something. Dr. Doyin Oduyebo, a microbiologist at the forefront of the Nigerian effort to contain the virus, said medical officials feared the disease would race out of control.

"We were afraid because we knew the epidemic was raging in other West African countries," Oduyebo said. "So we decided to give it everything to bring it under control."

The crisis began July 23 with a Liberian American named Patrick Sawyer. He left Liberia with the disease and was so sick that he vomited during his flight. He collapsed in the airport when he arrived in Nigeria.

At a hospital in Lagos, Sawyer concealed the fact that he had collapsed at the airport from Dr. Morris Ibeawuchi, who examined Sawyer. He also did not say that he had been in close contact with his sister as she lay dying of Ebola, and helped bury her.

Sawyer died five days after arriving in Lagos.

Ibeawuchi became ill too, his temperature soaring. "There was a night I thought my existence on this earth had ended," said Ibeawuchi, who survived.

In April, the militant group Boko Haram kidnapped more than 200 girls from their school in Nigeria. They are still missing. As news spread of Ebola, critics asked how the government, which couldn't find the schoolgirls, could hope to contain the virus.

## Educating The Public

False information spread throughout the country. A pastor claimed on Facebook that he could cure Ebola by touching victims. Another rumor spread by text message advised people to drink as much salt water as they could. Two people reportedly died from trying that.

The government began educating the public. "Everybody in Lagos became aware that there was something called Ebola and that they had to take preventive measures," said Oduyebo. "People ensured that they washed their hands."

The government publicly corrected the wrong information and set up a telephone hotline. At least 57,000 Nigerians received government text messages educating them about the virus.

The government opened a command center, with meetings twice a day. Doctors who worked on wiping out polio were sent into the fight against Ebola.

In late August, Nigerian health workers called off their strike.

## Luck Played A Role

The key to Nigeria's success was the tracking down of nearly every single person who had come into contact with any of the Ebola victims. This was followed up with face-to-face meetings to check them for signs of the disease.

The United States and other countries donated thermometers to check temperatures at airports and border crossings. Two Nigerian billionaires donated more than $1 million to halt the virus. Oil and cellphone companies also gave money.

And perhaps luck played a role. If Sawyer had gone to a remote rural clinic instead of a private hospital in Lagos, the outcome might have been different. The disease might not have been discovered as quickly and he could have infected more people.

Also fortunate was the fact that none of the passengers on the airplane with Sawyer came down with Ebola.

The Nigerian government had a strong will to contain the outbreak. After being criticized about its lack of action in the schoolgirl kidnappings, Nigerian officials were determined to take charge. President Goodluck Jonathan is expected to run for another term as president, and he couldn't afford an Ebola disaster.

This time, his name, Goodluck, seemed to suit him.
