MIAMI — When a 15-year-old Illinois teen found out his father had cancer, he spun out of control. He skipped school, yelled at teachers and punched holes in walls. Stunned by sadness, he sometimes hid in his room.

The teen was deeply depressed. That was causing him to act out. Eventually, he agreed to go to group therapy sessions at his school.

At the sessions, he's learning to identify what sets him off. He also is learning how to calm down before he acts out.

"I think it is a good idea because a lot of people think they don't need help but they actually do," said the teen.

## Not Much Agreement

School violence seems to be increasing. Yet, experts say many teens are struggling with mental illness. This is not being treated — or even identified.

About 10 years ago, U.S. health officials recommended that schools look for the early signs of emotional or behavior problems in children. But it's not required. A review by the Associated Press found that schools handle this in different ways. Schools don't agree on what to look for or at what age to check. They don't agree if schools should screen kids for these problems at all. Screening means checking for the early signs of a problem.

Mike Dennis teaches health care workers how to help people with mental illness and drug use. Schools screen kids for all kinds of diseases, he said. But they don't try to find behavior problems early. This doesn't make sense, he said. When problems are found early, they are easier to treat.

Baltimore and Chicago have strong screening and treatment programs. A South Florida school district screens children in kindergarten. In Minnesota, students answer questions about drug use and their feelings. In Washington, about 21,000 students were screened for drug use and mental health in 2010.

Mental health problems usually start in the teenage years. If not treated, they can lead to drug and alcohol use. Also, kids may drop out of school. These problems can have a big effect on their lives.

## Has Helped Sometimes

Linda Juszczak is the president of a school health group. She said that people need to think carefully about screening all children. The screening tests are not perfect. They will mistakenly find problems in students who don't have them. In other students, the screenings also will fail to find actual problems.

Also, people worry, schools could find problems. But they won't be able to help the kids. They may not have the money or staff to do it.

A Baltimore group has developed a screening tool to find at-risk children. Teams look for children with a parent in prison or addicted to drugs. They also look for kids with bad grades and who get in trouble.

In South Florida, a fourth-grader threatened to attack a teacher's face with a pencil. He was put in the hospital.

Dr. Seth Bernstein called it a missed opportunity. The child was never screened for emotional or behavior problems. A year earlier, a program that offered school support and family counseling ended at his school. He might have been helped through it.

When Matthew Palma was in kindergarten, he was screened through a program at his school. He went to a play group to help him learn how to make friends.

Matthew's mother says he is much more confident now. He isn't afraid to talk to adults or raise his hand in class.
