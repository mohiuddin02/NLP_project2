Facebook and Twitter lit up with signs of support for France following Friday's deadly terror attack in Paris. People posted old photos of themselves in front of the Eiffel Tower. Others said they were praying for Paris. Countless profile pictures were overlaid with the red, white and blue of the French flag.

Then suddenly a story about another terror attack popped up. This time the attack was in Kenya.

"Man, what's happening with the world right now?" one Facebook user wrote.

"147 dead in terrorist attack on Kenya college," actress Bex Taylor-Klaus tweeted. "Hate consumes and destroys."

## Flashback To Earlier Tragedy

One British Broadcasting Corp. news article on the attack was linked to over and over again. The date on the article? April 3, 2015 â€” more than seven months ago.

The news the article reported is as horrifying as the ghastly events in Paris: 148 people were killed by al-Shabab fighters who stormed Kenya's Garissa University College. For those who did not spot the article's date, it seemed like another unfolding story of horror and death.

In time, it became clear to everyone that the article had been published in April. However, a disturbing thought soon occurred to many people: Facebook, Twitter and other social media had barely responded to the Kenya attack when it happened. There was no outpouring of grief and support, as there was following the attack on Paris.

In fact, this old article was clearly the first time many people were hearing about the Kenya attack.

## Treating News Of Horrible Events Unevenly

Some people feel there is a double standard when it comes to the way we react to terrible events. Some deaths seem to matter more to us than others. News sources are a big part of this, as they decide which stories are worth reporting and which are not.

The day before Paris was attacked, Beirut, Lebanon, was also attacked. Beirut and Paris were attacked by the same extremist group, Islamic State. Also called ISIS, the group wants to start its own country under Islamic law and has taken over parts of Syria and Iraq.

Facebook and Twitter barely responded to the Beirut attacks. Overall, the Beirut attacks got much less coverage in the media.

For years many in the United States have said our media treats white deaths as more important than black deaths. The same has been said about missing persons cases. Cases involving missing young white women always seem to receive the most attention.

## We Care When We Feel Close To Victims

What gets covered and why is a complicated issue. A few things seem clear, though: People are more likely to care when terrible things happen to people and places to which they feel close. They are also more likely to show their concern if everyone else is doing the same.

Just think about what happens when a Facebook friend passes away. Mourners write on the person's wall and change their profile pictures to old photos of them together. They fill their status updates with "RIP" and "praying for you." The more posts we see, the more pressure there is to post our own.

"Watching the waves of everyone else grieving can make you feel guilty," says social media expert Kelly Rossetto. "If you're not changing your profile picture, if you're not posting a message," you start to worry that you look uncaring.

## Paris Tugs On Americans' Hearts

Many Americans have personal connections to Paris. They may have vacationed there, or know people who live there. For that reason, they are more affected when Paris suffers, just as they would be when a friend dies. Even Americans who have never set foot in France are familiar with it through books, TV shows and movies.

After the attacks on Paris, what happened on Facebook resembled what happens when a friend dies: Profile pictures changed to those Eiffel Tower selfies, status updates were posted and a "peace for Paris" symbol went viral. Others saw those pictures and statuses, then were asked by Facebook to "Change your profile picture to support France and the people of Paris." Soon, a widespread and heartfelt response to a horrible event became visible for all to see.

Not many Americans have traveled to Kenya or Beirut. However, just because we do not have vacation photos taken in those places, we do not get to ignore their horrible killings.

Deep down, everyone knows that.

So when we feel guilty, what can we do to quickly show we care? We can share a link, even if it is 7 months old.
