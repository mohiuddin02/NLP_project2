WASHINGTON â€” The tallest mountain in North America has a new name. President Barack Obama announced the change on Sunday.

The giant mountain is in Alaska. For years it has been called Mount McKinley. It was named after U.S. President William McKinley. He was president from 1897 to 1901.

The mountain has now been renamed Denali.

The new name is the Native American name for the mountain. It means "the high one."

In Alaska people are very happy about the name change. Many feel it is only right to use the name Native Americans have always used.

## People In Ohio Unhappy About Name Change

Not everyone is happy with the change, though. Many in far away Ohio are angry. McKinley was from Ohio.

Lawmakers in Ohio attacked the name change. They said it was as if McKinley was being cut out of history.

The change "is insulting to all Ohioans," Ohio lawmaker Bob Gibbs said.

Obama announced the name change just before leaving for Alaska. He will be spending three days there.

Obama will talk about a lot of serious problems while he is in Alaska. The main problem has to do with the weather.

## Warmer Weather Causing Problems In Alaska

It has been getting warmer all around the world. Alaska is one of the places where that has led to problems.

Scientists think the warming is caused by people. When people burn coal and oil the burning lets off gases. These gases remain in the air and trap heat. Over time it becomes hotter everywhere. Scientists call this global warming.

Alaska is very cold. Still, warmer weather is causing all sorts of problems in Alaska.

Giant blocks of ice are melting away. The ice has been there for millions of years. The melting ice is also causing the sea to rise. The shore is being eaten away.

Obama hopes his trip will make more countries realize how serious the problem is. He is making a promise for the U.S. to stop burning so much coal and oil. He wants other countries to make such promises.
