The refugees live in a camp for people left homeless because of fighting in their country. The rush for food marked the end of their first daylong fast. During the holy Muslim month of Ramadan, they must not eat from sunrise to sunset.

Shouting men scrambled Sunday to reach pots of rice, meat and chicken stew in this dusty, hot refugee camp. It sits some 60 miles (100 kilometers) from the northern city of Irbil. The city is the capital of Iraq's Kurdish region.

The chaotic scene at the camp highlights the fears of Iraqis as they begin Ramadan. The nation is gripped by violence and anger. People are bitterly divided by their religious beliefs. Most Iraqis are Arab, but they are divided between two large religious groups, Sunnis and Shiites. They practice two different branches of Islam. Nowadays, the two groups are frequently at odds in the country. The fighting between them is edging the country toward civil war.

Shiites are the majority and they run the government. Sunnis are the minority. Yet, under Saddam Hussein, the Sunnis ran the country. Sunni rebels are trying to take back power. The Kurds are not Arab. They have their own region and have mostly stayed out of the conflict. Many Arab Iraqis are fleeing to the Kurdish region for safety.

## For One Family, Soup, Rice And Meat

Bashir Khalil, 39, is a Shiite and his wife Nidal is a Sunni. For them, Ramadan has been robbed of its rhythm of community and togetherness.

The couple fled Iraq's second-largest city of Mosul after it was captured by Sunni extremists earlier this month. The family has always been poor. But in their poor section of the city, neighbors shared food. Here, when the food ended, there would be no more until another charity came by.

"When this food finishes, there'll be nothing else," 34-year-old Nidal Khalil sadly said.

She and her husband fled after being forcefully questioned by members of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS). The group is made of Sunni fighters and was once part of the al-Qaida terrorist group. Later it broke off. In the last two weeks, ISIS has seized large parts of northern and western Iraq, including Mosul. It is trying to set up its own Sunni country in parts of Iraq and Syria. The country would be governed by Sunni law.

ISIS doesn't consider Shiites to be true Muslims. Bashir was questioned because he was a Shiite. Nidal was questioned because she worked as a cleaner in a Shiite charity.

They returned days later after local gunmen assured them that they wouldn't be harmed. Yet, they came back to find their home had been damaged in the fighting.

"We don't want this one or that one," Nidal Khalil said, speaking of the Shiite-led government and the Sunni fighters. "Neither of them cares about us poor people."

Her mother-in-law, Shamsa, sat nearby, smoking a cigarette. Fasting Muslims are not supposed to smoke, eat or drink during daylight hours. But the 70-year-old woman shrugged and said she couldn't fast in the heat.

A local television station had donated the food on this day. Bashir Khalil did not manage to get any of it. However, his 10-year-old daughter, Sara, managed to grab a bag filled with containers of soup, rice and meat.

## For Another Family, A Roasted Chicken

At the camp's edge, it was quiet in tent D42. There, another refugee named Umm Mishal watched the sun go down. She sat alongside her youngest daughter Amal, who wore a torn red dress.

"Ramadan is a generous, blessed month. We will not go hungry," the 49-year-old woman said. At the same time, she complained that other families had taken more than their fair share of the donated food, chaotically distributed off the back of trucks.

"They have grape juice," she said, pointing at another family.

Then she set out the family's dinner on a plastic sheet. It bore the symbol of the United Nations. The donated food included soup, rice, a loaf of bread, a small roasted chicken and sliced watermelon.

The evening's meal was taken care of. Suddenly giddy, she exclaimed, "God has blessed us!"

She said with a giggle, "Eat some chicken!"
