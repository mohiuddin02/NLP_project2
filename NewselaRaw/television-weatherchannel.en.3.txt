BREEZY POINT, N.Y. — The sky is cloudless here. But Stephanie Abrams has disaster on her mind.

Abrams is a meteorologist, or weather expert, working for the Weather Channel. She is in Breezy Point to co-host the network's morning shows for the start of hurricane season. The channel expects there to be more storms than usual this year.

The town was pounded by Superstorm Sandy last year.

"It only takes one — one Sandy or Katrina in order for the entire U.S. or the entire world to feel that hurt and pain," she said. Seconds later, viewers watching the show live on TV saw a scary picture of wind and rain. The station called itself Hurricane Central.

Bad weather is good business for the Weather Channel.

## Blizzards Bring Viewers

The channel has been helped by all the blizzards, hurricanes and tornadoes in recent years. It has brought in more money while some other networks have struggled.

Even when the weather in most of the country is mild, the channel's coverage tends toward intensity. Big pictures and capital letters warn of what bad weather could be coming. The company offers more information through its website and mobile apps. It even changed its name to Weather Co. from Weather Channel last year,

But some people do not like how the Weather Channel, which most still call it, covers storms. Critics say it offers more entertainment than information.

It decided last year to start giving names to winter storms. The decision upset meteorologists and the National Weather Service, which is responsible for naming hurricanes.

It named the snowstorm that blanketed much of the East Coast in February "Nemo." Its coverage featured headlines such as "YOU MUST PREPARE NOW." It showed pictures of snow and wind that looked more like the Ice Age than a snowstorm.

## A Flood Of Money

But advertisers love big storms. The last three months of 2012 included Sandy and some other big winter storms. It was a great for the company, said executive Curt Hecht. The company made more money selling ads during Sandy than it had during any other hurricane, he said. A lot more people watched the channel then, too.

The company is showing more video from big storms. It has also added things to its website that are barely related to the weather. Things like pictures of women in bathing suits.

NBC and two other companies bought the Weather Channel in 2008. Since then, the Weather Channel started airing more programs like "Deadliest Space Weather."

That's a big change from the Weather Channel's early days. The channel started in 1982. The idea was to bring local weather information to viewers across the country.

## "It Just Feeds On Itself"

"I can't watch the Weather Channel anymore," said Carson Glover in New York. "They have pictures of lawn chairs tipped over, it gets people needlessly anxious, and then it just feeds on itself," he said.

Nowadays, people can find weather forecasts on their phones or online. So the Weather Channel had to give viewers something different, analyst Brian Wieser explained.

Longtime viewers seem divided over the company's new direction. The channel's Facebook page shows the split.

"I am captivated by the excitement &amp; adventurous &amp; scientific explanations of these Historic Events. Love it!!!!" wrote one viewer.

"I am old. I remember when the Weather Channel actually was weather coverage 24/7/365 not this crap they put on now," wrote another.

## On A Stormy Beach

But executives say that viewers are becoming more interested in weather. People see destruction from storms such as Sandy and Katrina, which flooded New Orleans. They want to know if they will see more really bad weather soon.

The company's first goal is to prepare people who could be in danger from storms, said Weather Co chairman David Kenny. But it also wants to explain the weather and show how terribly bad it can be.

That might be part of the struggle the Weather Co. will face. It may be tough to tell people about the weather and show how dangerous it is without exaggerating.

"Certain stations put a guy on the beach to get good visuals," said Jeffrey Lazo, who studies the public's demand for weather forecasts. "But it's not necessarily the smartest thing to do."
