On a sunny afternoon, the words pour out of 19-year-old Celestelle Webster and 18-year-old Christelle Roach. The feelings they express are both fierce and startling.

"The bones in my body are like needles in my skin … I am a bomb, take shelter."

The two are in a small auditorium at the Miami Beach Regional Library. Facing each other onstage, they summon a wrenching vision of domestic violence with lines they wrote together.

"Why are you still here? I'm in love with the arsonist … There is a fire burning inside me."

Webster's and Roach's verbal fire has been ignited by WordSpeak, a teenage spoken-word poetry program run by Miami's Tigertail Productions. In July, that program will send them and five others to a national poetry competition.

Now in its ninth year, WordSpeak teaches young people the craft of articulating their feelings and ideas. At the same time, it gives them a powerful sense of purpose, empowerment and responsibility.

## Chaos And Rhythm Come Together

Key to that process is WordSpeak coach Teo Castellanos. Before becoming an award-winning theater writer, director and teacher, Castellanos grew up around drugs and gangs in Carol City, Florida. This history helps him to communicate easily with kids from a similar background. Conducting one of the team's recent four-hour rehearsals, Castellanos shifts seamlessly between street slang and a relentlessly precise focus on language, rhythm, performance and meaning.

The team will need to be at the top of its game when it arrives at the Brave New Voices competition in Philadelphia this month. It will be competing with 500 other teens from across the United States and abroad.

In rehearsal, Castellanos urges Roach and Webster not to forget "your intentions, your goals, your rhythms. …You'll find the chaos — it's the hardest rhythm for most people."

Next up are Wesly Oviedo, Steffon Dixon and Al Alexandre. Their poem is on gun murders and Florida's stand-your-ground law, a law that allows Florida residents to use force including a gun in self-defense without retreating first. The law was recently used to defend a man who shot and killed a young, unarmed African American teenager. The boys, who are African-American and Afro-Caribbean, take the subject personally, saying heatedly: "I feel like Florida is the gunshine state and I'm living in the bottom of the barrel."

Castellanos proclaims himself pleased — but pushes for improvement. He suggests changes in wording and a more dramatic performance, starting with a feeling of celebration so the shift to describing the murders will be more startling.

"Don't fear going overboard," he tells them. "The farther you go, the more dramatic the shift — it's gonna be crazy!"

## Building Writing And Speaking Skills

The seven members of the team were selected from approximately 1,000 South Florida teenagers who participate in WordSpeak and SpeakOut, its sister program. The program features classes and workshops, visits from nationally known guest teachers, and several poetry slams, or competitions, to choose the team.

Tigertail director Mary Luft says the goal is to give WordSpeak's participants a sense of confidence and possibility, as well as skills in literacy and self-expression.

"In one year," Luft says, "you'll see a radical change in the way they command the space, their writing quality, what they're writing about, how they speak, how they present themselves — they are empowered."

She added, "It's an opportunity for a young person to find a door to their life. They start thinking differently about their place in the greater world and what else is out there."

Maylin Enamorado started performing her poetry as a freshman in the writing program at Miami Arts Charter School (MAC). At first she was afraid of getting onstage, and she was shocked when she was chosen for the WordSpeak team in her sophomore year.

But when they arrived in San Franciso for the competition, she was excited to be in a literary city with hundreds of other kids for who love poetry.

"For the first time, I was like, poetry is normal!" Enamorado says. "I felt completely at home — and the creativity, the subjects were eye-opening."

Instead of going to college, Enamorado, who graduated from high school this year, will head off to teach in Senegal in August.

"I don't think I would have had the courage to go to Africa without WordSpeak," she says. "The program has made me feel strongly about bringing about change — we try to make a difference."

Enamorado and her fellow program members are an impressive and determined crew. Webster has won a full-tuition scholarship to Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts. Roach also is a musician who started in Miami Arts Charter's music program before switching to writing. Oviedo, 17, is a drama student at MAC, and Dixon just graduated from Design and Architecture Senior High School in industrial design.

## Pens, Pencils And Poetry

Castellanos, who has been the WordSpeak team's coach for eight years, says many of the kids are unusually independent and self-reliant — even with parents who are dealing with drug addiction or other problems.

But in a world that idolizes sports and pop music, even the most independent teenager can use the support of teachers and friends who share their love for poetry and language. Roach says she's the only artist in a family focused on sports and business, "the pen in the box of pencils," who wrote poetry at her brother's basketball games.

She began at MAC as a violist in the school orchestra before switching to poetry, and this is her second year with the WordSpeak team.

"Everyone has such vast knowledge — I feel like I have so many books open to me," says Roach. "I've changed in that I know how to say what I'm feeling."
