ST. LOUIS — As the Reverand Al Sharpton called on mourners at Michael Brown's funeral to come together to launch a nationwide drive for change, Camille Foster thrust her hand high and leapt to her feet.

"Yes sir! Yes sir!" Foster, 22, belted out Monday as Brown's funeral soared into a national soul searching over race and justice and the number of young African-American men who have died in cities like Ferguson, Missouri. The 18-year-old unarmed black teen was killed Aug. 9 by a white police officer.

More than 2,500 people packed the Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church to remember Brown. His mother, Lesley McSpadden, stood as if in shock, staring at her son's casket and shaking her head back and forth as a tear rolled down her cheek. Brown's cousin, Bernard Ewing, choked back tears as he spoke.

"I love you Mike. That's all I've got to say," Ewing said, standing on a stage behind a casket piled with red roses and a St. Louis Cardinals baseball cap.

## "A New Civil Rights Movement"

The memorial drew people from across the country, many of whom never met Brown. There were Hollywood celebrities like Spike Lee, Wesley Snipes and MC Hammer. Also, there were the relatives of other young black people who have been killed in similar circumstances. These included the relatives of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed teen who was killed by a Florida man in Florida in 2012, and Emmett Till, a 14-year-old who was murdered in Mississippi in 1955 after whistling at a white woman.

There were many people who drove or flew from across the country. Most of them were black but a few of them were white, hoping to be part of a day that many believed would become part of the history of race in America.

"A lot of people feel they could be next," said Chris Gray, 29, who came from Minneapolis, Minnesota. "There's a historic possibility here for young people to take ownership of a new civil rights movement."

Sharpton told the crowd that Brown's death must mark the beginning of a change — not just in the justice system, but also the African-American community.

"Nobody is going to help us if we don't help ourselves," said Sharpton, a well-known civil rights activist. Sharpton challenged listeners to stop "sitting around having ghetto pity parties."

## Service Somber But Uplifting

"We can't have a fit. We've got to have a movement," he bellowed from the pulpit, blasting protesters who looted stores after Brown's death. "A fit — you get mad and run out for a couple of nights. A movement means we've got to be here for the long haul and turn our chance into change, our demonstration into legislation."

Other speakers talked especially about the need to vote, an issue that is at the heart of the power imbalance in Ferguson. About 14,000 of Ferguson's 21,000 residents are black, but the City Council and Police Department are overwhelmingly white. In the last municipal election, just 12.3 percent of Ferguson residents came out to vote.

DeeNa Adair, 41, who took part in the protests, came to the funeral with her husband and 10-month-old grandson, Zion.

"If we don't stand up now, what is his future?" said Adair, who said she had lost a 20-year-old son to gun violence in downtown St. Louis.

"Hopefully ... this is what sparks the nation to change, to deal with the racial divide," Adair said.

By turns, the service was politically charged, somber and uplifting as a choir sang gospel songs and women pounded tambourines and shook maracas. Men, women and children, dressed in starched suits and elaborate dresses, swayed in unison, danced and held their hands toward the sky.

## Attitudes Toward Police Differ

There were only a handful of white faces in the crowd, perhaps a reflection of nationwide attitudes toward police. A survey conducted after Brown's killing found that whites are far more likely than blacks to feel confident that police will treat people of both races equally. The survey was released Monday by the Pew Research Center and USA Today.

The survey found that 46 percent of blacks have "very little" confidence that police will treat blacks and whites equally, compared with 12 percent of whites.

"They think because they wear a badge, they hold life in their hands," said Demond Wright, 23, a dishwasher from Ferguson.

"The reality is, this is happening all over the country — the criminalization of young black men," said Nate Parker, 34, an actor and producer from Pasadena, California. Parker flew to Missouri after realizing he had no answer for his 17-year-old nephew, who asked him what he should do if stopped by police.

"The real question is how many days will pass before another unarmed black man is killed?" Parker said.

Nobody has been charged in Brown's death. It could be mid-October before the grand jury decides whether there is enough evidence to indict the officer who shot Brown. Officials say the officer, Darren Wilson, fired in self-defense after Brown attacked him. Some witnesses say Wilson shot Brown after ordering him to stop walking down the middle of his street.

Eric Harris, 18, who lives in St. Louis, did not know Brown, but identified with the dead teen. "But you don't have to be acting up to be targeted," Harris said. "You can just be walking home from the store and bang, you're a target."
