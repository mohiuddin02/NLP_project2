LOS ANGELES — Help wanted: At least 130 veteran military aviators. Must make a nine-year commitment to fly fighter jets.

Salary: Pay range $34,500 to $97,400. Plus good benefits and a $225,000 signing bonus — guaranteed.

Contact: U.S. Air Force by Sept. 30.

That offer is from the U.S. Department of Defense. It is so short of Air Force fighter pilots that it is offering more money than ever before to help attract pilots.

It may be hard to imagine that the life of a fighter pilot is no longer as appealing as it used to be. But this year the Air Force has a shortage of 200 fighter pilots. And if something isn't done, it may be short 700 pilots by 2021. Currently, it has about 3,000 fighter pilots.
## Commercial Pilot Pay Is Higher

Empty cockpits are bad news for the military. It spends about $6 million to train a single fighter pilot. It is also already shoveling money into the development of the world's most expensive plane, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter jet. This is expected to cost nearly $400 billion.

Several factors are behind the shortage, officials said. Pilots are leaving the military to take better-paying jobs with commercial airlines. They are leaving because life in the military can be hard for people with families. Many have been reassigned to operate combat [drones](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone). These are the remote-controlled planes that have reshaped modern warfare.

The Air Force wants to get as many as possible of the 200 to 250 eligible fighter pilots to take the deal. Some already have signed on.

After they've served for 11 years, pilots can decide if they want to leave the military or stay for another 5 years. Today, just 65 percent of pilots are deciding to stay. That's compared with 80 percent in 1993. The Air Force hopes its new offer will make more pilots decide not to leave.

Air Force pilots typically earn about $90,000 by the time they finish their 11th year. The median annual wage of airline pilots, copilots and flight engineers is $103,210.

There have been fighter pilot shortages in the past, but the competition promises to be fierce in the years to come. Airlines are on the hunt for young talent because many commercial pilots will be retiring in the next few years.
## Airlines Will Need More Pilots

A report released last year estimated that 460,000 new commercial pilots will need to be hired around the world over the next two decades. There are currently more than 71,000 active airline pilots in the United States.

Neither US Airways nor American Airlines has hired pilots in more than a decade. They are now beginning a large recruiting effort to fill spots.

US Airways and American are expecting the retirement of more than 2,100 pilots within the next five years. Pilots must retire at the age of 65.

"The airlines are going to have more money to pay for pilots than the government," said Rob Streble of the US Airline Pilots Association.

Streble himself left the Air Force in the early 1990s to take a job with US Airways. "The military is difficult on the family with all the moving around," he said. "I added more stability by joining the airline."

There is one important reason why commercial airlines will be more eager than ever to hire military pilots: a new Federal Aviation Administration rule. This requires U.S. commercial co-pilots to have 1,500 hours of flying experience, the same as captains. Currently, first officers only need to have a commercial pilot certificate. To get this, only 250 hours of flight time are necessary.
## Fighter Pilots Flying Drones

Dennis Prokopowicz, a pilot with Jet Blue Airways, said it will be difficult for civilian pilots to achieve that many hours. It is much easier for military pilots to gain that level of experience.

"That kind of experience ... is hard to come by" for a civilian pilot, he said. "Renting a Cessna [airplane] can cost around $100 per hour. You don't have to pay for that in the Air Force."

The Air Force said part of its problem is training new pilots. The shortage of veteran pilots has resulted in a lack of trainers.

Another problem is the heavy use of drones. Drones went from being a handful of aircraft on Sept. 11 to the "fastest growing part of the force," said Peter W. Singer, author of "Wired for War," a book about robotic warfare.

As a result, pilots were plucked from fighter jet assignments and placed in control of MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper drones. In all, 153 fighter pilots were permanently reassigned to drones.

Because of the growing pilot shortage, the Air Force recently stopped using fighter pilots for drones.
## A Thrilling, But Hard, Life

John Wigle, a former F-15 fighter pilot and current Air Force program analyst, said the problem for the Air Force is simply that it is hard to find enough trained people to serve as long-term fighter pilots. He added that life as a fighter pilot, while often thrilling, is very difficult.

"People have no idea how hard it is when you have to move your family all the time," he said. "Military life is not for everyone."
