Taylor Swift has been all over the news. She released a new album, called "1989," and soon after, she took her music off Spotify, the world's biggest streaming music service.

Over the summer, Swift wrote an article for the Wall Street Journal, a financial newspaper. The 24-year-old songwriter used the newspaper to share her hopeful view of the music business. "The music industry is not dying ... it's just coming alive," she wrote.

Some thought it was easy for her to say. The week her album was released, Swift sold almost 1.3 million copies. She sold almost as many albums as every other artist put together the week before.

Swift's upbeat attitude might come from her own lucky position. She works hard at selling her music by talking with her fans on social media like Twitter.

## iTunes Versus Spotify

In the article she wrote for the newspaper, Swift had important points to make about the business of music. "Music should not be free," she wrote.

On iTunes, Swift can make 70 cents for every dollar a fan spends buying her music. But on Spotify, she would make less than a penny for each song her fans listened to.

Many in the music business see streaming as the only hope. Before the Internet, people would buy records, tapes or CDs to listen to music. When people started owning computers, there were ways of downloading music for free. It was illegal, but people still stole music from their favorite bands and singers.

Now, some people think streaming services like Spotify or YouTube could earn back some of that money. Because it is cheap, people will pay for the service. It will not pay the musician as much, but they will still see some money.

Still, a growing number of big artists have taken down some or all of their music from the service such as artists like Beyonc√© and the Beatles.

## "Getting A Fair Cut"

Patrick Carney, a drummer for the rock band the Black Keys, argued against the service. "My whole thing about music is: If somebody's making money, then the artist should be getting a fair cut of it," he told one newspaper.

In her article over the summer, Swift wrote: "Music is art, art is important and rare. Important, rare things are valuable. Valuable things should be paid for."

Her idea is noble. It would be easier to live by if the Internet had never happened. Still, if the Internet had never happened, Swift wouldn't have 46 million followers.

Many agree with Swift. They believe that if musicians can afford to not use streaming services like Spotify, they should not give their art away.

Smaller bands still have a problem. If an unknown band is trying to become famous, they have to be heard by people. These bands need to get their music out any way they can. Some bands make money by giving concerts or letting their songs be used in TV and video games. However, they still need to give fans a chance to hear their music first.

## Bands And Fans

Fans have a problem with streaming, too. Music companies own the music fans listen to. Rather than letting fans own their collection, the music business is moving toward a model like Netflix. Fans can listen to any song, whenever and wherever. However, the fan must pay every time. Sometimes they pay Spotify. Other times, they must listen to an advertisement.

Having so many choices also makes it hard for fans to bond with a favorite artist. It is one reason why live concerts have become so important. Bands can make money from fans paying to see them perform. Concerts also give fans a chance to really connect with the artists they love.

Swift is an expert at connecting with her fans. Even pulling her music off Spotify has helped her. Her fans must prove how much they love her by buying her album.
