YELM, Wash. — The ground is shaking at Lackamas Elementary School in Yelm. Students and geologists huddle around a computer, watching jagged lines scroll across the screen and measuring a mini-earthquake.  

The students are not really experiencing an earthquake. Their 11- and-12-year-old classmates caused it by leaping into the air together and landing with a thud that vibrated the ground.

Geologist Recep Cakir explains that he and his crew are measuring the way seismic waves move through the soil. The scientists work for the Washington Department of Natural Resources. They want to estimate how hard the ground will shake in future earthquakes.

The work is part of a test project that involves several Washington public schools. Scientists are trying to tell how well the buildings will stand up to a major quake.

## Facing Threats From Nature

The project is testing the seismic safety of 15 schools in three districts in the western part of the state. Scientists were given $45,000 from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), a government department. Engineers are also volunteering their time to inspect buildings.

John Schelling works for Washington's Emergency Management Division. He says the bigger goal is to develop a standard process that could be applied to schools across the state. "The time is right to look at the state of the science," Schelling says. 

Over the last 25 years, scientists studied the area between the Pacific Ocean and the Rocky Mountains, called the Pacific Northwest. They discovered that there is a chance the region will suffer huge earthquakes and tsunamis. 

A fault in the ocean floor called the Cascadia Subduction Zone could cause the disasters. Other Washington cities also have places where sections of the outer layer of the Earth, the crust, move. Those areas could also experience earthquakes when giant plates in the crust run into each other. 

## Schools Predate Present-Day Building Codes

Many of the state's schools are older than the modern building codes that address those dangers. State school officials calculated possible damage. They used a FEMA model and an estimate based on the types of buildings across Washington. They found that a magnitude-9 Cascadia quake could cause more than $4 billion in damages and loss of services at schools. It could also kill 117 students and school staff and injure more than 3,000. Earthquakes are measured on a magnitude scale which compares the size of earthquakes. A magnitude-9 quake would be very strong.

Another FEMA study estimates that half the schools along Washington's coast would suffer medium to high damage. No one really knows how widespread the risk is. 

Schelling says, "Washington is really the only state on the West Coast that hasn't completed a detailed, comprehensive assessment of all school facilities." 

## Lagging In Seismic Assessments

California started upgrading schools in the 1930s, and Oregon conducted a survey earlier this year. Oregon found that 1,100 school buildings might be at a high risk of collapse in a major earthquake. Oregon lawmakers then set aside $300 million to upgrade schools and other buildings.

"I think it's pretty safe to say it's a similar story in Washington," says Cale Ash of Degenkolb Engineers. Ash is helping coordinate the Washington project and donating his time to inspect school buildings. "The two states have similar ages of construction."

British Columbia, Canada, made seismic safety a priority ten years ago. The Canadian province has spent $2.2 billion to strengthen high-risk schools.

In Washington, the seismic safety of schools is mainly the job of school districts. Seattle has upgraded most of its older school buildings, and several projects are in the works. In poorer districts there is little money to pay for upgrades. A survey identified seven schools and other buildings at high risk of collapse in the city of Aberdeen.

Many districts have not evaluated the seismic safety of their schools. The Washington State Seismic Safety Committee recommended that Washington pay for a statewide survey, but state lawmakers failed to act.

## Danger From Potential Tsunami

State education officials recently analyzed earthquake, flood and other natural hazards that schools across the state might face. They found that 32 schools and other buildings sit in the likely path of a Cascadia tsunami. However, only 25 of the state's 295 school districts have signed on for a more detailed study of the threats they could face.

During the pilot project, engineers are inspecting each school, looking for structural weaknesses and dangers like bookshelves that are not bolted to the wall. Those observations will be combined with the information that Cakir and his team of geologists are gathering on how shaky the ground is at each site. A report on the project is expected in February.

Tim Walsh is the chief hazards geologist for the Washington Department of Natural Resources. He says expanding the survey program across the state would cost about $13 million and take about eight years.
