LONDON â€” New government documents suggest that spy agencies can collect personal information from smartphones across the globe. They get the information when people play games or use apps on their phones.

The documents were leaked by Edward Snowden. He used to do work for the National Security Agency (NSA), a U.S. spy agency. These aren't the first documents he's leaked. Over the past several months he's released other documents and given them to a newspaper. The documents show how the NSA watches Americans' phone calls and emails.

The newest documents were published Monday by The New York Times. The British newspaper the Guardian and ProPublica also published the documents.

Apps are common on the world's roughly 1 billion smartphones. People download map apps, games, and social networking apps like Facebook. The leaked documents suggest that America's NSA and Britain's GCHQ spy agency have worked together to gain information from the apps.

## Leak About "Leaky" Apps

Some apps are considered "leaky." The apps can feed huge amounts of personal information to the spy agencies. A person's location can be found. Even details such as a person's political or romantic interests can be discovered.

The size of the program isn't known. Yet, the reports suggest that U.S. and British intelligence can easily collect information from apps. Two of the biggest apps mentioned in reports are "Angry Birds" and Google Maps.

A 2008 document from the GCHQ describes the spying program. It says that the program "effectively means that anyone using Google Maps on a smartphone is working in support of a GCHQ system."

The NSA did not directly comment on the reports. The NSA says that it is not interested in "the smartphone or social media communications of everyday Americans." The agency says it collects "only those communications that we are authorized by law to collect."

The agency says that it monitors phones for good reason. Often, they are used in planning terrorist activities like bombings.

GCHQ said it does not comment on spying. It insisted, however, that all of its activity was legal and "necessary."

It's been known for a while that spy groups are interested in cellphones and the networks they use. Several of Snowden's previous leaks said as much. The interest in apps, however, is new. It shows how even harmless-looking pieces of software can be used for spying.

## Many Monitored Sites Shown

"Angry Birds" was one of the most eye-catching examples. The addictive game has been downloaded more than 1.7 billion times worldwide. The game lets players fling birds at pigs to destroy them. The Times and ProPublica said a 2012 British spy report laid out how to gather "Angry Bird" users' information from phones.

Another document published to the Web was a 14-page-long NSA slideshow. It listed a host of other apps. Ones made by Facebook, photo sharing site Flickr, and the film app Flixster were being monitored.

It wasn't clear precisely what information can be collected. And from which apps. One of the slides gave the example of a user who uploaded a photo using a social media app. A phone's settings, where it connected to, and which websites it had visited could be looked at. Also, which documents it had downloaded and who its users' friends were could all be found.

Google did not immediately comment on the reports. Neither did Rovio Entertainment, the maker of "Angry Birds."

The Times briefly posted a secret U.S. document on the smartphone spying to the Web Monday. It contained material that appeared to publish the name of an NSA employee. Computer experts said they were able to discover the name of the employee. They also picked out the name of a Middle Eastern terror group the NSA was targeting. Details about the types of computer files the NSA considered useful were also found.

Snowden began leaking documents in June. His supporters have claimed they have been careful not to release the names of any spies. They claim to have kept quiet any details that could put ongoing spying at risk.

A Times spokeswoman said the information had been posted by error. The material has since been removed.
