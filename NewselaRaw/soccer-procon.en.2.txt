### PRO: Talk soccer to me please!

VIENNA, Va. — Unbelievably, World Cup soccer has become the thing to talk about.

In recent weeks, television ratings for the sport have soared. Games involving Team USA have equaled the recent NBA finals and surpassed baseball's World Series. "Watch Parties" drew tens of thousands nationwide and huge crowds at AT&amp;T Stadium in Dallas and Soldier Field in Chicago.

This time around America embraced the "beautiful game." We were gripped by the stunning goals and puzzling offsides, joyous patriotism and comic-looking flops due to several key reasons:

Convenient starting times: First-round group games from Brazil began at noon, with another contest to follow and the final match in early evening on the East Coast. They soon became a great reason to skip out early from work.

Short matches: The games take 2 1/2 hours to play. Without timeouts, except for an occasional water break due to the jungle heat, you can set your watch by soccer. Less than three hours to watch a sporting event? That's been downright delightful and makes you realize what time-vampires baseball, football and even college basketball have become with their commercial breaks and constant timeouts.

## The Underdogs Had Their Share Of Shots

Shaky goaltenders: Few keepers demonstrated they could single-handedly steal a game for their side. Any shot became a good shot in Brazil. That's quite different from hockey's Stanley Cup playoffs, for example, where you sometimes wonder if anybody is going to score.

Upsets galore: After the dust settled in Week One, reigning champion Spain and always powerful England had already been eliminated. That left the door open for such countries as Colombia, Costa Rica, Algeria and Chile to show their stuff.

"USA, USA:" Despite being placed in the same division with such heavyweights as Germany, Ghana and Portugal, the Americans made it out of the so-called "Group of Death." They took Belgium to overtime before being eliminated.

To his credit, American coach Jurgen Klinsmann urged his team to fight it out with the traditional soccer powers and thanks to scoring star Clint Dempsey and such youngsters as DeAndre Yedlin (20 years old) and Julian Green (19) that often happened. That's a far cry from former American squads in the World Cup.

Team USA may be out of this year's tournament, but it didn't go quietly. If anything it left the world stage with some attitude, even defiance. That could make all the difference in the years ahead.

## They Liked It, Now Maybe They'll Play It More

For decades, kids in this country, as in the rest of the world, have grown up playing soccer. Drive through suburbia on the weekends, and you'll see fields of tykes chasing a speckled ball.

Until now, that's where it ended. Once kids stopped playing the game, they fell into the more traditional viewing habits of football, baseball and basketball.

Yet this time around, more Americans checked out the World Cup than ever before and they often enjoyed what they saw. For once you give the beautiful game a long look, as the rest of the world knows, it's difficult to turn away. Especially when you're cheering a team that refuses to back down.

### CON: Still don't get it, what's the draw to soccer?

WASHINGTON - Soccer is easy to mock and make fun of.  In what other sport can we put together a scorecard of the number of fake "injuries" or the time the supposedly injured players spent squirming on the ground?

Or in which "injured" players are regularly carried off on stretchers only to return to the game seconds later. When's the last time you saw that in any American sport?

But I am not here to mock.  I've tried to like soccer.  It seemed like the open-minded thing to do.

## I Gave It A Best Effort

Let me set the stage: it is the summer of 1994 and I am a graduate student living in London.  Each summer, the dormitory in which I lived had an arrival of Italian students who, in a pleasant example of international outreach, insisted that I watch the World Cup with them.

I did so, game in and game out, in the name of sportsmanship and good will. And, to the joy of my newfound friends, Italy progressed all the way to the final against mighty Brazil.

And so we watched what I was told would be sports at its best. For 90 minutes we watched. And no one scored. We watched through extra time and still no one scored.

At last the game was settled through a shootout, in which the goalie guesses at which side of the goal the opposing player will kick the ball and dives in that general direction. Italy's goalie guessed wrong and Brazil walked off the World Cup champions. A coin flip might have been slightly less dramatic, but the effect was pretty much the same.

This helps explain why soccer may be the world's sport, but not yet America's. I don't begrudge my foreign friends' love of soccer. And I am honest enough to admit that baseball is pretty dull.

## American Sports Just Make More Strategic Sense

Soccer is a fine game. However, American football and basketball are a battle, based on craftiness, drive and the repeated attack on the opponent's weaknesses.

When a football or basketball coach isolates a gap in the opposing team's strategy — or plan — or a mismatch of players, he will take advantage of that weakness again and again. And his team will score points as a result.

The level of teamwork and coordination demanded of athletes, and strategic thinking of coaches, is simply far higher in American sports. And a strategic error by coaches or a major playing mistake by athletes on the field will almost always cost that team on the scoreboard.

Sure, a basketball or American football game can be decided by a lucky play or a bad call, if it's very close. But the relative ease by which teams can score in the most popular U.S. sports makes it very unlikely that the better team will lose the game. Not so in soccer, which is filled with fine plays that go unrewarded and terrible errors that go unpunished.

## It's All Fun At The End Of The Day

Or simply consider basic numbers and statistics such as time of possession, which measures which team controls the ball throughout the game.

Controlling the ball is a basic measure of how much a team maintained the upper hand in a game. In American football, the team that wins the battle for ball-control wins the game around two-thirds of the time. In soccer, by contrast, time of possession appears to be unrelated to victory. American sports are famously buried in numbers, but all these stats are meaningful in understanding who won and why.

At the end of the day, sports are entertainment.

Millions of people apparently enjoy watching a bunch of men kick a ball around for 90-plus minutes only to end in a scoreless tie. Well, that's OK by me.
