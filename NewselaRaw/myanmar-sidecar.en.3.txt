YANGON, Myanmar â€” Linn Naing is one of the thousands of bicycle cab drivers in this city. He rides off every day on his black bike with a sidecar for passengers.

He bikes past old buildings, billboards and an Internet cafe called Google. Shiny new apartment towers rise to the sky. They are signs of the changes in Yangon, the country's largest city. New white taxis run around the slow old buses, another sign of the modern times coming to Myanmar.

## From Military Rule To A New Democracy

Myanmar, which used to be called Burma, was a colony controlled by Britain until 1948. It was run by the military until 2011. The country's government is still developing as a democracy. Many countries and businesses avoided Myanmar when the military ran the government. Today, they are doing business there again and the country is modernizing.

But even in 2015, there is room on the road for the bicycle sidecar taxis. Buses are cheap, but they are hot, said Linn Naing. And the new taxis are cool, but they are expensive, he said. Linn Naing has been at his job for eight years. Business is still good. In fact, with all the traffic congestion today, it is often faster to take a sidecar, so many people prefer them, he said.

## Motorbike Ban Boosts The Sidecar Business

Cheap motorcycles and scooters have replaced the bicycles in many Asian cities, but the military does not allow motorbikes in Yangon.

Legend has it that motorbikes were banned after a motorcycle gang called the Scorpions cut in front of a general's car. But even as democracy grows, the ban has stayed in place.

That is good news for thousands of sidecar drivers in the city like Linn Naing. It costs just 20 cents to 50 cents for a trip, which makes sidecars cheaper than taxis for short trips.

Linn Naing takes women home from the market, takes children to school and transports tourists to temples. He makes about $10 a day. That is good pay in a country where the average person earns about $1,000 a year.

Still, getting into the business is not cheap. A bicycle and a sidecar can cost about $200, and a license costs $300.

Unlike many drivers, Linn Naing owns his sidecar. This means he does not have to pay $2 to $3 a day to rent a sidecar.

## Passengers Ride Back To Back

The design of the sidecars is about 85 years old. According to the story, a mechanic wanted to create a cheaper form of transportation than trains.

Burmese sidecars are made by hand out of wood. They have two seats, one facing forward and one facing the rear. Passengers sit back to back beside the driver. The sidecar is hooked to the bicycle frame. A bell and a light usually sit on the handlebars and a metal license plate flies like a flag over the front fender.

Zaw Zaw Co, a Yangon artist, has been putting the bicycles in his paintings since 2011. He shows the bikes floating above old maps of famous places around the country. He said he wanted to paint something that showed typical working people. Many drivers chose the work because they did not have much education and did not have many choices, he said.

Zaw Zaw Co likes sidecars because they are practical. They are useful to get home from the store or to go somewhere where buses don't go, like small streets, he said. The sidecars are here to stay, he said, because there will always be people who need them.
