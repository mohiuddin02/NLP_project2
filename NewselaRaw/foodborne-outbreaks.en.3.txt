WASHINGTON, D.C. â€“ Large outbreaks of illnesses caused by germs in food are becoming much more common in the United States. They are also becoming more deadly.

Salmonella, E. coli, and listeria are the three germs most often responsible for outbreaks. They can grow in food when it is not properly stored or handled.

An illness caused by germs in food sometimes only affects a few people. For example, it can be limited to the people who ate a particular dish in a single restaurant. Illnesses can also affect a large number of people.

Large outbreaks of illness happening in two or more states are known as multistate outbreaks. Such outbreaks are often particularly dangerous. The germs are usually much more deadly.

## All Kinds Of Food Cause Outbreaks

During the last 20 years, multistate outbreaks have become much more common. They are also bigger and deadlier than ever before. Together they were responsible for more than half of all deaths caused by germs in food from 2010 to 2014.

Multistate outbreaks have been caused by many kinds of food. Among them are vegetables, fresh fruits, beef and chicken.

Some foods had never been linked to outbreaks before. For example, caramel apples killed seven people and sent 34 to hospitals in late 2014. The apples turned out to be full of listeria germs.

## Chipotle Hit By E. Coli And Salmonella

Just last weekend, there was an outbreak of E. coli cases in Washington state and Oregon. The outbreak was linked to the Chipotle restaurant chain. No deaths have been reported, but eight people have been hospitalized. At least 22 cases have been reported across the two states.

Chipotle restaurants were also linked to an earlier outbreak in Minnesota. Tomatoes served by the restaurant contained salmonella. It sickened more than 60 people in August and September.

The restaurant chain's top bosses will soon meet with health officials. The goal is to figure out what has been causing the problem.

Salmonella caused most of the illnesses seen in newer multistate outbreaks. It was also the cause of the three largest outbreaks. In those cases, the salmonella was found in eggs, chicken and raw ground tuna.

## Listeria To Blame For Most Deaths

Listeria killed the most people, however. It was responsible for 57 of the 66 deaths from 2010 to 2104. In 2011 alone listeria in cantaloupe killed 33 people.

Eighteen of the multistate outbreaks were caused by foods imported from other countries. Foods from Mexico were the leading cause in those events. Mexican mangoes and papayas were the biggest problem.

The second most common cause was foods from Turkey. People were sickened by Turkish pine nuts, tahini and pomegranate seeds.

## New Rules And Tools To Make Food Safer

The government has just written a tough new set of food-safety rules. They cover the way food is grown, packaged, stored and prepared. If the rules are followed, food should become safer. Germs will not be able to grow and spread as easily.

Scientists also have new tools to help them quickly track down the cause of outbreaks. These tools allow them to easily spot a particular germ. Then they can link germs in sick people with the germs in bad food. By doing that, they can prove that a particular food caused an illness.

In a way it is like finding a germ's "fingerprint." Once a germ is identified, it can be linked to an outbreak of illness.

The new tools have allowed scientists to solve several old cases. They have been able to track down the food responsible for unsolved illnesses.

For example, last spring a wave of illnesses was traced to Blue Bell Creameries. Ice cream made by Bluebell turned out to have listeria in it. The bad ice cream was linked to illnesses and three deaths in Kansas and illnesses in Texas. Some of these previously unsolved cases went back as much as five years.
