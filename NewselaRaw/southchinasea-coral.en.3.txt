BEIJING â€” China already has a Great Wall that was built to keep out invading armies. Now, the country has been accused by the U.S. Navy of building a "Great Wall of sand." They are using sand to create man-made islands in the South China Sea. The government hopes the islands will help the country to become more powerful.

The United States believes the Chinese are digging up sand, collecting it and dumping it on reefs of living coral. This practice of building islands might have a serious impact on the environment and coral in the sea.

The South China Sea is a body of water that lies between China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei. The sea is home to many different types of underwater life. The reefs are very shallow and they attract fish. There are currently many reefs in the area, but without those reefs, the fish would disappear.

## Experts Say China Is Damaging Coral

Two experts from the University of Singapore, Youna Lyons and Wong Hiu Fung, have been studying China's actions. They say China has been collecting sand from the ocean floor, then using the crushed sand to make new land. The sand is placed on top of coral reefs. The dumping of sand can damage the underwater life that was there before. This process is called dredging. It is what allows the country to build the artificial islands.

Some people estimate that China has already created 1.5 square miles of man-made land. For many countries, more land can equal more power, which might explain why China wants to build the islands. The nations in the area are fighting for control of the South China Sea.

Building islands can give them more control. One challenge is that all the countries that border the South China Sea have a legal claim to the water. China says it owns almost the entire sea. While many countries are thirsty for control of the sea, they all want to avoid an armed confrontation with the others.

## Government Official: China Is Not Breaking The Law

Ouyang Yujing works for a Chinese government agency. He said China is not breaking the law by building the islands.

The islands can help China in many different ways. The islands become an area in the sea where citizens can work and serve China. The workers can perform different duties while they are on the islands. They can help lost boats or people at sea. They can also do science research, help ships navigate, fish, predict the weather and watch for pirates. The islands help China remain visible and strong in the area.

Yujing said the country did a lot of research before beginning to build the islands. Before any construction began, he said, the government conducted a "rigorous scientific test." The tests were designed to ensure there would be no environmental damage from the building.

"China's coral reef ecosystem has been under very severe impact," said Zhang Haiwen, who leads the Department of International Cooperation, another Chinese government agency.

## Many Sources Of Danger For Reefs

There are many reasons the reefs are in danger. Humans are responsible for some of the major changes. Acidification is a process that occurs when there is increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It is a big environmental problem that affects reefs and is common in China. China also blames fishing boats from neighboring countries for causing damage to the reefs. Haiwen said her agency is working on transplanting some reefs, and a government lab is developing techniques to regrow coral.

According to Haiwen, building artificial islands is normal in the international community. There are laws regarding island development. She claims China has been is compliance with both the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and its own tough regulations.

## Vietnam Has Also Done Dredging Projects

China is not alone. Haiwen said that some of China's neighboring countries are doing the same thing by using coral reefs to grow their land size. In fact, photos were recently released of two dredging projects in the South China Sea carried out by Vietnam.

When asked to describe the damage to the coral that China is causing, Zhang stood up in frustration.

"I have a plane to catch," she said, and walked out.
