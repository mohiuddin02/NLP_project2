WICHITA, Kan. — When Seth Ogden, 8, was in his grandparents' backyard when he was younger, his grandma asked him about the roses.

"I thought she was joking with me," Seth said. "Once I got closer, I could see the roses."

Seth is colorblind. People who have colorblindness have a hard time distinguishing the differences between certain shades of colors. It's not a serious condition. Kids who have colorblindness are usually born with it, having inherited it from their parents. 

Seth and his mom, who live in Wichita, Kansas, recently put together a YouTube video for a contest run by EnChroma. The company claims to have created glasses that can help people like Seth see color. 

## World Looks "Dull And Washed Out"

In the news release about Seth, an EnChroma employee described life with colorblindness like this: "To them, the world appears gray, dull and washed out. … In school, color-coded social studies maps and other information is a muddle of gray." 

His mom, Heidi, says this means Seth will mismatch clothes or confuse soccer jerseys. She worries that it's partly the reason he has never liked doing art.

Color vision activists refer to Seth's condition as "color vision deficiency" rather than colorblindness. People like Seth, they say, can see most primary colors, typically between 10,000 and 100,000 colors, while people with normal vision can make out 1 million colors. The world doesn't appear gray to Seth, but when colors are close together he struggles to tell the difference.

## Glasses Cost Hundreds Of Dollars

After Seth won the EnChroma contest, the company sent him a pair of its color-correcting glasses, which typically sell for hundreds of dollars.

Earlier this month he tried them on for the first time. 

"Whoa," he said immediately, with his parents looking on. Everything was golden, he said, as the sun shimmered through tree branches that had lost their leaves for the winter.

Seth and his mom first heard about the glasses by watching YouTube videos, some of which have hundreds of thousands of views. Many of the men in the videos went out to beautiful places in nature. They also cursed in surprise when they first tried on the glasses, so Seth's mom reminded him ahead of time that that wouldn't be necessary.

His parents asked if the greens looked greener. "A little bit," he said. "The sky looks a lot different."

## Seeing His Yard In A New Way

Although the sky was full of many colors at sunset, it was mostly blue. Seth shouldn't have trouble seeing that color without the glasses. He walked over to a bush behind his house, and Seth said excitedly that he could see berries on it that he'd never seen before.

Seth walked around his backyard, looking at grass and leaves, bird feeders and plant pots. At one point he picked up a dead leaf and saw speckles of red in it that he hadn't seen before. The dried leaves on the trees looked like clumps before but now looked distinct, he said.

His mom gently asked him whether he could see one color or another, and often he said he could, though not always. At one point Seth said that orange looked much brighter with the glasses on. His mom laughed and reminded him that the sunglasses make everything look a little darker.

"What color is the umbrella?" his parents asked.

"It's green, kind of a dark green," Seth said.

"What color does it look without the glasses?" they asked again.

"It still looks green," Seth said. He decided that he's just better at seeing green than red, regardless of whether he wears the glasses.

## Grandpa Not Impressed

When Seth's grandpa, who is also colorblind, found out about the glasses, he wasn't impressed. "I've been colorblind my whole life," he said.

Before heading back inside to finish homework and play video games, Seth said the glasses helped him distinguish colors but the colors didn't "show out" as much as he had expected.

"Does it make you wish you weren't colorblind in the first place so you didn't have to wear them?" his parents asked.

No, he said, this was "funner": Regular kids had always seen color and would never get to see colors for the first time this way.
