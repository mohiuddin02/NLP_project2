MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. â€” Google is building a new kind of car. The car runs all on its own. No one needs to drive it. You can just sit back. It will take you where you want to go.

The new cars are not ready for people to use. They are still not safe enough. They should be ready by 2020.

Brian Torcellini works for Google. He helps make driverless cars safer.

Brian rides in the cars. If something goes wrong he takes over. He is a very good driver.

## He Watches Out For Trouble

Most of the time Brian just sits and watches.

He started working for Google six years ago. He is one of about 100 drivers. Google now has 48 of the new cars.

The new cars mostly drive in California. They ride on streets with regular cars.

Each driverless car has two drivers in it.

One is there to drive if something goes wrong. The other writes down any problems that happen. Their reports help Google make the cars run better.

## Many People Are Bad Drivers

Riding in a driverless car is not always safe. The cars have been hit by other cars 16 times. So far no one has been badly hurt.

The driverless cars that were hit did not do anything wrong. Each time the problem was caused by the other car.

The drivers of the other cars were not looking at the road. They were too busy texting or talking on the phone.

Many people "aren't very good at driving," Brian said.

Google's driverless cars drive better than many people do. Someday they will be even safer, Brian said. They will be better than even the best driver.
