Could his car really drive on water?

Dave March was about to see.

It wasn't sitting on a road by other cars. It was in the water, next to his 65-foot boat.

He's been trying to build a car that can drive on water for years. He was looking at Catalina Island, off California's coast, where he was going to try to drive the car he made. He'd never tested the car on open water. If it didn't work, it was going to be a long swim back.

He was about to start selling the cars. And a lot of people want one. Sheik Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum, who is the Prince of Dubai, ordered six. Race car drivers want them. Many other rich people want the car too.

But first he needed to see if it works.

## Going Across The Water

March points the car in the water toward the island. He is surrounded by three powerboats carrying friends and family. He steps on a pedal. The car called the Panther slowly begins to move. The morning sun is still low, and the Panther cuts across the water.

March moves into deeper water. Land disappears from sight. Dolphins jump out of the water around him and a whale comes up for air. March's grin is so big you can see it from another boat.

His hands are strong and gnarled from working on cars and boats. His blonde hair falls by his gray-blue eyes. He has the smile of a man who has done well at what he tries.

He made his first water car in 2003. When he switched it into being a boat, the wheels went up into the car.

## No Match for Rocky Beaches

The Panther made it across the water to the harbor of Catalina Island. "I never thought we'd make it the first time out," March said. He celebrated with his friends and family.

March wanted to drive the Panther into town. But it is not designed to climb steep beaches. It's better on smooth sand. The rocky banks of Catalina were too much for it. March had to run the car backwards. It sent small rocks flying under the car, breaking a wheel fastener.

March was sad he was not able to finish the trip into Catalina. But he was glad to find a problem. It showed him how he could make the car better. March said he'd learned something. "That's what it's all about."
