### PRO: It's called representative government: Majority's stance should rule

President Barack Obama is once again faced with a problem of his own creation. After all, when you sow disgust you reap mistrust.

For seven years the president has dismissed, demeaned and denounced those who have raised legitimate concerns about his policies.

And when those concerns have turned out to be correct, as they often have — think "if you like your health care plan, you can keep it," Islamic State being "contained," the promise of a post-partisan America, and so on — he ignores the evidence, berates his critics, and asserts that everything is going well.

So when 31 governors turned their thumbs down on Obama's decision to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees and distribute them among the states, the governors were sending a message that said, "We do not trust you and your administration to tell the truth or do the due diligence necessary to vet refugees."

Let's be clear: Every governor knows this is a country of immigrants with a long and cherished tradition of helping refugees.

And they know that the vast majority of the refugees would be honest and law-abiding, thrilled to get a chance at a new start in America. But even a vast majority isn't 100 percent, and that presents a legitimate safety concern.

But Obama, true to form, dismissed the concerns and ridiculed the critics. "Apparently they (the Republicans) are scared of widows and orphans coming into the United States of America," the president sneered. He then claimed that the screening process would be the "most rigorous process conceivable."

Is that so? Remember Obama administration officials boasting how well the HealthCare.gov website would work right before its disastrous rollout? So what about refugee screening technology?

Under normal circumstances, elected officials and most of the public would take the president's word. But this president has misled the public so often that he hasn't earned the benefit of the doubt — and he isn't getting it.

The governors resisting the refugee resettlement simply don't trust Obama's claims of stringent security checks. And neither does the public. A Rasmussen poll showed some 60 percent of likely voters "oppose the settling of Syrian refugees in the state where they live." Even many elected Democrats are skeptical.

This same president keeps trying to relocate Guantanamo detainees stateside, assuring governors the prisoners are not a threat — even though more than 100 of them who have been released have rejoined jihadist groups.

Exacerbating the mistrust, the administration has resorted to making ludicrous statements.

For example, the State Department says that only 2 percent of Syrian refugees admitted to this country since 2011 are "military-age males." So what? Anyone watching the news can see that young and middle-age adult males make up a good portion of those currently fleeing Syria.

Even if the State Department restricted the 10,000 refugees to "widows and orphans," widows have brothers and orphans have uncles. Wouldn't there be a need to let other family members in, if not now, then soon, in order to help provide for the resettled women and children? And, of course, some women have been suicide bombers.

Here's the point: Those who are frustrated with the refugee stalemate need to focus their ire on the president, not the governors. Obama entered the White House determined to prove that big government can do big things well. Instead, he has increased Americans' long-held skepticism of big government.

Remember the IRS scandal? The Environmental Protection Agency polluting a Colorado river? The Veterans Affairs' health care scandal? And that "red line" in Syria?

I, for one, hope the administration, Congress and governors can find a solution that upholds the country's long tradition as a haven for refugees. The mistrust in this case isn't targeted so much at the Syrian refugees, but at the White House.

### CON: Some governors exaggerate terror threat by making U.S. seem weak

The U.S. governors refusing to accept Syrian refugees are not only morally wrong; they're helping the Islamic State extremist group.

The first thing we need to understand is that Islamic State is actually weak. It claims responsibility for any act of terror on Western soil so that it can seem stronger than it actually is.

Most attacks have actually been the acts of unaffiliated, do-it-yourself terrorists, but Islamic State fighters don't want us to know that. They want us to believe they're everywhere. They want us to fear them. They want us to get angry and vilify Muslims everywhere.

Islamic State's fighters believe that if they can make Muslims the enemy of the West, then millions of peaceful Muslims living around the world will join them.

Their goal is quite simple. They aim to divide us. They would like nothing more than to have the Western world embrace Donald Trump's idea for a Muslim database or ID patch. They want us to identify the world in terms of us vs. them. And they want us to turn away Syrian and other Muslim refugees who are fleeing their reign of terror.

Since 2011 when violence broke out in Syria, 11 million Syrians have fled their homes for safety, and more than 250,000 people have died.

This is the biggest refugee crisis since World War II, with Syrians now making up the world's largest refugee population. Most are struggling to find safe haven in Europe, and the U.S. needs to help.  

Thirty-one governors have protested the admission of Syrian refugees, going as far as to say that their states will refuse to take them in.

The refugee screening process in the U.S., however, is extremely difficult to get through. Most refugees stay in temporary camps for months to years while their personal stories are evaluated and checked.

About half of these refugees are children, another quarter are elderly. Almost all of the adults are either mothers or couples coming with children.

By protesting the acceptance of these war-torn refugees, these U.S. governors are not only going against our ideals as a nation, they're also helping the Islamic State by dividing us even further. They are helping Islamic State by showing that our leaders want to turn away these desperate families because it's us versus them.

The 31 irresponsible governors are also sending a message to the U.S. public that fear, xenophobia and even outright hate are validated. This ill-informed policy is not reflective of what is at the core of our national history. Every time reactionary U.S. leaders have followed similar paths in the past, their fears have been proven to be irrational and we as a nation have had to correct course.

Let us not forget what is inscribed on the Statue of Liberty, quite possibly America's most iconic symbol:

"Give me your tired, your poor,

Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,

The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.

Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me,

I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"

Can you honestly read that and feel we should reject these victims of the Islamic State?

Let's not accept this fear only to be proven wrong by history yet again. Instead, let's reject leaders, whether governors or members of Congress, who want to fan illogical fear. Let's educate ourselves about the plight of refugees and the significant hurdles they must clear. And let's light the way for a safer world by leading with an example of humanity.
