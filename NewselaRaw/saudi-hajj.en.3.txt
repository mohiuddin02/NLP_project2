MECCA, Saudi Arabia â€” Muslims from across the world poured Sunday into a sprawling tent city in the Saudi desert. It was the start of the yearly Islamic hajj, or religious journey, to this holy city. But the number of the pilgrims this year has been reduced. There are concerns about a virus in the region.

More than 2 million pilgrims left the holy city of Mecca. They went to a huge tent camp in Mina about three miles away. There were about 1 million fewer than last year. In Mina, they began preparations for the hajj with a day of prayer.

The Saudi government cut back on travel papers. The authorities did not give as many to old people, pregnant women and those with long-term illnesses. They were guarding against a new virus related to SARS. It has killed more than 50 people in the kingdom this past year. The Saudi health minister said late Saturday that no cases of the coronavirus infection have been detected among pilgrims.

Huge construction projects underway in Mecca also meant fewer people got permission to come to the area.

## "Here I Am, God"

The hajj is a central pillar of Islam. It is a four-day religious cleansing based on centuries of interpretation of the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad. Able-bodied Muslims must make it once in their lives.

Muslims traditionally visit the mosque where Muhammad is buried. It is in the city of Medina. They begin the hajj in Mecca at the Kaaba. It is a cube-shaped structure in the city's Grand Mosque that Muslims around the world face in prayer five times a day. Muslims circle the Kaaba counterclockwise with their hearts tilted toward it.

"Labayk Allahuma Labayk," or "Here I am, God, answering your call. Here I am," chant thousands of Muslims. Single voices become drowned in a sea of worshippers. They are all dressed in seamless white terrycloth robes and shoes. They are required to wear the simple outfit. It is meant to increase feelings of being unified, equal and humble.

The pilgrims headed on Monday from Mina to the area of Mount Arafat. It is near a hill called Jabal al-Rahman, meaning Mountain of Mercy.

## Protecting Against The Virus

Muslims believe the Prophet Muhammad gave an important lesson here. He called on people to end their fights and forget their differences. The mountain is about 12 miles east of Mecca. Muslims believe the gates of heaven are open for prayers to be answered at this time and place.

This year, some pilgrims are wearing masks. They are protecting themselves from the Middle East respiratory syndrome. It has sickened nearly 100 people, most of them in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East. The new virus is related to SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. SARS killed hundreds in a global outbreak in 2003. It belongs to a family of viruses that most often causes the common cold.

Saudi authorities cut the number of people who could come for the hajj by 20 percent. They were worried there could be an outbreak of the virus among the pilgrims. Ismail bin Mohammed runs the Health Department in Mecca. He said there were eight hospitals and 24 health centers set up at points along the journey.

In recent years, the hajj also has reflected the concerns of unrest and bloodshed across the Arab world. The civil war in Syria has claimed more than 100,000 lives. It has also sent millions of people fleeing across borders.

## Praying For An End To Bloodshed

"Syria is suffering and that means that the Arabs and the Muslims are also suffering," said Abdel-Karim Ahmed while in Mecca before heading to Mina. "I ask God ... to lift the suffering of the Syrian people and stop the bloodshed."

Similarly, Egyptian pilgrim Essam Hassouna said he is praying for his country. It saw its worst violence in August. More than 1,000 people were killed in clashes after the military ousted President Mohammed Morsi from power.

The hajj is an ancient practice. But there have been changes in how it is observed. Pilgrims are often seen using touch screen technology to read the Quran. The Grand Mosque in Mecca has also changed dramatically. It expanded to hold the growing number of pilgrims. The first part of the mosque's new growth project is estimated to hold 450,000 worshipers this hajj.
