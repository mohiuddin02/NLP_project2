CUPERTINO, Calif.  — Apple, trying to gain lost ground in a smartphone industry it once defined, unveiled two distinct versions of the latest iPhones Tuesday. One was cheaper and made of plastic. The other aims to be "the gold standard of smartphones" and reads your fingerprint.

Apple introduced the latest iPhone models during an event at its Cupertino, Calif., headquarters. The move comes as the company tries to catch up to Samsung while fending off other competitors that want to challenge Apple in the smartphone market. The lower-cost iPhone 5C is expected to help boost sales in China and other places where people don't have as much money to spend on new gadgets as they do in the U.S. and Europe. The phones will be available on Sept. 20.

Research firm Gartner Inc. estimates that Apple was No. 2 with a 14.4 percent share of the world's smartphone market in the second quarter of this year. Samsung led the industry with 31.7 percent.

The lower-cost iPhone 5C will be available in five colors — green, blue, yellow, pink and white. CEO Tim Cook calls it "more fun and colorful" than any other iPhone. The 5C has a 4-inch screen and is powered by Apple's A6 chip. The rear cover lights up.

## $99 Price Higher Than Expected

The iPhone 5C will cost $99 for a 16 gigabyte model and $199 for a 32 gigabyte model with a two-year wireless contract.

Jefferies analyst Peter Misek called the phones "lovely," but said in a note to investors that the $99 minimum price for the 5C is "is higher than expected and still leaves Apple" at a disadvantage in the lower cost part of the market.

Without a contract, the 5C costs $549 and $649 depending on memory size.

The second phone, the 5S, is "the most forward-looking phone we have ever created," said Phil Schiller, senior vice president of worldwide marketing at Apple. It will come in silver, gold and "space gray" and has a new chip, the A7 that is up to twice as fast as the A6.

Schiller said the new phone can run more health and fitness applications. These apps have become increasingly popular as more people use them to track exercise routines, calorie intake and even sleep patterns.

## 5S Model Can Read Fingerprints

The camera in the 5S received some major upgrades, including several automatic features designed to produce better photos. It can capture more light. The phone also has a "true-tone" flash feature that is designed not to clash with the colors in the room or a person's skin color. Schiller said this has not been done on a phone before.

The camera, called iSight, is designed to  help avoid blurry pictures. It also has a slow-motion camera for video. A "burst mode" can take 10 frames per second as long as you hold your finger on the shutter. Then it finds the best one to store.

The 5S also includes "Touch ID" which reads fingerprints at a "detailed level," Schiller said. The 5S learns about your fingerprint. Then you can just touch the home button to unlock the phone. The company said fingerprints will not be stored on Apple's computer servers.

Tying the fingerprint scanner to payments could also open new revenue channels for Apple.

Both models will be on sale on Sept. 20 in the U.S., Australia, China, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Singapore and the U.K.

## Free Download On Sept. 18

Apple said this is the first time that a new phone has been available right away in China. This is a sign of the growing importance of that market to the company. People will be able to order the 5C in advance on Friday, but not the 5S.

For buyers entering a two-year contract with a wireless carrier, the 5S will cost $199 for 16 gigabytes of memory, $299 for 32 and $399 for 64.

Apple also said its next mobile operating system, iOS 7, will be available as a free download on Sept. 18. The operating system manages how the phone works and how apps work on it.

The new system can be downloaded on the iPhone 4 and later models, as well as on the tablets beginning with the iPad 2.

Apple also said that it expects to ship its 700 millionth iOS device next month.

Apple CEO Tim Cook predicts that iOS 7 will become the most popular mobile operating system in the world. Investors seemed unimpressed. Apple's stock price fell $11.60, or 2.3 percent, to close Tuesday's trading at $494.58 per share.
