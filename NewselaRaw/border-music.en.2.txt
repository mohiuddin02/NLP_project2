SASABE, Ariz. — On a windy day in southern Arizona's remote borderlands, Glenn Weyant had everything he needed to make music — a cello bow and a mallet. But, he wasn't going to play a normal instrument. His instrument was the miles-long fence dividing the United States and Mexico.

His method, like his music, was on the fly and low-tech: He inserted electronic equipment into a tin can, turning it into a microphone. Weyant filled the tin with magnets and pressed it against the fence a few inches off the ground. Wires attached to the tin led to an amp to let him increase the volume.

Desert scrub, mesquite and sun-bleached rocks were his only audience.

"Nobody thought of the border wall as possibly anything other than something to separate people," he said.

## His Gig On The Border

Weyant says people view the fence with fear. He wants his music to spark conversation between people on both sides of the border wall.

The fence was built up to keep people from coming into the U.S. Often people try to enter the U.S. in search of better jobs — even if they aren't allowed to. Worries about terrorism have led to the fence getting built up even more.

For eight years, Weyant has tapped, banged and stroked the fence to produce haunting sounds in a region he has called a "militarized zone." His songs can last a minute — or more than half an hour.

Weyant, 50, moved to Tucson 19 years ago when much of the border fence in southern Arizona was barbed wire. It seemed forbidden. He didn't know whether he could even touch it.

Though people tend to stay away from the fence, it's not against the law to touch it.

The New Jersey native had been drawn to unusual sounds his whole life — as a boy he enjoyed listening to the hypnotic pattern of his grandfather's electric fan. One day in 2005 he decided that he wanted to hear what sounds the fence could make.

In Nogales, he played a fence made of re-used helicopter landing pads. He'd capture the noise from birds landing on top of the fence and the sounds of cars and people passing through the border checkpoint.

In Sasabe, he created a delicate raspy sound when he played his cello bow on rusty mattress wires. Ranchers had stretched the wires between fence posts to keep their cattle from straying into Mexico.

## Moans, Whistles And Clicks

Weyant is more interested in creating effects than melodies. His recordings can sound like wind chimes or have the flutelike breathiness created by blowing across a bottle top. Other sounds resemble moans, whistles and clicks.

People who have stumbled across Weyant sometimes looked on from afar, unsure of what he was doing. Others have approached him and stayed for a private concert.

For the most part, Border Patrol agents have left him alone.

"I'm a white male playing the border wall," Weyant said. He believes that's why he's allowed to keep playing.

Some agents have greeted him with friendly curiosity.

"Why are you playing a wall?" one asked.

Another radioed his superiors saying, "There's a guy playing the wall. Is he allowed to do that?"

A few agents have warned him about people on the southern side of the fence.

"Hey, you know they throw rocks," one told him.

"Usually," Weyant said, "when you play in a venue, you don't have people with guns watching you and one guy telling you that people on the other side want to hurt you." Still, he's never had any dangerous run-ins with people on either side of the fence.

## Haunted With Stories

Weyant, a former professor of journalism and now a stay-at-home dad, said he gets to the border often once a month. He has given lectures about his music at universities. Other musicians have added his border sounds into their own works. He sells his music. He's been posted on YouTube.

In recent years, people throughout southern Arizona have seen the buildup along the border. They've seen sections of the fence change from weak, thin structures to taller more permanent ones that dot the Sonoran Desert.

After the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, crews installed a fence near Sasabe made of solid steel columns set a few inches apart.

Few have heard the border change, but Weyant has. The sounds, like the fence itself, are often harsher than before.

Weyant said the border wall was an appropriate place to make music because it's haunted with stories.

"This section is where hundreds of people die," he said. "Did they come from Guatemala?"

Dusty handprints stood out against the rust of the fence near Sasabe. "Was it just a kid who jumped the fence? So many stories," Weyant said. "There's a lot of mojo here."
