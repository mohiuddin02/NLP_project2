Mathematician Eugenia Cheng had just cut a bagel into the strange one-sided shape known as a Mobius strip. She was explaining why a liquid could not take the same shape, when a student asked a question: "That bagel looks like water coming from a waterfall," Nico Camargo said. "What if you froze water?"

Cheng was delighted by the idea.

"A frozen Mobius strip," she said with excitement. "Why didn't I think of that?"

A grinning Camargo suggested that he had come up with the unusual idea because he is an art school student.

## Cool Combo: Art And Physics

Camargo attends the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC). More and more these days, his school is exploring the connections between art and science.

SAIC already had science and math classes, but the school is now offering a class that connects those subjects to art. Cheng had been invited to speak to a class full of art students.

The new class combines art and physics, a type of science that studies the nature of matter and energy.

The work at SAIC is just one example of a growing interest in combining science and art. The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the National Science Foundation held meetings in 2010 on how artists, scientists and technology experts can work together. The NEA has funded about 30 arts-science and arts-technology projects a year since 2011.

"Artists and scientists are both looking to advance understanding and meaning," said the NEA's Bill O'Brien.

## Looking For The Next Leonardo

The Rhode Island School of Design is another of the nation's best art schools. These days it is also trying to combine art with science, technology, engineering and mathematics.

At the Museum of Science and Industry, the Art of Science Learning project is developing ways to teach science by using art. The project first brought together scientists, artists, teachers and students in 2014.

In a way, all this is a return to old ways of thinking about science and the arts. The two were not always as separate as they are today. Through much of history, many artists were scientists as well. The combination is perfectly illustrated by Leonardo da Vinci, who was an inventor as well as being one of the most famous artists ever. Only within the last 200 years have science and art grown far apart.

SAIC's new efforts were begun by the school's president, Walter Massey, who is a physicist.

Massey was eager to explore the connections between science and art. He began holding teacher meetings that looked at the similarities in the ways artists and scientists see the world.

SAIC now has a scientist-in-residence program, through which a well-known scientist spends a period of time at the school. The first scientist was David Gondek, who helped develop a supercomputer that beat two champions on the "Jeopardy!" quiz show. Cheng, who teaches math at the school, is SAIC's second scientist-in-residence.

## Music, Math And Edible Pi

Cheng is not only a mathematician, but a concert pianist as well. For her, there is a strong connection between math and art. Both work with things that exist only as ideas, not as objects in the real world.

For Cheng, teaching at SAIC is just one way to bring mathematics to wider audiences. Her short math videos on YouTube have been viewed more than 800,000 times. Her new book, "How to Bake Pi: An Edible Exploration of the Mathematics of Mathematics," will be published in May.

Cheng does not expect SAIC students to master complicated mathematics. However, she said, they can still get a sense of the kinds of ideas that makes math so exciting for her.

"I always say you can appreciate listening to music even if you can't play it yourself," she said. The same is true of math, she feels.

Charles Shields is an art student who is taking Cheng's math class. He finds the ideas intriguing even if he cannot always do the computations, he said.

For one of his projects, Shields made a stained glass work that reads, "1 + 1 equals 1."

Cheng was startled at first, but in the end, she loved it.

"There are mathematical systems where 1 plus 1 does not equal 2," she said. "There are some in which it's zero."
