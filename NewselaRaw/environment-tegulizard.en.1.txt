MIAMI — At no longer than four feet, a tegu lizard can't gobble down a full-grown deer or alligator. But it may be a greater threat to South Florida's wildlife than a much larger reptile that can.

The tegu has the potential to cause even more ecological damage than an 18-foot-long Burmese python, which has drawn international media attention in recent years for eating large animals. And now, scientists say, it's too late to wipe the tegu out.

"When we first found out about them in 2008, we thought we had a chance to nip this population in the bud," said the National Park Service's Tony Pernas, who co-chairs the Everglades Cooperative Invasive Species Management Area group. "Now we've changed from eradication mode to containment mode."

The tegus probably were abandoned by irresponsible owners or escaped from breeding facilities in south Miami-Dade County. They have long been popular in the exotic pet trade of animals more commonly found in the wild. Right now, the escapees' home base is in the Florida City-Homestead area. There, federal, state and local agencies — with help from private trappers — are trying to round up as many tegu as possible before the animals go into hibernation in October.

## They'll Eat Just About Anything

A separate tegu population has cropped up in west-central Florida's Polk-Hillsborough County area.

The chief worry among scientists and wildlife managers is that the black-and-white tegus will spread out to neighboring Everglades National Park, where a handful of them have already been caught. The wildlife experts are also concerned that the lizards may wander east to Florida Power and Light's Turkey Point nuclear power plant, and south to the Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge in north Key Largo.

Containment is urgent, they say. The lizards will eat just about anything, including small mammals, birds, insects, plants, and their all-time favorite — eggs. That means goodbye to the baby American crocodiles that would have hatched in the refuge and on the grounds of the power plant. It could also mean lights out for the endangered Key Largo wood rat, not to mention other native creatures.

"They have the potential to impact all kinds of ([endangered](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species)) species," said Jenny Eckles, a wildlife biologist with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC). "Tegus can go through the water. They're very adaptable to a number of different habitats, which is why we consider them to be problematic."

Unlike Burmese pythons, which can't tolerate the cold, tegus thrive in temperatures as low as 35 degrees Fahrenheit, as well as in the steamy South Florida heat. Eckles and others, who track them, say they often find tegus out in the open during the hottest time of day.

The animals hibernate in burrows from October until about January or February, then emerge once again to search for food and reproduce. Females can lay 35 eggs a year.

## Eggs Make The Best Bait

Eckles and other scientists say they don't know the size of the tegu population  in south or west-central Florida. But their numbers definitely are on the rise. Pernas said trappers caught 13 tegus in 2009. This summer, researchers from several different agencies, including the National Park Service, ZooMiami and the South Florida Water Management District, captured more than 140 tegus. These were found mainly on public lands and were killed humanely, according to Eckles.

Citizen trappers have taken more than 300 from private lands, Eckles said. Unlike with Burmese pythons, people do not need a special permit to trap and keep tegus.

Tegus are easiest to trap using eggs as bait, according to Jake Edwards, a wildlife technician hired by FWC to capture the lizards. But they are not easy to catch. "It might be basking on the road. You might have about 10 seconds before it runs away," he said.

But neither Edwards nor Jeff Fobb, a trapper who also heads Miami-Dade Fire Rescue's Venom One unit, recommends grabbing a tegu by the hand. The lizard has needle-sharp teeth and claws.

"I'd rather get bit by a 10-foot snake than that guy right there," Fobb said, pointing to a two-footer he recently caught in someone's garage.

## Capture And Contain (And Sell Too)

South Florida's growing tegu population has spawned a new industry: trappers who sell them as pets.

Rodney Irwin, 59, of Homestead — a former yacht captain and demolition worker — began trapping tegus on private land for fun and profit about two years ago. He estimates he's taken between 800 and 1,000 tegus, selling most of them directly to customers on his website www.tegusonly.com for about $100 apiece. Irwin says he's working to benefit South Florida's ecosystem.

"This is a chance for me to make a difference," he said. "I can't do anything about the apes in Borneo, but I can do something about the natives in my hometown."

Asked whether he was concerned that the pets he sells may end up right back in the Everglades abandoned by their owners, Irwin responded that none of his customers are local. And, in any case, they could buy a tegu in a pet store. He said he shares his capture data with the scientists working to contain the spread of the lizards.

So far, there are no plans to restrict ownership of tegus, unlike pythons, according to Kristen Sommers, who heads the FWC's exotic species section.

Sommers said the FWC is still gathering information,  and trying to figure out the potential of tegus expanding even farther afield and what the impact of that would be. Within the next year, the agency will have enough data to be able to determine its next steps.

"We need to figure out what's going on with this," Sommers said.
