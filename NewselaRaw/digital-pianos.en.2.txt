Russian pianist Osip Nikiforov, 19, is recording a piano song by Chopin, but he's not capturing any of its sound. In what may be a revolution in experiencing music, the movements a pianist makes can be recorded and then replayed on a similar piano thousands of miles away.

A piano with a sensor on it records the information, or "data," of his performance â€” the movements when keys and foot pedals are pressed. Playing a piano creates thousands of bits of data. And when made digital, that data can be stored. It can then be shared on the Internet and even accurately replayed by a similar piano.

Nikiforov plays a Disklavier piano, made by Yamaha. It's owned by Stella Sick, a music professor at Hamline University in St. Paul, Minn.

"These pianos are fantastic teaching tools," said Nikiforov. "You can correct things based on just listening to yourself. While you could do that with any recording, this one is even closer." And it's more accurate, he says.

## Auditioning From Afar

Sick says Nikiforov could use the piano to audition, or try out, to get into another music school, saving travel and other costs. To promote Disklaviers, which cost $40,000 to $240,000, Yamaha has simplified Internet submission of recorded auditions.

Last year, the company created a cloud storage website. The site allows Disklavier performances to be uploaded and shared among 18 U.S. universities and 28 places for private auditions. The network is expected to grow this year to 50 universities and 40 to 50 audition sites.

Nikiforov has already benefited from Internet auditions. At age 13, he sent a recording from a Disklavier in Moscow to audition for an international music competition based in Minnesota. He won third place, and the experience brought him there to study.

Sick, also born in Russia, has a music doctorate from the University of Minnesota. But her teaching career has been altered by the technology.

She discovered that by listening to the Disklavier's playback and watching the accompanying video of the player's movements, she could help students correct their mistakes.

Sick does some work for Yamaha. She recently helped demonstrate the Disklavier for the music department staff at St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minn. The school is wrestling with a decision on whether to use it as a way to audition prospective music students.

## Measuring Movements

Disklaviers first became available in the U.S. in 1987. In those days, they recorded piano data on storage disks. They are getting another look from university music teachers now that they are Internet-capable. Disklaviers are also attractive because they don't require fast Internet speeds for uploads and downloads.

The Disklavier is a traditional piano. But, it has been wired with extremely precise sensors to measure the movement of its mechanical parts. For example, when a piano key is struck, it causes a hammer to strike a piano string. A Yamaha sensor can measure and record the speed of that hammer at 1,023 different levels, and stores the result as numbers in a computer. Those numbers can be used to reproduce that hammer speed on another Disklavier. The sound produced is practically the same to that of the original piano.

And, aside from the classroom teaching benefits, universities wonder if remote auditions will bring them students from all over.

Having a diverse group of students applying "is what schools ask us about," said George Litterst, a Massachusetts pianist who also works for Yamaha. "The more competitive schools want students auditioning from Asia and Europe. The music department chair at Wayne State College in Nebraska recently listened to a remote audition from a high school junior who lives in the Aleutian Islands (in Alaska)."

That's part of the discussion at St. Olaf.

## A Teaching Tool

"If somebody in China wanted to audition for St. Olaf, we could arrange for them to do the audition electronically, which would be much more cost-effective for the student," said Kent McWilliams, a St. Olaf music professor. "But we already draw students from other parts of the country and the world.'' Besides, he added: "We like to have students come to campus so we get a good sense of them, and they of us."

The University of Minnesota just purchased its first Disklavier. Alexander Braginsky, a professor of piano at the UM School of Music, sees it as a valuable teaching tool with uses that haven't been discovered yet.

Initially, it will be used to receive audition recordings for the 2015 International e-Piano Junior Competition to be held at UM. The university will also use it for teaching.

"When I play back a Disklavier recording, I can slow it down 50 percent or speed it up 25 percent without changing the key it's being played in," Braginsky said. "That helps piano students hear what I hear. The playback usually brings a whole lot of surprises."

But that's just the beginning, he said. "I have used one of these Disklaviers to do remote piano lessons between Minneapolis and New York, and between New York and Tokyo," he said. "The students enjoy it very much. I think the uses for music education are yet to be fully explored."
