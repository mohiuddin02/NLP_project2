LOS ANGELES, Calif. — Ed Kaminsky is a Los Angeles-area real estate agent. He helps people buy and sell homes. Lately, Kaminsky has been calling anyone he might know who has a connection with a Rams player or two.

Kaminsky said he has called the Rams' offices and players. He called people who work for the players and players that aren't on the team but that have relationships with Rams players.

The Rams are moving to Los Angeles from St. Louis. Kaminsky and other real estate agents want to help the dozens of players, coaches and team officials who will be looking for a place to live.

Kaminsky is one of only a few agents in town who specialize in working with professional athletes. He helps them find new places to live as they move from team to team. All are competing to get part of the big business that comes with the relocation of an entire NFL organization.

## Many People Will Need Agents' Help

There are 53 players on a team. Add in coaches and assistant coaches and there will be more than 100 people looking for homes, said real estate agent Kofi Nartey. "That's a lot of people looking for places."

Nartey's company will add employees just to work on moving the Rams. They will help players hire moving companies, have cars shipped across the country and research local schools, he said.

NFL owners approved the Rams move last week. Some agents started reaching out to their contacts long before then.

"It's all about relationships, said Ikem Chukumerije. He runs a real estate company. "If we don't have connections to a player but someone else does, they get the business."

## Most Players Will Rent, Not Buy

That business probably will not be worth much at the beginning. Real estate agents make the big money when people buy or sell. Most agree that Rams players are more likely to rent than buy.

Many players are on short-term contracts. NFL careers also are notoriously brief. They average a little over three years, according to the players union. If players have permanent homes in the St. Louis area or elsewhere, they may think twice about buying into the Los Angeles real estate market. This is especially true given how expensive Los Angeles is.

The middle home price in the Los Angeles area is $506,800\. That is more than three times the middle price of $160,000 in the St. Louis area, according to the National Association of Realtors.

Chukumerije worked with an NBA player. The player was renting a 4,200-square-foot home in Florida. He wanted to find something similar when he moved.

The player was paying $5,600 a month in Florida. A similar home would cost more than $12,000 in Brentwood, an expensive Los Angeles community. 

## One Sale Is All It Takes

Even the lowest-paid NFL players make a league-minimum salary of $435,000, so they can afford Los Angeles-area prices. Still, the agents probably will line up mostly rental arrangements.

An agent might get paid 2 percent to 3 percent of a rental they help arrange. Even on a $10,000-a-month rental, they would make just $2,400 a year. That is tiny compared with the hundreds of thousands an agent might make on the sale of a multimillion-dollar home.

Yet agents say it is worth the effort. They hope to build up relationships with players now to get their business later on.

An agent can arrange 10 rentals and not make much. However, Nartey said, "those lead to one sale that makes up for all of them." 

## Players Have Lots Of Choices

One big decision players will have to make is where to live in Southern California.

Agents named some areas popular with pro athletes. Manhattan Beach has beautiful beachfront property, and Calabasas has huge homes in secure, gated communities. Manhattan Beach is near both Los Angeles International Airport and where the team will play. 

Other areas could see interest from players, too.

For younger players, Chukumerije said, "I see them gravitating toward downtown LA and maybe Hollywood."

More than almost any other factor, agents said, players will decide where to live based on the location of the team's training facility. That is where they will go for daily practice.

NFL coaches are strict about players being on time at practices. Being even a few minutes late can cost a player hundreds in fines. The area's heavy traffic makes being late a real possibility.
