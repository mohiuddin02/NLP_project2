Ryan Bennett of Kansas City does not demand much from his television.

But he wants his sports.

Chiefs on Sundays, plus the Royals and Missouri football and basketball when his schedule allows. "I don't really watch anything live, except sports," Bennett said.

Viewers like Bennett are critical in the world of sports. They help pay for the rising costs of running a team or a college conference.

Bennett's cable company makes deals to carry ESPN and other networks that show sports. ESPN and other channels spend billions of dollars for the rights to broadcast professional and college sports.

That cost gets passed on to costumers — whether they like sports or not.

"Until I saw something about it recently, I had no idea how much," Bennett said.

## The Price For Sports

Cable customers paid more than $5 a month for ESPN in 2012, research firm SNL Kagan said. ESPN has nearly 100 million subscribers. It is by far the most expensive product on basic cable.

The deal may be reasonable to sports fans. You get a month's worth of America's best live sports lineup. It only costs about as much as one large frozen coffee drink at Starbucks. But if you do not watch those channels, you still have to pay.

Some have called it a sports tax on their cable bill. Sen. John McCain has introduced legislation that would allow consumers to pay only for the programs they want to watch. The idea would be to pick channels from a menu.

TNT received $1.21 per subscriber last year. For that, viewers got NBA playoff and NCAA men's basketball tournament games. But they also got full seasons of police dramas such as "Southland" and "Rizzoli &amp; Isles." Other channels cost even less. News station CNN received 57 cents and the Cartoon Network 20 cents.

The average monthly basic cable bill was about $90 in 2012.

ESPN was in 98.9 million households in 2012. It is one of the most seen cable networks. It took in more than $6 billion in yearly subscriber fees.

Huge salaries for professional athletes and college coaches have increased as well as broadcast fees. Some of the costs make their way down to subscribers — sports fans or not.

DirecTV is making new costumers pay extra in markets with more than one area sports channel.

Time Warner viewers in Southern California probably will see their bills go up, too. The cable company is going to pay $7 billion to broadcast Los Angeles Dodgers games.

## Hard To Skip Commercials

The nine most-watched shows of 2012 involved live sports. And sports is real-time TV that is sought by advertisers because it is harder to skip commercials.

But A.J. Maestas, president of Navigate Research, said it all goes back to your cable bill. "People will switch their cable carrier if they don't have what they want," Maestas said.

Another sports network is on the way. Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. is launching Fox Sports 1, a national sports network to challenge ESPN. Fox Sports 2 is in the works. Comcast and CBS also have sports networks.

All are angling for cable dollars, whether you want sports channels or not.

McCain, an Arizona Republican, wants to change that. He wants to give cable television consumers the ability to pay as they go.

Cable companies do not want this. They like to sell popular channels like ESPN together with less desirable ones.

A growing trend — cord-cutting — could give the consumer the final word.

About 4.7 million American households that previously paid for TV will dump cable by the end of the year. They get their entertainment from the Internet using services such as Netflix, iTunes and Hulu. That's up from about 3.74 million in 2012 who cut the cord.

Maestas tried cutting the cord himself last fall. It didn't last. "I had to have my Washington Huskies," he said.
