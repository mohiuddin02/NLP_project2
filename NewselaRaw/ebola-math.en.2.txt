Past Ebola outbreaks have consistently "burned out" in relatively isolated and rural areas in Central Africa. Sick patients did not come into contact with many people.

Without new patients to infect, the virus eventually had nowhere to go. The current outbreak in West Africa, however, is taking place where several countries' borders meet. This has helped this outbreak boom into a disease that has a global reach.

What will it take to quash the ongoing Ebola outbreak? New studies suggest at least 50 percent — and perhaps 70 percent — of all contagious Ebola patients in West Africa would need to be isolated and kept from infecting others.

Those figures come from two new mathematical forecasts. One is by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), while another was published by Eurosurveillance, a magazine about diseases.

## Containing The Outbreak

If that level of containment is not reached, the outbreak could still be reduced but it won't be wiped out. It may continue to spread, perhaps for years.

Right now every sick patient with Ebola during this outbreak typically makes about two more people ill. The World Health Organization (WHO) tally suggests there are 7,178 cases of Ebola and 3,338 deaths so far.

Forecasts from the WHO and the CDC suggest that the death toll could soon climb to the tens of thousands. That's unless efforts to contain the outbreak are substantially increased.

In a worst-case scenario the CDC projected that by mid-January, Sierra Leone and Liberia alone could have up to 1.4 million cases. But that figure could be avoided.

The massive increase in aid provided by international forces could reduce that number.

The virus will not be contained, though, unless half of contagious patients are isolated. Smaller efforts will buy communities some time to scale-up their hospitals, though. They will also buy them time to, perhaps, develop a vaccine.

## Time Is Of The Essence

Yet the longer the response takes, the higher the chance that areas that are now Ebola-free could flare up again.

"This is also about how long it takes to stop the disease," says Alessandro Vespignani, a professor. He has been working on Ebola forecasting at Northeastern University.

"If it's a more minimal response and it takes nine months, that means more deaths, many more hiccups along the way and the cases in the region could spin out of control," he said.

The incubation period for the disease can last from two to 21 days. Only then do people develop symptoms and become contagious. And it's clear that the disease can be contained. Senegal and Nigeria appear to have stopped the spread of Ebola.

But other factors could worsen the threat if the disease is not completely contained soon. No one has studied how long people who recover from Ebola stay immune. It's possible that recovered patients may get ill again next year.

It's undeniable that Ebola is a scary virus. But it is not as readily passed between people as some other viruses.

## Calculations And Conclusions

The 1918 Spanish flu that killed more than 30 million people worldwide reportedly had a reproductive rate between two and five. Each ill person infected between two and five people, says Gerardo Chowell, a mathematical epidemiologist at Arizona State University. How many were infected depended on the location and environment.

Chowell produced the first Ebola forecasts in 2004. He calculated past Ebola reproductive rates from outbreaks in Central Africa. He concluded those outbreaks led to an average of 1.3 to 1.8 secondary cases.

In September, Chowell published his calculations in Eurosurveillance. They suggest the reproductive rate has not changed much between those historical cases and this outbreak in West Africa.

Chowell's estimate that 50 percent of contagious patients need to be isolated is lower than the CDC's estimate. In its findings, the CDC reported that perhaps 70 percent of patients would need to be placed in Ebola treatment centers or otherwise isolated to alter the course of the outbreak.

The second case of Ebola diagnosed in the U.S. recently only underscores the global threat of the virus and how vital it is to contain it.

"We can't make the risk zero until the outbreak is controlled in West Africa," CDC Director Tom Frieden says.
