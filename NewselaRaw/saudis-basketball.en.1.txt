JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia — As the National Basketball Association (NBA) tips off its season in the United States, a group of women and girls in Saudi Arabia will be chasing their own hoop dreams.

Women's basketball is becoming popular in a kingdom that has strict rules about what women are allowed to do. Now, women are using basketball to push for greater rights on and off the courts in Saudi Arabia.

"We are an activist team," said Lina Almaeena, who started the first women's basketball team here 11 years ago. In 2006, Jiddah United became the first sports club in Saudi Arabia to include women. "We took it upon ourselves to really promote the sport at a time when it was a big time taboo."

## An Act Of Defiance

For the players, basketball is not merely a sport. It's also an act of defiance in a country where female access to exercise is shunned by ultraconservatives. Physical education is still not taught to girls in Saudi public schools.

Women are bound by strict rules when it comes to what they wear. They cannot be seen by men while jogging in sweat pants, much less wearing fitted or revealing shorts. Most women in Saudi Arabia cover their hair and face with a veil known as the niqab and all women are required to wear a loose black dress known as the abaya in public.

Nevertheless, Saudi women's basketball is on the rise. Women from the ultraconservative kingdom are even playing in other Arab countries. Hadeer Sadagah, 20, started playing eight years ago with Almaeena at Jiddah United. She now plays at the college level for the University of Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates.

"I wouldn't be the person I am today without the sport and the team," she said. "It made me be more active in society, school and in studies. It made me more social. It made me confident."

At a recent afternoon basketball practice in Jiddah, girls as young as 4 years old jumped, took shots and ran on open-air basketball courts behind gated concrete walls. Boys played in nearby courts. The children and their coaches stopped for daily prayers.

## Male Coaches Can't Attend Games

Almaeena says basketball is becoming popular among Saudi girls because it offers the camaraderie of a team sport. Basketball is also seen as more acceptable by society. The girls can practice in loose, traditional clothes, and the sport can be played indoors and outdoors.

The sport has grown into a network of teams in different cities. No formal league exists but women's teams play in privately organized tournaments against a handful of other private schools, universities and club teams.

Despite the growth, women's basketball in Saudi Arabia still faces a host of logistical obstacles. For one, the kingdom has rules about keeping men and women apart.

Women's teams are not part of the kingdom's federation that oversees sports. Women often struggle to find facilities to train and are not allowed to attend matches in stadiums. In Jiddah, the older female players practice and play in a female-only gym. They only play tournaments in front of other women, and even their male coaches do not attend games.

It wasn't until 2012 that Saudi Arabia sent its first female athletes to the Olympics — exactly two of them. But two years later for the 2014 Asian Games, the kingdom went back to its tradition of sending only men.

## "Immoral" Track Suits

Almaeena's team generated some negative publicity in 2009 after they played a tournament in Jordan. The players were not wearing their abayas and photographs of them in modest track suits landed in local newspapers. They were labeled "immoral" and "satanic," Almaeena said.

It makes sense that Jiddah would become the birthplace for women's basketball in Saudi Arabia. The coastal city is easily the country's most liberal and worldly. Jiddah's residents are a melting pot of ethnicities whose ancestors settled along an ancient trade route. The result has been a distinct and more open culture than Saudi cities like the capital, Riyadh.

"Jiddah is where women are most physically active in society," said Sadagah, the Jiddah-born player in Sharjah.

Jiddah created public spaces where women and young girls briskly stroll alongside men in sporty black robes. It is an unusual sight in a kingdom where women exercising is largely a private activity.

## Sneakers And A Chauffeur

However, even in Jiddah it is mostly rich women who play sports.

Joining a club like Jiddah United costs around 600 riyals ($130) a month. Getting to a gym or sports club also requires paying for a driver, or chauffeur, because women are not allowed to drive in Saudi Arabia.

For now, women's basketball remains a fringe phenomenon in Saudi Arabia. But for enthusiastic players and their parents, its presence is a much-welcome source of both exercise and confidence-building life lessons.

Alaa AlShuwayer, a pharmacist and mother to two young girls, recently checked out a basketball practice with Abdul Salam in Jiddah. She was considering enrolling her daughters.

"I know 100 percent there's nothing wrong with girls or boys playing sports," she said. "I'd rather they play sports than buy them dresses and earrings."
