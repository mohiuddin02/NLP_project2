LONDON, England — Nadiya Hussain has become famous in England for her baking skills. She is the latest winner of the "The Great British Bake Off," a televised baking contest for amateur pastry chefs. Hussain has also become a popular symbol of British immigrant communities.

Hussain won out over two other finalists on Wednesday night to take the crown. The show was watched by 13.4 million people, a fifth of the British population. <img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/Britain_Baking_Sensat_Edit.jpg" />

Hussain lives in a city in northern England called Leeds, is a 30-year-old student, and is the mother of three children. She is also an immigrant from Bangladesh and a practicing Muslim.

Hussain said on Thursday that winning the show was "one of the best moments of my life."

She called the cake that won the competition her "big fat British wedding cake." She said she wanted to make it because she did not have a wedding cake when she got married in Bangladesh 10 years ago.

## Building A Following Through Hits And Misses

Millions of fans followed Hussain's progress through the series, reacting strongly to each of her successes and failures. Her victory on Wednesday was widely celebrated.

For many, Hussain is not just a baker on television. She also represents the face of modern Britain. In recent years, more and more immigrants have become part of the British population. As a result, British culture has become more varied, even as many British traditions continue to be passed on.

Since it first aired in 2010, "Bake Off" has been reflecting these changes. The show is old-fashioned, in a sense. The show features traditional British treats, but the chefs who cook up those treats are gay and straight, male and female, and from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds. They represent the modern mix of the British population.

One fan of "Bake Off" is David Cameron, Britain's Prime Minister. In a speech on Wednesday, he predicted that Hussain would win, and he called Britain the "proudest multi-racial democracy on Earth."

## Brits Offer Mixed Reception To Incoming Wave Of Immigrants

Not everyone in Britain is happy that so many immigrants are coming to the country, however. In the last decade, hundreds of thousands of newcomers have arrived from all over the world. They have not always been warmly welcomed.

For example, an anti-immigrant political party known as the U.K. Independence Party has gained millions of votes in local and national elections. The party's popularity is a sign that many view the number of immigrants entering England as a problem. This week, a government minister named Theresa May gave a speech in which she said that more immigrants would make society less unified.

Muslim immigrants are often singled out. Certain extreme Muslim groups have committed large-scale violence in recent years. As a result, Britain's 2.7 million Muslims are viewed with suspicion by some, even though the vast majority of Muslims worldwide are peaceful.

## Muslims Beaming About Baking Champion's Success

As a Muslim immigrant and Britain's new "Bake Off" champion, Hussain has made her community proud. The Muslim Association of Britain said her victory "has demonstrated the connection that young British Muslims have with British society."

It is somewhat surprising that slightly hokey "Bake Off" has become such a cultural sensation. The amateur chefs on the show toil over baking challenges in a large tent on the lawn of an elegant country house. Their cakes and treats are then judged by cookbook writer Mary Berry and master baker Paul Hollywood.

Two hosts, Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc, add encouragement and humor. The show is positive and cheery, with little of the drama found on so many other television programs.

## From Humble Beginning To Media Blockbuster

"Bake Off" had a modest start. In the first season, about 3 million viewers tuned in. Now, in its fifth season, the show has become immensely popular, drawing an average of 10 million viewers. Every week, it is the subject of conversation on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Sales of baking books and cake pans have soared as a result of the show's popularity. The format has even been copied in other countries, including Australia, Sweden, Turkey, France and the United States.

Josh Abrams studies and teaches about food and performance at London's Roehampton University. He described "Bake Off" as perfect for "an age when we're all digitized and spending so much of our time in front of screens." He thinks the old-fashioned tone of the show is refreshing for people.

"The idea of getting your hands dirty — whether physically in the dirt of your back yard or mixing things in a kitchen," reminds people of a simpler time, he said.
