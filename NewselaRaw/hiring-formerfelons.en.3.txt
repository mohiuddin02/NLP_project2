WASHINGTON, D.C. â€” Looking for work is difficult for many people. They have to fill out a job application. It asks many questions. One group of people has an even harder time finding a job. People who have been in prison often get asked tough questions about prison. Businesses do not give them the chance to talk about their skills.

Vivian Nixon is one of those people. She was convicted on charges of faking important papers and theft. She went to prison. After she was released, Nixon started to look for a job. She often went on three interviews a week.

During those interviews, the bosses did not ask Nixon about her skills. Instead they asked about life in prison. They wondered what she did and if she lived with dangerous people. They even asked if prison was anything like on television shows. The questions embarrassed Nixon. Even worse, no one gave her a job. She looked for over a year. Finally she was hired by a hospital in New York.

## Interview Rule For Former Inmates

Now President Barack Obama wants to do something to help people like Nixon. He is making a rule to help people who apply for jobs with the government. Bosses will not be allowed to ask former prisoners about their time in prison at the beginning of a job interview. They can only be asked after they have had time to talk about their skills.

Obama says people who made mistakes in the past should have a chance to have a better future. They could still be hard workers.

## Fair Chance And Federal Law

When people fill out a job application, they must check a box if they have a criminal record. Many state and city governments have already gotten rid of the box. Some large companies have, too. Target is one of those companies.

Lawmakers in Washington want to pass a ban-the-box law. It would be called the Fair Chance Act. Under that law, people applying for government jobs could not be asked if they had a criminal history at first. They could only be asked about it after they were offered a job.

## Breaking The Prison Cycle

Lately some Americans are changing their minds about prisoners. Now they want to help people after they get out of prison. Before, companies were nervous about hiring people with criminal records. One lawmaker in Washington even tried to make it against the law for prisoners who had committed serious crimes to go door-to-door and collect information for a government agency called the Census Bureau. Now people are working toward improving the lives of former prisoners. They want to help them get jobs so they can lead good lives. Then, they will be less likely to carry out crimes and go back to prison.

A new law could help the 65 million Americans with criminal records, said Glenn E. Martin. He started JustLeadershipUSA. His group works to lower the number of people in prison.

People of color are more likely than white Americans to go to prison. Therefore, they are also more likely to face discrimination for having criminal records, Martin added.

Obama says criminal records should be considered. However, he says everyone deserves a chance to get through the door first.
