There are lots of things that are good for your brain. Reading, for example, helps your brain to grow and work better. Solving puzzles can help, too.

Scientists now know of another way of keeping your brain healthy: exercising.

Scientists have shown that exercise helps the brain to grow. It also helps the brain stay healthy as people get older.

Babies need exercise for their brains to fully grow. Meanwhile, exercise improves children's attention and helps them do better at school. In the elderly, exercise can help to keep their minds sharp.

## The Brain's Link To Exercise

Scientists have known of the link between exercise and the brain for many years. In the mid-1990s, Carl Cotman showed that exercise helps the brain grow.

Cotman wanted to understand if exercise helped the brain. He studied the brains of mice. He gave wheels to some mice so that they could exercise. Later, he looked at their brains. It seemed that exercise helped the brains to grow.

Over the past 20 years, scientists have kept studying exercise. Lise Eliot studies the brain. She says that exercise is just as important for the brain as it is for the body.

Charles Hillman agrees. He studies the human body, exercise and health. He said that exercise can help the brain in many ways.

For example, exercise can help your brain talk to itself. The brain needs neurotransmitters to send messages from one part of the brain to another.

Exercise also improves blood flow to the brain. The brain needs oxygen from blood. Without oxygen, the brain would stop working.

## The Baby Brain Workout

Babies do not have to try to exercise. They are almost always moving. They get a lot of exercise. Their brains also get a workout. Mastering new skills like sitting, standing, walking, running and jumping forces their brains to grow.

As children get older, exercise is still important for the brain. Hillman did an experiment. He found groups of children between 7 and 9 years old. One group exercised for an hour after school. The other group did not. Hillman then gave both groups a number of brain tests. The kids who had exercised were able to learn more quickly than those who did not exercise.

Finally, exercise helps adults think quickly. Parts of the brain get smaller as people get older. This can make it harder for old people to remember things.

Scientists have found that exercise can keep the brain from changing too much in old age. For example, grown-ups who said they exercised for 30 minutes, five times a week did better on brain tests than grown-ups who did not exercise as much.

Studies also suggested that exercise can help fight Alzheimer's disease. Alzeimer's disease attacks the brain. It causes people to lose their memories.

At all ages, people who exercised did better on brain tests.
