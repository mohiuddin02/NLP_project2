NEW YORK — Outside the Metropolitan Opera in New York City on a recent frigid night, Ukrainian activists shivered on the sidewalk. They waved banners reading "GERGIEV supports WAR in UKRAINE" and "DON'T PLAY PUTIN'S TUNE."

The activists were there to protest Valery Gergiev, who had conducted Tchaikovsky's "Iolanta" and Bartok's "Bluebeard's Castle" that night.

Gergiev is perhaps the most prominent Russian artist of our time, but he has also become the most controversial because of his support for Russian President Vladimir Putin's policies in Ukraine and Crimea.

Putin has led an aggressive foreign policy, with Russian troops allegedly moving into parts of eastern Ukraine as pro-Russia separatists battle Ukrainian forces.

## Greeted By Protesters

Gergiev's long-standing friendship with the Russian president has led to some artists refusing to perform with him, and a festival in Germany banning him. Still, Gergiev insists that he is a busy musician with no time for politics.

Gergiev is busy. In Russia, he leads the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg along with the White Nights and Russian Easter festivals and the International Tchaikovsky Competition. Elsewhere, Gergiev is finishing his time as music director of the London Symphony Orchestra and moving to the Munich Philharmonic. He has yet more festivals — in Finland, Sweden, Holland, Israel and China and he guest-conducts other orchestras frequently.

Last week, Gergiev finished a month in the United States, which included opera, ballet and orchestral performances with the Mariinsky in New York, Florida and Michigan as well as guest conducting at the Metropolitan Opera.

Wherever he went he was greeted by protesters, including one who managed to reach the stage of the Met with a banner when Russian singer Anna Netrebko, who starred in "Iolanta" and who has also been a vocal Putin supporter, was taking her final bow.

Gergiev says he is fine with protesters expressing their opinions outside, but that it's not appropriate inside the theater.

"People come to hear music," he says, "not to hear shouting. And to go on stage and scare Netrebko, how can the Met let this happen?"

## A Daring Choice

In 1990, Gergiev had just turned 37. At the time, he was in his second season as artistic director of the Kirov (the Mariinsky's previous, Soviet name). While we refer to the Eastern European country as "Russia" now, it used to go by a different name. The Soviet Union contained several countries that have since separated from Russia, including Ukraine.

When Gergiev was chosen to be a director, it was a surprising and daring choice for the theater. At the time, Gergiev was unknown and only an assistant conductor.

But he had a grand vision. The Soviet Union had collapsed and the Soviet system had just ended. The new director was obsessed with thoroughly re-evaluating Russian culture. Russia, he said at the time, needed to know itself to become a meaningful new nation. As part of that, he intended to return the Kirov to its former glory.

He began to revisit operas that had been forgotten during the Soviet era. He focused on the works of Russian composers such as Prokofiev, Shostakovich, Mussorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakov and Tchaikovsky.

Gergiev accomplished his initial goals and much more, including building a concert hall for the Mariinsky Orchestra and a second opera house. He became an international ambassador for Russian culture. He had help — support from the Russian government.

"All the major cultural institutions in Russia need state support," Gergiev explained.

## Promoting The Environment

In St. Petersburg, he found a friend in city government — an assistant mayor who was active in supporting culture, future President Putin.

Putin is willing to use his office to support the fine arts. When other world leaders visit, he almost always takes them to the ballet and the Hermitage.

Along with promoting Russian culture, Gergiev has also become an advocate for the environment. In the early 1990s, Gergiev started a small festival in Mikkeli, Finland. In the Finnish forests he discovered lakes where the water is clean enough to drink.

"It was unthinkable in Russia that any lake be full of drinkable water," he marvels, "or trees be healthy or the air clean."

He added, "It was a learning process, of course." Gergiev worked with his conductor friend Esa-Pekka Salonen to start the Baltic Sea Festival in Stockholm to promote environmental issues. Gergiev was one of the first prominent figures in Russia to push for environmental reform.

## "It's A Long Story"

Gergiev argues that it is an artist's responsibility to provide humanitarian support whenever possible. He has appeared at hot spots around the world to perform charity concerts.

Still, international anger toward Gergiev has been building as Putin becomes increasingly unpopular in Europe and the U.S. When Gergiev approved of the Russian annexation of Crimea last year, many saw it as the last straw.

"It's a long story," he says, explaining that people outside of the region have trouble appreciating how deep-rooted the issues are. For this, Gergiev says you have to go back to the history of Ukraine and its relationship to Russian culture.

"The Crimea issue is not something from five years ago or three years ago. You have to go back 200 years, 100 years," he says.
