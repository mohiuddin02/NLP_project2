NAIROBI, Kenya — Some Vietnamese businessmen are celebrating with their new American partners. "A toast!" someone says. They raise their glasses to toast their new business. 

The drinks are sprinkled with a fine powder. 

## Disappearing Elephants And Rhinos

The powder is not gold. No, this is something far rarer and costlier. It is crushed white rhinoceros horn.

Fifty years ago, white rhinos were common in Africa. Today, only around 25,000 still roam the continent. 

The number of elephants left is also dropping quickly. Fifty years ago there were between 10 and 20 million elephants in Africa. Today there are just 470,000. 

Elephants are hunted for their hornlike tusks. Also known as ivory, tusks are actually long, pointed teeth. They are carved into a wide range of goods.

## Paying Poachers For Ivory

Both ivory and rhino horn are very popular in Asia. As a result, prices for both have soared. Elephant ivory now sells for around $1,500 a pound. Rhino horn costs $45,000 or more. 

Both animals are supposed to be protected. However, prices have gotten so high they are hunted anyway. 

Such unlawful killing is known as poaching. In Africa, poachers and people who help them make $20 billion a year.

Around 50,000 elephants were poached in 2013. There are now only about 50,000 left in all of Central Africa. 

Farther east in Tanzania, the number of elephants dropped by two-thirds from 2009 to 2014. Altogether, more than 25,000 were killed.

## Killing Gets Worse 

In Mozambique four out of every 10 elephants were killed from 2009 to 2014. All of Mozambique's white rhinos have already been wiped out.

Poaching has become a kind of warfare. Gangs of poachers carry rifles. Sometimes they even use planes. 

The killing is getting much worse. In 2007, only 13 rhinos were killed in South Africa. Last year, poachers there killed 1,215. South African rhinos may soon die out completely.

It has become much harder to protect endangered African animals. They are no longer safe even within wildlife sanctuaries. Such sanctuaries were set up to keep the animals safe from hunters. Nonetheless, poachers sneak in.

Kenya's Ol Pejeta sanctuary is home to 133 rhinos. Guards must watch over it 24 hours a day. There is no other way to keep poachers out.

## Some Good News

There is some good news, though. Last month, the Chinese and U.S. governments said they would outlaw the sale of ivory in their countries. China is the world's largest buyer of ivory. 

Things are also getting better in parts of Africa. In Kenya, rhino poaching fell by nearly half last year. Fewer of the country's elephants are being killed as well. 

Some of Kenya's animal sanctuaries have been trying something new. They used to try to keep people out of the sanctuaries completely. Now they are letting some people in. 

For example, Ol Pejeta now lets herders use sanctuary land. The herders graze their cattle inside the sanctuary. In exchange, they must report poachers in the area.

## Refuse To Buy Ivory!

The new approach is working. Ol Pejeta has not lost an elephant in many years. Only a very few rhinos have been killed.

All of this is good news, of course. However, something else must happen if rhinos and elephants are to be saved. The demand for horns and ivory must fall.

Each of us can help bring about that change. First, we must refuse to buy anything made out of ivory or rhino horn. Second, we must not take such things if they are offered to us. 

Only when people no longer want ivory and rhino horn will poaching die out. Meanwhile, elephants and rhinos are disappearing quickly. There is no time to waste.
