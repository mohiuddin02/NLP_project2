You may want to hold your nose before reading this: Doctors have found a way to put healthy people's poop into pills — and these pills are now being used to cure serious gut infections. Canadian researchers tried this method on 27 patients and cured them all. And this was after strong antibiotics —  medicines designed to kill harmful bacteria — had failed to help.

It's a gross topic but a serious problem. Half a million Americans get Clostridium difficile, or C-diff, infections each year, and about 14,000 die. The germ causes upset stomachs, cramping and extremely severe diarrhea. A very strong and expensive antibiotic can kill C-diff, but it also destroys good bacteria that live in the gut and help keep us healthy. This makes future infections more likely.

Recently, studies have shown that fecal transplants — in which infected people are given poop from a healthy person — can restore the good bacteria. And this in turn helps prevent reinfection.

But the methods doctors have been using are expensive and uncomfortable. These include colonoscopies, in which a tube is inserted far up the rear end, and using throat tubes. Doctors also have tried using enemas — that is, pumping the poop up the rear in liquid form — but this treatment doesn't always work.

## A Three-Legged Stool Treatment

Now Dr. Thomas Louie of the University of Calgary has come up with a better way: a one-time treatment custom-made for each patient.

Healthy poop, usually from a relative, is processed in the lab to take out the good bacteria. The bacteria is cleaned, then packed into gel capsules. These are triple-coated to prevent them from dissolving before they reach the intestines.

There's no poop left, just bacteria, Louie said. "These people are not eating poop." And there are no smelly burps because the contents aren't released until they're well past the stomach.

Days before starting the treatment, patients are given an antibiotic to kill the C-diff. On the morning of the treatment, they have an enema to clean out their gut. That way, Louie said, "the new bacteria coming in have a clean slate."

It takes 24 to 34 capsules to fit the bacteria needed for a treatment, and patients down them in one sitting. The pills make their way to the large intestine, or colon, and seed it with normal bacteria.

## Kudos For Louie's Novel Approach

On Thursday, at a medical conference in San Francisco, Louie described 27 patients treated this way. All had suffered at least four C-diff infections, but none got sick again after taking the poop pills.

Margaret Corbin, 69, a retired nurse's aide from Calgary, had a C-diff infection that lasted for two years.

"It was horrible," she said. "I thought I was dying. I couldn't eat. Every time I ate anything or drank water I was into the bathroom. I never went anywhere, I stayed home all the time."

With her daughter as the donor, she took pills made by Louie two years ago. "I've been perfectly fine since," Corbin said.

Dr. Curtis Donskey of the Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center, who has done fecal transplants through colonoscopies, praised the work.

"The approach that Dr. Louie has is completely novel — no one else has done this," he said. Donskey believes "this type of preparation will make these procedures much easier for patients and for physicians."

## Isolating The "Fighting Bacteria"

Right now, Louie's treatment must be made fresh for each patient. The reason is that the pills gradually dissolve at room temperature, as their water content breaks down the gel coating. But Minnesota doctors are experimenting with freezing the poop. This doesn't kill the bacteria, so pills could be stored and shipped anywhere a patient needed it.

"You could have a universal donor in Minnesota provide a transplant for someone in Florida. That's where we're heading," Donskey said.

Other researchers are trying to find which bacteria most help fight off C-diff. Those might be grown in a lab dish and given to patients rather than having them take the whole range of bacteria found in normal poop.

The hope is that doctors could give patients just such bacteria, Donskey said.

Louie thinks the poop pills could be used not only for those with C-diff infections, but also for other people whose gut bacteria have gone haywire. Examples include hospitalized patients, who are particularly likely to be infected by antibiotic-resistant germs.

"This approach, to me, has wide application in medicine," he said. "So it's not just about C-diff."
