WASHINGTON, D.C. — As the nation's economy continues to improve, Americans are heading South and West again in search of jobs and more affordable housing.

According to U.S. Census Bureau estimates, the 16 states and the District of Columbia that make up the South saw an increase of almost 1.4 million people between 2014 and 2015\. The 13 states in the West grew by about 866,000 people.

The gains represent the largest annual growth in population of the decade for both regions. They also signal that the multi-decade migration to the Sun Belt has resumed after being interrupted by the Great Recession of 2007-09 and the economic sluggishness and anxiety that followed.

In comparison, population growth in the Northeast and the Midwest — including what's known as the Snow Belt — remained sluggish. In those areas, the population grew by about 258,000 residents combined.

"Clearly, the Snow Belt-to-Sun Belt migration is coming back after a huge lull in response to the recession and post-recession period," said demographer William Frey, of the Brookings Institution. "Up until now, regional migration was not picking up at the same time that other economic indicators — jobs and housing — seemed to be on the upswing."

## Reshuffling House Of Representatives

The numbers indicate Americans' growing willingness to pick up and go after having sat still earlier in the economically tenuous decade. At that time, the Census Bureau reported that only 1 in 5 people who wanted to move somewhere else did so.

The new estimates, released last month, arrive midway through the decade, halfway to the next census in 2020\. They provide some indications of where the nation is headed from the standpoint of governing from Washington, as states receive representation in the U.S House in proportion to the size of their populations.

If the population shift continues, Texas could gain three new seats in the House, Florida could gain two, and Arizona, Colorado, North Carolina and Oregon, one apiece after the next census. That's according to an analysis by Election Data Services, a political consulting firm based in Virginia.

Nine states — Alabama, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and West Virginia — could lose a seat apiece.

The shift in population reflects the economic conditions many Americans experience or aspire to.

## Motivated By Jobs, Affordable Homes

A search for jobs and more affordable housing were behind two-thirds of the long-distance moves made between 2014 and 2015, according to a separate census report. Family reasons, such as getting married or rejoining relatives, accounted for another quarter of households moving.

Texas, for example — which had the biggest population gain from 2014 to 2015 — is a magnet for job-seekers from elsewhere. It has been at the fore in high job growth and outpaced the nation's economic growth since the recession.

Other Sun Belt states that witnessed a growth in population — such as Georgia and Nevada — also had some of the largest increases in job growth or economic output. So did Colorado, Oregon and Utah.

West Virginia, meanwhile, suffered a population loss of almost 5,000\. The state, which has relied economically on a declining coal industry, has higher unemployment and lower job growth rates than the national average. This gave more people more reasons to leave.

"As long as the state economy continues to stall, population loss will likely continue as well," said Christiadi, a demographer at West Virginia University.

Six other states also had population losses for the year: Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Mississippi, New Mexico and Vermont. And like West Virginia, many are struggling to provide economic opportunity. New Mexico, Connecticut and Maine had some of the lowest rates of job creation in recent years.

## Influx To Florida 

Florida's gain of almost 366,000 people to a population of 20,271,272 was its largest in a decade. It reflects another cause behind the renewed migration to the Sun Belt: The nation's swollen population of baby boomers now feels more secure economically in picking up and moving to traditional retirement oases.

"The state continues to attract retiring baby boomers because of our climate and the relatively low costs of living," said Richard Doty, a demographer with the University of Florida's Bureau of Economic and Business Research. "You can sell a home in New York or Ohio or Michigan for substantially more than you would spend in Florida, so it's still relatively attractive."

The arrival and departure of people has implications for local housing, tax bases and governments — even within state boundaries.

In Oregon, where the economy is partly being driven by chip manufacturing for firms such as Intel, young people are moving to Portland, said Josh Lehner, an economist at the state's Department of Economic Analysis. That's creating a housing shortage, as construction fails to keep up with demand.

## Population Drain From California

Many of Oregon's newcomers are from neighboring California, which had more than 77,000 people move out. That's more than twice the number who left between 2013 and 2014\. The state showed a net increase in population in 2014-15 of more than 350,000 only as a result of births and new immigrants.

Many left because of housing costs. A typical home in California costs two-thirds more than in Oregon, for example.

The cost of housing can limit the number of people willing to move into California to take even high-paying, high-tech jobs in places like San Francisco, said John Malson, chief of demographic research at the California Department of Finance.

"You have a very good job market here in tech, so people who are coming here are coming for the attractive job opportunities," Malson said. "But it's very expensive to live in California."
