WASHINGTON, D.C. â€“ Germs are tiny, tiny things that can make us sick. They are alive and can spread and grow. They make us ill when they get inside us. Sometimes they can kill us.

Germs can grow in the food we eat. Usually this happens when food is not handled carefully. When people are careless, germs have a chance to spread.

Food illnesses can hit many people at once. When that happens scientists call it an outbreak.

## More People Getting Sick In U.S.

Large outbreaks are becoming much more common in the United States. They are also becoming more deadly.

Multistate outbreaks are outbreaks that happen in more than one state. Such outbreaks are often particularly bad. The germs are usually much more deadly.

Salmonella, E. coli and listeria are the most deadly germs. They have killed many people.

Outbreaks are caused by many kinds of food. Among them are vegetables, fruits, beef and chicken.

## 22 Customers Fell Ill After Eating At Chipotle

Last weekend there was an outbreak in Washington state and Oregon. The outbreak was caused by food served by the Chipotle restaurant chain. Twenty-two people got sick. Luckily, no one died.

Salmonella caused most of the newer multistate outbreaks. It also caused the three largest outbreaks. In those cases, the salmonella was found in eggs, chicken and tuna.

## Listeria Blamed For The Most Deaths

Listeria killed the most people, though. It caused 57 of the 66 deaths from 2010 to 2104. Just in 2011, listeria in cantaloupe killed 33 people.

Sometimes when people are sickened, no one knows what food was the cause. Sometimes scientists are not even sure what the germ is.

Scientists now have new tools that will help. The tools let them easily spot a particular germ. They look to see if the same germ is in a sick person and in food they ate. If it is, they then know what caused the problem.
