Twenty-six Atlanta public school teachers and staff were in court on Friday. They pleaded not guilty to charges that they were involved in widespread cheating.

The state of Georgia accuses the teachers, principals and others of changing their students' answers on standardized tests. The school district staffers are also charged with lying to cover it up. Many got extra pay because of sharp rises in test scores. If those increases were not real, the teachers and their bosses could be found guilty of cheating. They could pay fines and even go to jail.

Beverly Hall was the head of Atlanta's public schools. Her title was superintendent. Now she is retired. She is accused of creating an environment where test scores were more important than students' education. Law enforcement officials say Hall oversaw dozens of principals and teachers who had secret meetings. In these meetings, they erased their students' wrong answers and wrote in the right ones.

In addition to the 26 who pleaded not guilty, another nine Atlanta public school staffers face charges.

Atlanta's public schools had won five National Blue Ribbon Schools Awards. The federal government gives those awards to schools with the biggest improvement in student performance. Hall was honored as national Superintendent of the Year in 2009.

Atlanta is certainly not the only place where there was widespread cheating.  But sadly, for thousands of students there, the cheating case is the worst in U.S. history.

## Climate Of Cheating

Two years ago, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper reported surprisingly large changes in test scores.  Reporters found evidence that 200 educators in 80 percent of the schools were cheating.  In some cases, the cheating had been going on for 10 years.

The newspaper also looked at many schools around the country that had won Blue Ribbon Awards. Like in Atlanta, entire grades showed dramatic changes in test scores. Experts said even much better teaching could not account for these big changes.

## High-Stakes Testing

The problems started in the late 1980s, when states began to offer bonuses to teachers and principals for raising test scores.

Then in 2001, Congress passed the No Child Left Behind law. It said every third- through eighth-grader must be tested in reading and math every year. Standard goals were set for students throughout the country. Schools that did not reach those goal could be labeled "failing" and taken over by the local school district

## Teaching To The Test

Schools desperately wanted to prevent that from happening. They began to focus teaching on what would be on the test. This was called "teaching to the test."  Teachers were then judged by how well their students did on the tests. If the students did not do well, the teachers were blamed.

In 44 Atlanta public schools, many principals were found to be involved. Teachers thought they had to go along with the cheating or else lose their jobs.  They erased incorrect answers. They let some students skip the test completely.

One mother, Justina Collins, described how the cheating hurt her daughter. The third-grader was failing in class but getting high test scores, so she could not get extra help. Today she is in ninth grade, but reading at a fifth-grade level.

"As a parent that wants the best for their child, I'm very disappointed," the mother said, her voice cracking with emotion.

## Testing At The Expense Of All Else

Some critics say relying too much on testing discourages creative teaching.  It does not allow for other ways of finding out what students know. Critics also say focusing so much on math and reading takes time away from music and art. Many schools no longer have time for recess and physical education.

Some learning experts question whether standardized tests actually measure knowledge and different kinds of ability. Can test results predict success in high school or at work? Can they measure creativity? The answer to these questions may determine education policy in the future.

Experts say too much responsibility is put on teachers and schools. Students may not do well because they do not try hard enough.  Some students are simply not good at some subjects.  There may be problems at home that affect a child's progress. Or perhaps English is not spoken in the home.

The Obama Administration began a program called "Race to the Top."  But it still relies on tests to rate students' knowledge, and scores on those tests still affect teachers' salaries.

Georgia has begun to make changes. Teachers are now evaluated in other ways besides their students' scores. When standardized tests are given, the state watches closely, looking for problems such as erasures.

U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan says honesty is very important in a school system.  He thinks the students of Atlanta were done a terrible disservice.

If ex-superintendent Hall is found guilty, she faces up to 45 years in prison.
