Most Americans know about our nation's history of slavery. Many also know about the internment of Japanese-Americans in special prison camps during World War II.

Less well-known is that for more than 60 years, the United States officially excluded an entire ethnic group: Chinese immigrants.

The Chinese Exclusion Act, as it came to be known, was passed by Congress in 1882. It was not lifted until 1943, when politicians acted partly out of embarrassment over the fact that China was a U.S. ally in World War II.

While the law kept many Chinese out of the United States, certain immigrants could get in, especially if they had money to start a business.

## One Early Arrival

One of those early arrivals was Hoy Fung, who set up what may have been the first Chinese restaurant in the Pittsburgh region, the Bellevue Tea Garden in Bellevue, Pennsylvania. The restaurant operated from 1926 to 1997, said his daughter, Karen Yee of Bethel Park.

The history of official discrimination against the Chinese is one reason that Yee became involved in the 1970s with the Organization of Chinese-Americans, now known simply as OCA.

However, she also joined the cultural and advocacy group for another reason altogether. "When my father came to America," Yee said, "he said many of the people he met in Bellevue were very helpful and kind, and so we should try to give back."

Ted Gong is another OCA activist. A retired State Department employee, Gong helped set up the 1882 Foundation to educate people about the Chinese Exclusion Act.

## Legal Discrimination

Gong said the exclusion act was preceded by many discriminatory local laws in California and other West Coast states where most Chinese immigrants first settled.

"In California, for instance, if you carried your laundry and delivered it on poles, you would be taxed more than for wagon deliveries." The higher tax rate, he said, "was clearly aimed at Chinese laundries."

Many Chinese men came to the United States to help build the western part of the transcontinental railroad. After that was completed in 1869, the nation fell into an economic slump, and there were suddenly 10,000 unemployed railroad workers on the West Coast, said historian Roger Daniels.

The Chinese immigrant population was mostly male, said Gong, and they were seen as a threat to native workers.

While the exclusion act barred "skilled and unskilled laborers and Chinese employed in mining" from entering the U.S., merchants and some others were allowed into the country. The law was essentially a sham, Daniels said, because it "really just ended immigration of Chinese laborers."

## Lonely Son, Forbidden Marriage

In the 1920s, Yee said, it was common for Chinese families to send one son abroad to earn money to send back to China, and her father took on that role. Fung, who had grown up in Guangdong, catered to what Americans thought of as Chinese food in those years, mostly chop suey and chow mein. Only later did he add Cantonese dishes, egg rolls and other menu items.

One of his first hires was a waitress, Lorraine Kristoff, whose family was from Hungary. "She said she knew two weeks after she met him that she was going to marry him," Yee said.

Neither family favored the marriage, and Kristoff's brother threatened Fung with violence.

The two went ahead with the marriage after Fung, who followed Confucian teachings, agreed to let the children be raised Catholic.

Yee and her twin sister were born during the Depression, and were followed over the years by two brothers and a sister.

## Women Kept Out

The mostly male culture of Chinese immigrants was not unique to Pittsburgh.

All but a few Chinese women had been kept out of the U.S. because of a fear that they would be drawn into prostitution. "If you were a worker then and you had finished working on the railroad or in the mines, you might turn to the opium dens" simply because so few women were around, Gong said. "I think if they had been able to have wives and families, it would have been a moderating influence."

When the exclusion act was first passed for a 10-year period, he said, 30 percent of Congress voted against it. After it was renewed and then made permanent in 1902, only one senator — George Frisbie Hoar, an outspoken Republican from Massachusetts — was willing to vote against the law.

"All races, all colors, all nationalities contain persons entitled to be recognized everywhere as equals of other men," he said. "I am bound to record my protest, if I stand alone."

## Finally, An Apology

One result of the exclusion act was that Chinese-American men who were able to go back and forth between China and the U.S. would often start families in China and then not see them for years at a time. When the law was finally lifted in the 1940s, its chief benefit was not just to allow new Chinese immigrants into the country. It also gave existing Chinese residents — and their families — the right to live together and become citizens in the U.S., Daniels said.

In 2012, Gong and others got Congress to approve a resolution apologizing for the American exclusion act.

Today, Yee knows that the Chinese immigration picture is very different from when her father came. Highly educated doctors, researchers and businesspeople make up many of the new arrivals.

While never forgetting her Chinese roots, Yee over the years has grown to love America.

"I think every group that comes in to America faces difficulty — but I also think America is a country where if you really work hard and sacrifice, you can make it. I really still think it is the best country in the world, even though it has problems," she said.
