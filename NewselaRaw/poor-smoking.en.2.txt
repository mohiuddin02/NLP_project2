PHILADELPHIA — Many people smoke after they've eaten. Lindell Harvey smokes because he hasn't.

"You smoke out of anxiety because you don't have the food you need," said Harvey, 54, who lives alone in eastern Pennsylvania. He is disabled and receives money from the Navy. Even with that money he is $2,000 below the poverty line, the government's threshold for yearly income to decide if someone is in poverty. Any single person making less than $11,490 is considered poor.

Harvey relies on his Newport cigarettes to see him through his hard days. "In my mind, the smoking becomes a comfort as I try to create ways to get food."

The poor are lacking in nearly everything important — food, jobs, medical care, and a safe place to live. But, they do have too much of one thing: Nicotine. It's the chemical in tobacco which causes people to become addicted to cigarettes.

## Less Money, More Smokers

The poor are more likely to smoke than those above the poverty line.

In Philadelphia, there is a 50 percent higher rate of smoking among the poor than people who aren't poor, Giridhar Mallya said. Mallya is a top official at the Philadelphia Department of Public Health.

Philadelphia is the poorest of the 10 largest U.S. cities. It also has one of the highest rates of smoking of any big city, according to a health department report.

The poor smoke to deal with the many ways poverty affects a person's mental health, Mallya said.

This is made worse because the poor are more likely to shop at corner stores. There, they are exposed to cigarette advertising, Mallya said.

It's also harder for the poor to get counseling to quit smoking. People with more money may receive help through insurance, which pays for healthcare, experts said.

Mariana Chilton, a health professor at Drexel University, noted the link between smoking and poverty: When you don't have money, it creates enormous mental suffering.

"One of the fastest, most convenient ways to help is a cigarette," said Chilton, an expert on hunger. "It'll keep you sane, and keep you from hurting yourself or others."

## Food For Family, A "Loosie" For Mom

Smoking is also a way to deal with hunger, Chilton said. Families without enough to eat are more likely to smoke than families with plenty of food, she said.

"Smoking treats hunger pangs," Chilton said. "Instead of having lunch, mothers will feed their children, then smoke."

That's how it works in Camden, N.J., said Elaine Styles, 51, a day care worker who lost her job.

"I smoke so I don't have to eat," she said. "I make sure my family eats, then I have a loosie (a cigarette sold singly for 50 cents or so) and go to bed."

Because smoking is costly, people ask, aren't the poor being irresponsible for spending money on cigarettes? Wouldn't that money be better spent on food?

Nationally, low-income smokers spend 14 percent of their household income on cigarettes, Mallya said. In Philadelphia, the average smoker spends about $1,000 a year on cigarettes, he added.

Cigarettes in Philadelphia are relatively cheap at $5 to $6 a pack. In other cities, added taxes make them more expensive. The more cigarettes cost, the fewer are smoked, he said.

Most poor people want to quit smoking, surveys show. But poverty itself, combined with the overwhelming power of nicotine, make stopping hard.

## Menthol Cigarettes Worsen The Problem

"People smoke knowing it is not good for them," said Frank Leone, a lung doctor who runs a smoking treatment program at the University of Pennsylvania. "Nicotine gets into the part of the brain stem that creates a sense of safety, comfort, warmth. If you have to decide between buying bread or cigarettes, not buying cigarettes creates a disease and agitation in the brain that says there's only one way to fix this situation: Just smoke."

Yale University sociologist Elijah Anderson said people shouldn't "blame the victim" by simply criticizing smoking behavior. It's important to understand the effect of poverty and its causes. Poor people may also feel like they don't have a future worth protecting with better health habits.

Among the poor, especially poor African-Americans, minty menthol cigarettes worsen the smoking problem.

Menthol is a flavor added to cigarettes. It makes the cigarette taste less harsh, which causes the smoker to take deeper, more frequent drags, Mallya said.

That, in turn, increases the harm of cigarettes.

For 50 years, menthol cigarettes were promoted in black neighborhoods. Now, 90 percent of African-American smokers in Philadelphia smoke menthol cigarettes, Mallya said.

## Secondhand Smoke Stats Slip

In Philadelphia, black people already suffer greatly from the lung disease asthma. Smoking makes everything worse, especially among children, said Brad Collins, a health professor at Temple University. Philadelphia is one of the five worst asthma cities in America, experts say.

Jerry Goldstein, a pediatrician at St. Christopher's Hospital for Children, agreed. "Secondhand and thirdhand smoke (found on clothing and walls) are seriously exacerbating kids' asthma," he said. Secondhand smoke is breathed in by people who are near smokers.

This is not to say all is hopeless. While still high, rates of secondhand smoke exposure in the city have decreased by nearly 7 percentage points between 2004 and 2012. And teen smoking is down from nearly 16 percent to more than 9 percent in the same time frame.

Mallya thinks the numbers show that public education programs to get many poor people help to quit smoking is working.

But that doesn't mean the air will clean up any time soon.
