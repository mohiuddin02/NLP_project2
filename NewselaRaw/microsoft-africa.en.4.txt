SEATTLE, Wash. â€” Anand Mariappan is from Seattle, Washington. He works at a company called Microsoft. Microsoft is a big technology business. Mariappan makes programs for Microsoft. The programs might help people add numbers. It also helps them keep information.

Usually, the people who use Mariappan's programs work in offices. They have fancy computers and the Internet.

## From Seattle To Africa

But in January, Anand left his home. He took a trip to Africa. When he was in Africa, his work was different. He helped people there learn how to use computers and start companies. He was there for three weeks.

Things were very different in Africa than they were in Seattle. Anand and his team had to make changes.

In the United States, Anand said, there are many tools that he needs to do his job. At Microsoft, there are talented people who know how to make software. The Internet is very speedy in Seattle.

In Africa, things are more difficult. There are fewer people with computer skills. The Internet does not always work.

## Teaching But Learning, Too

Microsoft sent Anand on the trip. He went with the MySkills4Afrika program. The program sends Microsoft workers to help African businesses. The workers go for two or three weeks at a time. So far, about 400 Microsoft employees have gone to Africa.

MySkills4Afrika does a few things. First, it helps Microsoft. Many companies want to have customers in other countries, especially in Africa. Second, it helps workers. A worker who travels to Africa learns new skills. When the workers return to their jobs in America, they can use these new skills. The program is also good for Africa.

Anand enjoyed his time in Africa. He went to teach businesses new tricks to help them save and make money.

One tool he brought was called Power BI. Power BI is a computer program. It is for business owners. Anand taught people how to use Power BI. While he was a teacher, he learned something, too.

"My goal was to teach," Anand said. "But I learned a lot."
