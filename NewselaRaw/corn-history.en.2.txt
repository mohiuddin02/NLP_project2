In 1493, Christopher Columbus returned to Europe with much astounding news. He had learned about many things during his travels to the New World, but few were as exciting as a promising grain he had encountered. The grain was corn and it was delicious, Columbus said. It could help feed many people back in Europe.

The only problem was that Columbus was missing an important bit of information. "He didn't take back the knowledge of how to process it," said Betty Fussell, the author of "The Story of Corn." As a result, corn did not really catch on in Europe.

Meanwhile, in the New World the story was very different. Corn grew steadily in popularity and eventually found its way to the very center of the American diet.

## America Uses The Most

Today, the United States uses far more corn than anywhere else in the world. It is in the sodas Americans drink and the potato chips they snack on. It is in hamburgers, french fries, sauces and salad dressings. It is in baked goods and breakfast cereals. It is in virtually all chicken and turkey, and even most fish. The grain is so widely used that it would take longer to list the foods that contain traces of it than to pinpoint the ones that do not.

It was not always that way, however. It took time for European settlers in North America to warm up to corn.

Until the 1800s, corn was eaten mostly by the poor. Slowly but surely, the grain spread. In time it made its way onto the dining tables of families all over the country.

Corn is easy to grow and it is also extremely inexpensive. At present, a bushel of corn costs about $4 — much less than soybeans or wheat — and the price is continuing to fall. More than anything else corn's cheapness explains why it has spread everywhere.

## Animals Eat More Than People Do

The most striking thing about the corn grown in America today is how little of it we knowingly eat.

Less than 10 percent of the corn used in the United States is directly eaten by humans. The bulk of it is either turned into ethanol, for use as fuel, or fed to the hundreds of millions of animals we raise. Cows, chickens, pigs and even fish are all fed corn. Together, animals eat several times the amount of the grain people take in each year.

The most commonly grown forms of corn can be divided into three general types.

The first is sweet corn, which Americans grill on the cob in the summer, and boil or bake during the rest of the year. Sweet corn is the most beloved variety, and is what most people think of when they hear the word "corn." However, very little of the corn we grow is sweet corn — only around 1 percent.

## Corn Syrup Sweetens Drinks

A second type, flint corn, has a soft center and harder outer shell. It is the kind of corn used to make popcorn. Flint corn first became popular in the 1960s with the introduction of easy-to-make popcorn, and it has grown in popularity since then. Much like sweet corn, however, flint corn accounts for only a tiny portion of the U.S. corn crop.

Then there is dent corn, which is the most important kind. It is also called field corn, and it accounts for the vast majority of corn grown in America today. Without even knowing it, Americans eat a huge quantity of dent corn every year. It is in most animals we eat, because it is fed to them. It is in the many, many drinks that are sweetened with corn syrup, from soda to juice. It is even in our cheese, because our cows munch on it instead of grazing on grass.

Today, corn is absolutely central to the American diet, even if we often do not notice it.

"It's in almost every product in the supermarket today," Fussell said.

Corn never did become very popular on European dining tables. However, corn is still on the march. As American-style processed foods spread around the world, cheap corn is spreading, too. Bit by bit, corn is finding its way into stomachs across the planet.
