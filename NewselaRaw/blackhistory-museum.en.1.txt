WASHINGTON — For the last eight and a half years, it has been Lonnie Bunch's job to make people believe.

Not far from the Washington Monument, Bunch, the founding director of the new National Museum of African American History and Culture, is standing on a deck outside a trailer. He looks down on at what for two years has been a construction site on the National Mall. Now it has the emerging shape and promise of a new museum.

"It's humbling," said Bunch.

As Black History Month draws to a close, construction is at the midway point for what will be a permanent symbol of the role of African-Americans throughout U.S. history.

## "Honor And Preserve"

The grand opening of the museum is expected by the end of next year or in early 2016, perhaps during Black History Month in February. But for Bunch, "every month is Black History Month. And for the Smithsonian, it's going to be for millions of people," he said.

Officials of the museum, which will be part of the Smithsonian Institution, say they have raised about $400 million toward the $500 million cost of the museum. A major contribution — $12 million — came from media superstar and actress Oprah Winfrey, who will have a theater inside the museum named in her honor.

"I want to help ensure that we both honor and preserve our culture and history, so that the stories of who we are will live on for generations to come," Winfrey said.

President Barack Obama, the first African-American commander-in-chief, attended the groundbreaking two years ago. But as Bunch raised money and developed the collection, he had to make sure people believed that the museum would be built.

"I get very emotional when I come here," he said.

It could very well be the last building to go up on the mall, sometimes referred to as the "nation's front lawn." Mall advocates, from Congress to the National Park Service to arts experts, seem to agree that nothing more can be placed along the nearly 2-mile corridor from the U.S. Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial. They believe that would detract from the green space and the array of museums and memorials.

The Smithsonian will use its empty Arts and Industries Building for a National Museum of the American Latino, which is still awaiting congressional approval.

## A Segregated Rail Car

Phil Freelon is the African-American architect from Durham, N.C., who designed the building. He imagined an angular, boxlike structure with 10 stories — five above ground, five below.

The exterior will be layered with 3,600 bronze grid panels to make it gleam. The idea is inspired by the decorative ironwork crafted by slaves in Charleston, S.C., and New Orleans.

"The skin of the building," Bunch said, who called the overall design "an homage to those hiding in plain sight."

One of the goals of the museum is to provide a sense of the struggles and successes of African-Americans. Entering the building, for instance, museum-goers will cross a water feature to recall the experience of slaves crossing the ocean to come to America.

Bunch said, "We wanted to have that right tension of the building and one of the most sacred spaces in America."

Some large artifacts, although covered in shrink-wrap, already have been put in place so that the building can be built around them.

A railroad car with different compartments for whites in the front and a sign for "colored" in the back has been restored. It serves as a compelling example of how Jim Crow-era segregation laws separated blacks and whites in public places. Jim Crow was a derogatory term for African-Americans.

Visitors will be able to walk through the 1918 Southern Railway car, used from 1940 to 1960 on routes in Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia and Florida. They will see the comfortable seating for whites and the divider that kept African-Americans in the basic seating in the back.

"This rail car … is a tangible remnant from America's long years of segregation, and those remnants are rare," said Peter Claussen, chairman and CEO of Gulf &amp; Ohio Railways that donated the rail car to the museum. "The separate water fountains are gone. The black and white sections of movie theaters are gone. There are very few objects that allow people to see what segregation was like, and this is one of them."

## Angola Prison Guard Tower

The museum also includes a 21-foot concrete guard tower from Angola prison, the Louisiana State Penitentiary that was built in the 1930s. To Bunch, the guard tower serves as a powerful symbol of the oppression of African-Americans.

Many African-Americans were rounded up as tramps and were leased out to work for residents. The practice of "convict-leasing," which began at the turn of the 20th century, "became a way to re-institute slavery," Bunch said.

The guard tower and the railway car will be featured in the museum's Segregation Gallery as part of an inaugural exhibition, "Defending Freedom, Defining Freedom: Era of Segregation 1876-1968."

A slave cabin from Point of Pines Plantation on Edisto Island, S.C., dating to the early 19th century, will tell a similar tale of life during slavery. The clapboard cabin, which will display the narrow confines of slave life, was taken apart piece by piece and shipped to Washington last May. It will be reassembled for an exhibition called "Slavery and Freedom" when the museum opens.

Currently, some artifacts intended for the museum are displayed in a temporary space across the street at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History.

For Bunch, who started out in 2005 with just two staffers and no artifacts, his long-sought goal is within reach.

"You want people to go into this museum and be changed," he said.
