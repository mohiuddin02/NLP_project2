Schools hand out many things to students during the day, such as grades and tests. Now, more and more schools are serving something else: breakfast. The number of breakfasts served in schools across the country has doubled in the last 20 years.

For many years, some schools have given poorer students free or cheaper breakfasts. The meals would be served in the cafeteria. Schools are now starting to serve breakfast in the classroom instead.

The breakfasts are given to all students. It does not matter if they are rich or poor.  Some people say these programs help students. However, others believe that serving food in the classroom takes up time that should be spent on learning. They also say that it wastes food since not all kids want or need to eat.

## Big Plans For Breakfast

The Los Angeles Unified School District is the second-biggest in the United States. It has about 650,000 students in kindergarten through 12th grade. The district has a big breakfast program. It has been growing fast. By the end of the school year, it will be serving breakfast in class at almost every LA school. Across the nation, more districts are doing the same.

People who support serving breakfast in the classroom believe the meals are a good way to help children learn. Students who come to school hungry may struggle. It is harder to learn when you have not eaten.

At Stanley Mosk Elementary in Los Angeles, breakfast is served each morning. Teachers help pass out the food. They check off which students are eating. Then, they show a video that talks about eating healthy. It all takes about 10 minutes. Students are given apples, cereal and a breakfast sandwich. By the end of the meal, sometimes there are leftovers that students do not want.

## Missing Learning Time

In Los Angeles, not everyone thinks classroom breakfasts are a good idea. Recently, some parents have begun to protest the free food programs. The parents come from richer areas and schools. They got the district to let some schools stay out of the program.

Some parents do not like the classroom breakfast programs. They believe serving food during the school day takes away learning time. When you spend time eating, you are not learning. They also worry that serving food in classrooms is not clean.

About 10 years ago, experts began to study school food programs across the country. There were many differences in the types of programs in districts and states. Some districts did not offer breakfast at all. Others served it before class. Students had to come to school early for breakfast since it was not served during class.

## The Cafeteria Is For Eating

Leaders in government are even thinking about school breakfasts. In New York City, the last mayor, Michael Bloomberg, did not agree with serving breakfast in class. He was worried that children might eat twice. The current mayor is Bill de Blasio. He supports meals in class.

At one school in Los Angeles, parents plan to continue to fight against classroom breakfasts. The school is called the UCLA Community School.

"We want them to serve it in the cafeteria," Raquel Martinez said. She has three children. "That's what the cafeteria is for."
