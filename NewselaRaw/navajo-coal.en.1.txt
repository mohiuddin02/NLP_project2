FRUITLAND, N.M. — From her bedroom window, Cynthia Dixon watches the cloud of soot rise from the coal mine near her sheep. Down the road, a hulking coal-fired electrical plant spews a yellow plume that stains the horizon.

Many days, she finds a layer of black dust coating the inside of her trailer home. Farmers say fouled air from the mine and nearby Four Corners power plant has shriveled fruits and vegetables in the field. And there are fewer eagles and jack rabbits, which once thrived on the Navajo Reservation, they add.

In the last two years, Dixon suspects, the air has killed 38 of her 56 sheep. But it's not just her animals who are suffering. The Navajo elder says the soot often leaves her gasping for breath.

## The Energy Garbage Dump

Four Corners is one of the nation's oldest coal-fired power plants. It is owned by Arizona Public Service, the state's biggest electric utility, and operated on leased Navajo land. Four Corners sits near the San Juan Generating Station, another coal-fired plant just off the reservation here in northwestern New Mexico.

Together, the facilities are the country's two largest plant emitters of nitrogen oxide gas. Nitrogen oxide can affect breathing in high concentrations, according to a study by the Los Alamos National Laboratory, a government science lab.

Scientists found the plants are at the threshold of the Environmental Protection Agency's standards for clean air. Possible changes to the standards could soon put the facilities over the legal limit, though.

The facilities rumble around the clock to light homes in faraway Phoenix and elsewhere. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of Navajo — as well as the residents of such communities as Farmington, New Mexico — live in a place environmentalists call the energy garbage dump of the American West.

## Bad Health, Good Money

Nobody knows whether the power plants are making people sick, but their presence continues to divide tribal members. Some residents blame Four Corners for high rates of asthma, pneumonia and bronchitis and bitterly criticize the hundreds of Navajo who work at the plant.

Tribal activists want the Navajo leadership to move beyond coal and invest in cleaner technologies such as solar and wind power. But officials insist the tribe needs Four Corners because it generates $40 million in annual taxes and royalties. That money is a sizable portion of the tribe's budget.

In recent years, Four Corners has improved its air quality. In 2010, the EPA ordered a cleanup; this year, Arizona Public Service closed three of the facility's five stacks and is altering the remaining two to cut emissions of nitrogen oxide by at least 30 percent, plant officials say.

But activists want more: They say there has never been a study that directly examines the health effects of Four Corners emissions. A 2010 study by the U.S. Geological Survey found that coal and wood burning inside homes on the reservation caused breathing difficulties. But the study never looked at the effects of Four Corners.

## "Where Can I Go?"

Tribal leaders regularly monitor smoke particulates from the plants, often asking residents and schools to call tribal offices with complaints. Windy days are the worst.

Dixon, 59, wants to leave. "But where can I go?" she asks.

Tribal activist Sarah White motions toward Four Corners. The 65-year-old, who has asthma, is convinced that pollution from the plant is ruining her health: "I can just imagine what I'm breathing in."

Her suspicions led her to speak out on her reservation, a place she says was once known not for air pollution but for its star-filled night skies and majestic stone structure known as Shiprock.

White joined a small but determined Navajo group called Dine Citizens Against Ruining our Environment (CARE). Members have doggedly lobbied the tribal government to end its economic dependence on coal. They stand up at tribal board meetings with questions, rallying residents to elect new leaders who are not swayed by money from the coal industry.

Going door to door, they gather petitions to draw attention to high tribal sickness rates. In 2006, Dine CARE members teamed up with the San Juan Citizens Alliance to file suit against the federal government to examine the direct health effects of both the Navajo mine and Four Corners.

## "Tough To Give Up"

This year, the government released a report saying improvements were being made at Four Corners. The report estimated the chance of getting cancer near the plant as one in a million.

Activists say a comprehensive government study of Four Corners has yet to be done.

"People think we should be happy about the closure of those three stacks, but we're not. It's like drinking 15 ounces of Drano instead of 20," said Mike Eisenfeld, of San Juan Citizens Alliance, a nonprofit group working for a cleaner environment.

Navajo leaders insist the plant and coal mine are important to the Navajo economy because they provide 800 jobs in an area where unemployment often tops 50 percent.

They recently extended the utility's lease at Four Corners until 2041 and purchased the mine near Dixon's ranch that supplies coal to Four Corners — moves they insist help guarantee the tribe's future.

Stephen Etsitty, executive director of the tribe's Environmental Protection Agency, empathizes with residents. "I tell people their issues are real," he said. "Four Corners plays a role in the community's health, but there are other factors too."

Such as plant salaries exceeding $55,000 a year. "On the reservation, that salary puts you squarely in the upper middle class," he said. "That's tough to give up."
