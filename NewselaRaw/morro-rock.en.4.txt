Morro Rock is a mountain in California. It rises 576 feet high out of the ocean. It looks almost like an island. It is attached to the coast by just a tiny strip of land. The rock is a sacred place for two local Native American tribes.

For more than 10 years, the two tribes have been arguing over who gets to climb Morro Rock. Climbing the rock is not usually allowed. But one tribe gets to climb it twice a year. The other tribe says no one should climb it.

One tribe in the dispute is the Salinan Indians. They think people should be able to climb the mountain on special religious days only. The other tribe is the Northern Chumash Indians. They think that no one should ever be allowed to walk on the rocks.

## Two Tribal Traditions

Each tribe has different traditions and different ways of celebrating the rock.

The Chumash call it Lisamu. They believe it is alive with life and want it to be protected. They do not think it should be walked on by humans.

The Salinans see something different in the rock. They call it Lesamo. They believe it is part of an ancient legend about a falcon and a serpent called Teleekatapelta.

Fred Collins is a member of the Northern Chumash Tribal Council. He helps represent the tribe. On a recent day, he stood below the rock and looked toward the sky. A falcon flew above, gliding over the jagged peaks.

Collins said that the rock is full of incredible birds, like falcons. The birds fly past Morro Rock when they migrate every year. He does not think that humans should get in the way of the birds and other animals in the area.

## A Night Of Prayer

Morro Rock has been a state landmark since 1968. It is also a protected area for falcons. People are not allowed to hike there. However, the Salinans have been climbing it since about 2000. California gave permission for tribal members to climb the rock on special days.

The Salinan Indians climb the rock for religious ceremonies twice a year. They climb once in the summer and once in the winter.

Tribal member John Burch takes part in these ceremonies. He has a special religious ritual that he practices on the mountain. It has been passed down for generations. He will sit alone at the top under the stars at night and pray. When he finishes the night of prayer, he feels as if he is "floating on air."

## "Willing To Stand Up"

The rock has a rugged landscape. It is difficult to climb. In the past, climbers have had to be rescued after failed attempts to reach the top.

The Chumash don't mind if other tribes gather for ceremonies at the base of the rock. They just care about the climbing.

"Morro Rock has such a great presence along our coast," said Collins, the Chumash tribal leader. "Fishermen and people of old times always viewed Morro Rock as a landmark in the ocean with special energies. It's a magical place."

The tribes hope they can solve this problem before the summer. If not, the Chumash might ask a court for help.

The Chumash want to fix the problem "in a positive way," Collins said. "But we're willing to stand up and not get kicked around."
