Snapchat is a popular app for cellphones. It started from an idea for a class project at Stanford University. The idea was for an app that would let users send their friends photos that would quickly disappear. At first, people thought it was a little crazy.

That was four years ago. And now, the idea that seemed impossible has turned into a famous company. Snapchat is very successful. On Wednesday, the company got a huge amount of money from a large Chinese technology company called Alibaba. With Alibaba's money, Snapchat is now worth $15 billion.

The story of Snapchat shows how fast a company can go from a small beginning to becoming powerful in the technology word.

The road to success has not been easy for the company. The startup has faced many challenges along the way.

## An App For Photos

Facebook tried to buy Snapchat in 2013. Back then, Snapchat was a much smaller company. Facebook offered to pay $3 billion but the Snapchat owners were not interested in a deal. At the time, $3 billion seemed like a high price to pay. Some people said the owners of Snapchat made a mistake to not take the money.

Even with these challenges, Snapchat is still very popular.

Snapchat was released in July 2011. It was a big hit at first with college students. When someone sends a picture through Snapchat, the photo can only be seen for a short amount of time. So it became the perfect app for sending pictures that are private. Now, people use Snapchat for many different things.

Evan Spiegel is one of the co-founders of Snapchat. He started the company with two other friends. When Snapchat first came out, he would check on how many people were using the app. At the time, he was a student at Stanford University. He would track the app during his classes. During one class, he saw one photo sent every five minutes. By the end of the same class, it was one every second. Snapchat was growing so fast that Spiegel dropped out of college to make it a real business.

## Teens And Young Adults

By summer 2013, about 4,000 snaps were sent every second. Money was pouring in from investors.

Snapchat has many features. The new features keep users interested in the app.

Right now, most people using Snapchat are teenagers and young adults. Some people say that Snapchat needs to change some things if it wants to be as successful as Facebook or YouTube. That means that Snapchat may need to think of ways to make a product that older adults, not just young people, get excited about.
