THREE RIVERS, Calif. — Visitors to Sequoia National Park often hope to spot a bear. This year, they might be disappointed. They probably have a better chance of seeing one in the town just outside the park.

Three Rivers is a town located near the middle of the state of California. It is crawling with hungry bears. They come down from the mountains because there has been no rain. Without rain, their food supply dries up. They head to town to find things to eat. They need to fatten up for winter so they can hibernate.

## Bears Up Close And Personal

Everyone seems to have pictures of the creatures on their phones. Some people tell stories about getting close to them.

Chas Haws recalled his surprise meeting with a bear one day. It happened before dawn as he walked to a coffee shop along the main road.

Haws said he carefully stepped back as the bear reared up on his hind legs. Then the bear just walked away.

"He didn't care about me at all," Haws said. "I didn't smell like a muffin — yet."

## Dry Weather Means Less Food

There is no doubt bears are all over this town. About 2,000 people live here. Some of them work in the park. Others are cattle ranchers, artists or actors.

Most people seem delighted by the visiting black bears. Many of the bears are dark and light brown. They can be seen lumbering through grasslands, trotting across roads or wading through rivers.

The dry weather has lasted for four years. It has ruined the berry crop in the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Oak trees have made fewer acorns. Bears cannot get the berries and acorns they love to eat. Now they have moved into the valleys where towns are located.

There is plenty of water in towns and acorns cover the ground.

Until this year, Gregory Lockhart had seen only one bear in 27 years. Now bears can often be spotted on the golf course out his back door. They have also been seen by the pool of a guest house.

"The park is upon us now," he said.

## Lots Of Talk About Bear Shooting

Quiet nights are often interrupted by loud noises. People may bang on pots or shoot a gun to scare off bears. Some people wonder if they are trying to kill the bears.

Jeff Beck heard dogs barking in the middle of the night followed by gunfire.

"People are shooting the bears, there's no doubt," he said.

In some cases, the law lets people shoot bears. There is a special bear hunting season. A newspaper in the area reported that bears have been illegally killed. Not everyone believes it.

Kathleen McCleary thinks it is true. "I'm upset and sad, and I just question, "Why?'" she said. "I don't see any reason to be shooting them."

Darrell Fleeman does not believe bears are being killed.

"Where's the proof?" he said. "If that were the case, there'd be dead bears everywhere."

In some towns, bears have been killed legally after they broke into cabins and cars.

In Three Rivers, bears have knocked over plenty of garbage cans and raided fruit trees and grape vines.

## Bears Need To Hibernate

At this point, gunfire might not be the biggest problem for the bears.

If they do not pack on enough pounds, they will not return to the mountains to hibernate, or sleep for the winter, said David Graber, who lives in Three Rivers. He is also a scientist who used to work for the National Park Service.

"If they don't hibernate, they're going to die," Graber said. "That's a rare, uncommon event."
