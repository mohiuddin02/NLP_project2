LONDON — Scientists in England are growing noses, ears and veins in a lab. They are making body parts for people who need them.

Scientists worldwide are now growing body parts. Mayor Boris Johnson wants to attract them to the London area. He recently showed off the London lab's work as he announced his plan to bring cutting-edge research to the city and surrounding areas.

So far, only a handful of patients have received the London-made body parts. They include veins and windpipes, as well as tear ducts — the part of the eyes where tears come out. Researchers hope they will soon be able to attach even more body parts. One of their goals is to make the world's first nose using stem cells. These are cells in the body that can be made into blood cells or skin cells.

"It's like making a cake," said Alexander Seifalian, a professor at University College London. He is the scientist leading the effort. "We just use a different kind of oven."

## Recipe For A Nose

Britain has invested $6.7 million to increase research in London. The country aims to attract companies to the area to encourage collaboration. It also hopes to boost research and manufacturing. A major center for biological research will open in London next year.

Seifalian showed off a machine that creates molds for different body parts. The material used to make the body parts is a chemical mixture called a polymer.

Last year, Seifalian and his team used that polymer material to mold a nose for a British man who had lost his when he got cancer. They added a salt and sugar solution to the mold to recreate the sponge-like feel of a human nose. Stem cells were taken from the patient's fat and grown in the lab for two weeks. Scientists then used the lab-grown cells to cover the nose. Finally, they attached the nose to the man's forearm. From there, skin grows to cover it and they can then attach it to the man's face.

Seifalian doesn't yet know when the nose can be put on the patient's face. He is waiting for the government to give him permission.

The material Seifalian uses to make body parts is protected. Other scientists cannot copy the material without permission. He wants to protect the lab's blood vessels, tear ducts and windpipes.

His team is creating other body parts, including parts of the heart and ears. The ears will be tested in India and London later this year.

## Perfecting The Nose

Ears are harder to make than noses, says Dr. Michelle Griffin. That's because it's tricky to copy all the ear's lines and curves. Griffin is a doctor who has made dozens of ears and noses in Seifalian's lab.

Today, children who need new ears need a major surgery, says Griffin. Doctors take material from the child's ribs and use it for the ears.

Griffin also said the team plans to create a man-made face. They must first prove their material is safe.

Scientists have to perfect noses and ears before making more complicated body parts, explains Eileen Gentelman. She is a professor at King's College London. She is not involved in Seifalin's research. Among the more challening body parts to make are kidneys, lungs and livers. Gentelman calls Seifailan's accomplishment "pretty amazing."

Some scientists say they believe lab-made body parts won't be just in laboratory experiments for long. They are going to be on the market soon, according to Suchitra Sumitran-Holgersson. She is a professor in Sweden.

She has given lab-made blood vessels to a handful of patients. She plans to offer them more widely by 2016. She must first wait for the government's permission.

Seifalian has high hopes for lab-made body parts. He says they may one day cost only a few hundred dollars. Different sized noses could be mass produced in a factory one day. Doctors first choose the nose size. Then they could tailor the nose for a patient and implant it.
