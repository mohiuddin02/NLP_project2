This week Harrisburg's Patriot-News retracted the article and apologized. It said the critique of Lincoln's speech was flawed and tainted by excessive pride. Moreover, it lacked the understanding that would come with history.

With that, the newspaper printed an unusual media apology. The retraction has captured national attention despite its less-than-serious approach.

The apology said that the people who used to run the newspaper may have been influenced by politics. Or they may have been under the influence of "strong drink, as was common in the profession at the time." The editors back then called President Lincoln's words "silly remarks" that deserved to be forgotten. The newspaper said the old editors seemed to believe the speech was "an indifferent and altogether ordinary message, unremarkable in eloquence and uninspiring" because it was short.

## Got It "Jaw-Droppingly Wrong"

"Just think: The speech, the exact words of it, are still looked at, thought about and" taken apart, said Michele Hamill of Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. One of five copies of Lincoln's handwritten speech is on display at Cornell in remembrance of its delivery on Nov. 19, 1863.

"He was a very thoughtful writer, and it shows," Hamill said. She was referring both to the penmanship and the substance of the speech. The speech was short — about two minutes — but memorable.

The current Harrisburg editors ran their editorial Thursday with a column explaining the decision to declare: "The Patriot-News regrets the error."

Donald Gilliland wrote the article that explained the decision. He noted that the dismissive comments about Lincoln's address did not appear until five days after he had delivered it. Days earlier, the paper — then called the Patriot &amp; Union — had devoted a great deal of coverage to the president's visit to the Pennsylvania city. The speech was given at the dedication of a cemetery to Union soldiers killed during the battle there four months earlier.

Gilliland wrote that the harsh words that appeared on Nov. 24, 1863, earned the newspaper "an enduring place in history for having got Lincoln's Gettysburg Address utterly, jaw-droppingly wrong."

## Speech Still Resonates

This isn't the first time a newspaper has apologized many years after the fact. In 2004, the Lexington Herald-Leader in Kentucky apologized for its failures in covering the civil rights movement in the 1960s. The Meridian Star in Mississippi printed an apology timed for President Barack Obama's 2009 inauguration. It said that it, and many papers across the South, had failed in their duty to report on important civil rights events.

The Patriot-News retraction lacks the somber tone of those apologies. But it is no less significant, said Todd Gitlin. He is a professor of journalism at Columbia University.

He said Lincoln's message — that the nation was in a fight for democracy — is as true today as it was then. He mentioned the current battles over issues such as voter ID laws. Civil rights activists say the laws are designed to limit minority voting.

Five copies of the speech exist: two in the Library of Congress, one in the White House, one at the Illinois State Historical Library and one at Cornell. All are written in Lincoln's neat penmanship, but they contain slight differences.

The copy at Cornell, for example, reads "on this continent" instead of "upon this continent" in the famous first line.

That sets it apart from the two in the Library of Congress. Those were written before Lincoln delivered the address.

Lincoln wrote the Cornell copy a few days after the speech. He was asked to by George Bancroft, a historian who wanted to make copies of the document to raise money for wounded soldiers.

## Written In Perfect Penmanship

Hamill said Lincoln used high-quality paper and special ink. He sent it to Bancroft, but the effort fell flat. That's because Lincoln had written on both sides of a piece of paper. Technology did not allow the copying of double-sided documents. Bancroft asked for another copy.

"Imagine, this is a time of war and you're asking Lincoln again to do this thing," Hamill said.

The president sent Bancroft a fresh copy. This time he used two pieces of paper. Bancroft was left with what at the time seemed to be a "piece of useless paper," Hamill said, but he held onto it and willed it to his grandson, a chemistry professor at Cornell.

During the Depression, the document was sold to a New York City dealer. But it eventually ended up back in Cornell's hands, where it is guarded by a university police officer while it is on display.

Hamill marveled at the idea that a president had taken the time to write out his speech five times while a war was happening. And that he did it in perfect penmanship.

The Patriot-Union said that with the anniversary of the speech, "the time was ripe" to clear the air.

"Really, this isn't a question of journalism ethics, as would be the case with a serious retraction," wrote the paper's deputy opinion editor, Matthew Zencey. "It was more a way of using the 150th anniversary to say, with a wink, 'Gee, can you believe what rock heads ran this outfit 150 years ago?' "
