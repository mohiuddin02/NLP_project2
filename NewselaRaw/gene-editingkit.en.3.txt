BURLINGAME, Calif. — Josiah Zayner is working at his kitchen table in Burlingame, California. He is a 34-year-old scientist with dyed hair and pierced ears. Zayner wears a T-shirt that says "Go Ninja Go." On his arm is a drawing that says "Build Something Beautiful."  

Zayner is cutting, pasting and stirring genes together. Genes are made of DNA. DNA contains the information that tells the body how to grow and work. It is the body's instruction manual. DNA is passed on from parents to children in people, and works the same way for other living things. Zayner makes mixes in tiny glass containers. When he is done, he puts his mixtures onto a refrigerator shelf. He works with the window shades pulled down so neighbors cannot see him.

Zayner makes gene-changing sets and sells them. He wants everyone to work with genes. His sets have lab rules, tools that do not cost much, and directions.

## At First, Only Big Labs Could Do It

Some people worry that there are no laws about homemade science. They think that new germs could be released. A germ is a tiny living thing that can make people sick. Other people think science at home is a great idea. They imagine a day when anyone can make things to help people and nature.

Moving genes from one living creature to another was once rare. Later, it was done only in big labs. Three years ago, scientists in California invented a gene-changing tool. However, only schools and businesses can get it.

Zayner is the first to sell a gene-changing tool to regular people. His set is not dangerous. Zayner's germs cannot do much. They can change only their color or smell, and they live for only a short time.

## Early Computers Were Homemade, Too

Zayner is convinced that people doing science at home can help solve big problems. He says, "They can change the face of the world we live in."

He says homemade science is just like the early days of home computers. Then, people like Steve Jobs worked at home. They met with other people who had new ideas too. Some of them went on to do important things. Steve Jobs and a friend invented Apple computers. 

Jacob Corn is a scientist in California. He supports Zayner's idea. Corn says that it could never be used to change human genes. He thinks it is a good way to teach people how to work with genes.

## Scientists Ask For More Rules

Some experts are worried that there are no laws about tools like Zayner's. They say that it could be dangerous for nature and for people.

Some scientists have asked leaders to make better rules for homemade science. They want to make sure that nobody makes germs that might escape.

Dr. David Relman is a disease expert in California. He worries that the tools will make gene changing too easy. People might make dangerous germs.

Relman wrote in a magazine for scientists. He said that he is worried about labs that are developing new germs to study. Some scientists are creating types of the deadly bird flu that is easier to catch. Relman says that this can be done in small labs. Some experts worry that there is no way to control what people are doing in these small labs.
