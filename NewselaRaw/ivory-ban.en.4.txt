WASHINGTON â€” The United States is trying to stop the unlawful hunting of elephants in Africa. Its plan is to get tough on the sale of ivory. The elephants are being killed so their tusks can be turned into ivory gifts or art.

President Barack Obama announced a plan to stop the ivory trade on Tuesday. The U.S. wants to fight the trade all around the world. The ivory business kills huge numbers of animals every year. And it makes huge amounts of money for the people who run it.

"We're seeing record-high demand for wildlife products," said Grant Harris. He works for the White House. He explained that this is because of growth in the ivory trade.

Wildlife supporters are concerned that all the elephants and rhinos will die out. Dan Ashe runs the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. He said there were once millions of elephants in Africa. Now there are just 500,000 animals left. Another 35,000 elephants are being killed each year.

## Stopping Ivory Sales

The White House's plan uses laws that have been around for many years. But these laws have not been strictly used. Once the ivory is in the U.S., sales are not really controlled. Police will not question someone who sells one piece of ivory.

It is not against the law to sell some types of ivory. It is allowed to sell ivory that is more than 100 years old. Ashe said that this provides a "smoke screen" for the sales that are not allowed. It also makes it harder for police to catch people working in the trade.

If someone is caught trying to sell ivory now, the government will take it away. Sellers can keep the ivory if they can prove it is allowed. Ashe said he wants to send out a message to ivory buyers. They must be very careful that they are not breaking the law.

Officials are confident that they can stop nearly all ivory sales. The U.S. wants to set an example the rest of the world. Then other countries will also take steps against the ivory trade. The U.S. hopes this will drive down demand for ivory everywhere.

Last year, the U.S. destroyed more than six tons of ivory. This included tusks, carvings and jewelry. Last week, France crushed more than three tons of ivory. China and Gabon have also destroyed ivory.

China has the biggest demand for ivory. The U.S. is in second place. In China, ivory costs more than $1,000 a pound. The price of ivory has increased greatly, according to the World Wildlife Fund.

## Senseless Killing Of Wildlife

Carter Roberts is president of the World Wildlife Fund. He said that Obama and Congress have sent out a very strong message. The U.S. will no longer allow the senseless killing of wildlife.

The government won't chase individual people for selling ivory. Instead, it will target the organized gangs that run the trade.

Last year, the government launched "Operation Crash." This project went after a group that sold rare black rhino horns. Fourteen people have been arrested so far. Seven have been charged with crimes.

President Obama also called on Congress to pass more laws. Other people will make sure the new crackdown is strong enough. There are plans to use stronger laws to catch people in the ivory business.

The Safari Club International Foundation represents animal hunters. This group doesn't like Obama's new plans. The foundation thinks that the new laws do not work closely enough with people and businesses in Africa.

Joe Hosmer is the group's president. He said that government actions can spoil projects that protect animals. He argued that these are already working well. Hosmer said that working with people in Africa is the best way to look after wildlife.
