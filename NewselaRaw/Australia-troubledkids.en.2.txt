YUENDUMU, Australia â€” The elders of the Warlpiri tribe in Australia look at a person's footprints. A good person, they believe, leaves good prints in the red dust.

Four years ago, Sebastian Watson's footsteps were said to have turned bad for a time. He had a brush with police and was charged with attacking someone. The elders of the remote Warlpiri community in Yuendumu sent him off to Mount Theo, where Peggy Brown and her husband care for troubled youth.

Brown's face is as wrinkled as the stony hills that rise from the surrounding desert. She made Watson healthy on the outside with good food and healthy living. She also worked to make him strong on the inside. She surrounded him with the ancient culture of the Warlpiri, one of the original peoples of Australia, with their deep connection to land, family and ceremony.

## "It's A Healing Place"

After his arrival, Watson was asked to fetch wood for a campfire. He walked into the bush and tore a branch from a dry tree.

When the flames from the campfire crackled up, "I felt the spirit of the tree, and the spirit of the fire," Watson recalled. "I believe I was being healed spiritually because it's a healing place."

Around the campfire, Brown taught the troubled youngsters about their Warlpiri history and way of life and also about things that kill the culture: alcohol, drugs and violence.

When he lay down to sleep, Watson said, "the spirit of the land met my spirit inside me. The spirit talked and talked. I could feel it. My spirit listened." While he was lying there, he felt the worry leave his body.

Watson said that the spirit told him: "You are gifted, you've got to use these gifts in a good way. Don't ruin these gifts with sorrow."

## Drugs Endanger A Generation

Watson now works for the Warlpiri Youth Development Aboriginal Corp., helping troubled young people.

The Walpiri Youth Corp. began 20 years ago, when a drug problem swept the tribe. Young people began sniffing gasoline to escape their problems. However, sniffing gasoline is very dangerous, because gasoline contains poisons that harm the body, and can cause brain damage and even death. Elders became afraid that a generation of children would be lost, and with them centuries of history and culture.

Reciting their story, white-haired elders and other leaders sat in a half circle. They spoke sometimes in the musical Warlpiri language, which sounds like a bubbling creek, and sometimes in English.

When the youngsters began sniffing gas, the elders started nightly patrols to take the youths home, they said. But the children, some as young as 11, just did it again next day.

## Sent To Mount Theo

Eddie and Lottie Robertson described their torment when their two sons started sniffing.

"I used to go around looking for them. They were always in dark houses, where the old houses were, out near the airstrip," Lottie Robertson said. When she told her sons to come home, they only looked at her and laughed, she said.

Desperate, the elders called a community meeting. That is when they decided on the plan to send the troubled youth to Mount Theo, which the Walpiri believe has healing qualities. Sending the youths far away was part punishment, but it was also meant to heal and teach them the Warlpiri culture.

Brown continues to work in the bush healing troubled youths. He offers rewards for those who change, like sports and trips into the bush to learn about Warlpiri culture.

Sebastian Watson and another counselor, Geraldine Dixon, get calls day and night about family crises and teens behaving violently. At least once, a young person considered killing themselves.

## Hey, These Ants Taste Good!

When the rains come, the bush turns a soft gray-green, and honey ants burrow up seeking moisture.

Dixon, who is also Watson's mother-in-law, speaks in a voice so soft that at times it fades into the steamy hot afternoon. She uses the same calm voice when faced with a crisis. After the rains end, Dixon goes into the bush with a group of troubled girls.

Dixon shows them where to dig down to find honey ants, the sweetest thing in the harsh outback. Honey ants, whose tails are swollen with nectar, are at the center of Warlpiri "dreaming." These are their tribal stories that explain life, existence and how the world was created.

The girls pluck the honey ants from their nests, sucking the honey from their yellow tails. The taste of the sweet nectar bursts on the girls' tongues. The trip pulls them back to life and a feeling of hopefulness.
