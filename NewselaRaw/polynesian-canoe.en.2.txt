The 18th-century British navigator Captain James Cook is celebrated as the first European to explore the South Pacific. Centuries earlier, however, Polynesian seafarers sailed the same seas. Their canoes crossed vast stretches of water to colonize mostly empty islands from Samoa and New Zealand all the way to Hawaii. How they managed such a feat has long been something of a mystery.

Now, a roughly 600-year-old canoe discovered in New Zealand may shed some light. The vessel, which is described in a new study, is one of just two canoes dating back to such an early time period.

The canoe — or, to be exact, a large section of it — was discovered in 2012 on New Zealand's South Island, following a storm which dislodged it from a sand dune. The 19.95-foot-long section of hull is part of a sophisticated canoe carved from a single tree.

## "Took Your Breath Away"

Few such vessels have lasted long enough to be found, because wood usually decays quickly. Fortunately the area where it was buried allowed the canoe to survive the centuries because it was swampy and low in oxygen that would have caused it to break down, researchers said. Its shape turned out to be very unlike the boats that early European explorers had described when they arrived to the South Pacific.

"It was one of those situations where it sort of took your breath away," said study author Dilys Amanda Johns. "I'd never seen anything like it."

Using radiocarbon dating, the team found that the canoe was last repaired with caulk around the year 1400. The canoe, known as a waka, was probably at least 45.9 feet long when it was whole, Johns said.

## Unique Symbol: A Sea Turtle

The image of a sea turtle is carved into the hull. Such symbols are rarely found in the Maori culture of New Zealand. The Maori are Polynesians who sailed canoes from Polynesia between 1250 and 1300 and settled New Zealand.

Sea turtle images were however featured throughout other peoples in Polynesia. Sea turtles were held in high regard in Polynesia, and were celebrated for their long ocean voyages.

"A sea turtle on a 600-(year)-old Polynesian canoe is a unique and powerful symbol," the study authors wrote.

A few features, including four ribs carved into the hull, haven't been known historically in New Zealand, but were seen in canoes in the Southern Cook Islands as late as 1913.

## Know Which Way The Wind Blows?

The New Zealand canoe also shares some design elements with a canoe found about 30 years ago in the Society Islands. The Society Islands canoe is thought to be from the same time period as the New Zealand one, even though it was discovered 2,500 miles away. Clearly, the Polynesians knew how to get around.

Scientists have tried to understand what sort of boats would have allowed seafaring Polynesians to brave the waters and winds. Without discoveries like the one in New Zealand, researchers have to rely on far less direct evidence. In large part, they have had to rely on the much-later observations of European explorers.

Based on the wind patterns we know today, the Polynesians appear to have traveled against the wind during their colonizing voyages. Researchers have therefore concluded that they must have had fairly high-tech sailing canoes.

Recently, however, a team led by Ian D. Goodwin has challenged that idea. Shifting ancient wind patterns, Goodwin claims, may have created ideal windows of opportunity for certain generations of sailing Polynesians. Sophisticated sailing canoes would not have been necessary under such conditions, though of course that doesn't mean the Polynesians didn't have them.

## Skillful Sailors

Goodwin's team created a model of wind patterns during the time of the Polynesian colonizing voyages. Their model shows that at key periods, the winds favored travel to distant islands. For example, based on their model, the winds favored sailing from East Polynesia to New Zealand from 1140 to 1260. From 1250 to 1280, they favored travel to Easter Island.

The sailing conditions the team found would have allowed relatively simple canoes to travel all known routes.

For her part, Johns is not entirely convinced by the Goodwin study. While the patterns Goodwin found may have been helpful, she said, the ending of such favorable wind patterns doesn't appear to have stopped the Polynesians.

"We think Polynesians were really good sailors," said Johns, speaking from New Zealand. "We think they were able to sail down here with or without help."
