WASHINGTON â€” The Library of Congress is more than just a library.

The collection represents what the people of the United States have done. It covers Americans' history and their art. It was started in 1800.

It has more than 23 million books. It also houses millions of other items, from newspapers to music and movies.

The Library of Congress had a special royal visitor last month: Britain's Princess Anne. The princess was greeted by trumpeters and choirs.

She was there to loan the library one of just four original copies of the Magna Carta. The Magna Carta was written in 1215 and gave people in England their rights. Many U.S. laws are based on it.

Princess Anne was the special guest. However, the white-haired man who sat next to her was the one who made the event happen. In fact, he is the man who makes everything big happen at the Library of Congress.

His name is James H. Billington.

## A Very Important Job

Billington has been the librarian of Congress for more than 25 years. He is in charge of the library's huge collection. He is only the 12th librarian there ever.

The title "librarian of Congress" might sound old-fashioned. But Billington is up to date on things. He has worked hard to make use of the newest technology. He believes putting the library's collection online is important.

The World Digital Library is just one of the projects Billington has worked on. It links libraries around the world together online.

He also adds works of art, music and movies to the library.

The Library of Congress is in four buildings. Three are on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., and the fourth building is in Virginia.

Billington has done a great job, said David Rubenstein. He raises money for the library.

"He's as good a librarian as we've ever had," said Rubenstein. Billington has made it easier for ordinary people to use the library, Rubenstein said. He has done it by putting so much material online.

## Protecting And Sharing The Library

Billington served in the U.S. Army as a young man. He then taught history at Harvard University and Princeton. Billington has written five books.

In 1987, President Ronald Reagan made him librarian of Congress. The job can be held for as long as he lives.

Billington said that meeting Princess Anne was "quite special."

He has not always been around the rich and famous, though. Billington grew up poor in Philadelphia. However, there were always books around the house. To reward his children, his father would bring books home. Usually, they were used books that cost just 5 cents.

Billington is 85 years old. Even so, he does not plan to stop working anytime soon. He hopes to keep making it easier for people to use the library's huge collection.

Billington feels like he has a mighty mission. It is his duty to protect, preserve and share American art and history.
