WASHINGTON â€” Andy Wills was laying on a friend's couch in Cordova, Alaska, on March 24, 1989. He was up early, ready to head out and fish for herring in Prince William Sound.

"My buddy had just handed me a cup of coffee in the morning and we're watching 'Good Morning America,'" Wills said. "And there's the Exxon Valdez on TV, spilling oil."

He added, "We were like, 'No!' It was just the start of a nightmare."

The herring of Prince William Sound still have not recovered. Neither have killer whales, and legal issues remain unresolved a quarter of a century later. Monday marked the day when the disaster struck, 25 years ago. On that day, the tanker Exxon Valdez struck a reef and spilled at least 11 million gallons of oil into the waters of the sound. At the time, it was the nation's largest oil spill.

## Recovery Open To Debate

Prince William Sound today looks breathtaking. It's a stunning setting of cliffs, blue-green waters and thickly forested islands. Pick up a stone on a rocky beach, maybe dig a little, though, and it is possible to still find pockets of oil.

"I think the big surprise for all of us who have worked on this thing for the last 25 years has been the continued presence of relatively fresh oil," said Gary Shigenaka. He's a marine scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

The question of how well Prince William Sound has recovered is open to debate. Exxon Mobil Corp. says studies show the area is bouncing back. Exxon Mobil is the company that was shipping oil inside the Valdez.

The area where the spill happened is doing very well and there has been "a very solid, complete recovery," said Richard Keil, a spokesman for Exxon Mobil.

Government scientists have a different view.

The Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council is a group set up to make sure the Prince William Sound returns to its normal environment. It considers the numbers of pink and sockeye salmon to be back to normal. Bald eagles and harbor seals have also bounced back. Several other species are listed as recovering but not recovered.

## "People Got Real Hurt"

Sea otters have had a rough time. Thousands died in the months following the spill, and the population has struggled to recover in the 25 years since. The U.S. government reported earlier this month that the sea otters of the area had finally returned to their pre-spill numbers.

Still not recovering are the herring, a group of killer whales and a type of seabird.

Wills, who fished salmon as well as herring, said the spill left a huge mark on those who made a living from Prince William Sound.

Exxon gave money to pay people for losses, but checks were too late and too little, he said.

"A lot of people got real hurt. I got divorced. It was rough," said Wills, who now runs a bookshop and cafe in Alaska.

Among the scientific puzzles of the spill, the fate of the herring is a particular mystery. It's an essential species for the ecosystem. Whales, salmon and birds all feed on it.

## Herring Never Recovered

Prince William Sound was home to a moneymaking spring herring fishery. It helped fishermen who were badly in need of cash in between fishing seasons.

Scientists found physical abnormalities in herring exposed to the oil. Then, four years after the spill, the herring population crashed dramatically. The reasons are a subject of intense debate. Suggestions have been made that the effects of the spill could have made the herring weak against disease.

The herring never really recovered, and herring fishing has been closed for most of the last 20 years.

The killer whales of Prince William Sound also have suffered. Two groups were hit especially hard. Scientists saw killer whales from one of the groups swimming through oil floating on the ocean surface. A Los Angeles Times photo showed whales from the other group swimming near the tanker as it gushed oil. Populations dropped dramatically in the year after the spill.

One of the groups continues to slowly recover. The other numbered 22 killer whales at the time of the spill and is down to just seven. Scientists now expect it to go extinct. If so, it would be the end of a whale line that has hunted in the area for thousands of years, maybe since the last ice age.

The federal and state governments are still weighing the science of the spill's effects. Court cases will decide whether to seek more money from Exxon Mobil for cleaning up remaining oil.
