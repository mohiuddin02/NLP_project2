LOS ANGELES â€” In 1970, Helen Singleton and six other students painted a mural on a wall in the student union building at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). It was a tribute to African-American history and the civil rights struggle.

The artwork was a collage of photos of famous African-Americans. It was also a kind of self-portrait. It showed the faces of the students who created it. The students' faces stared out into Ackerman Union. Their faces and hair were made from small images of famous African-Americans.

After graduating in 1974, Singleton took a job at UCLA. Over the years she occasionally stopped at the mural to look at the artwork and think about her classmates.

Then one day in 1992, she saw the mural was gone. A wall stood in its place.

"I was devastated," said Singleton. In 1970, when Singleton helped make the mural, she was a 37-year-old mother.

## The Art Was Safe, Just Hidden

Singleton, now 81, was afraid the artwork had been painted over. She made a few phone calls to find out. Singleton discovered that a wall had been placed in front of the mural.

"We wanted to get it out" from behind the wall, she remembers. "But nobody was sure how to."

So the mural remained behind the wall. By remaining hidden, generations of students were unaware of a part of UCLA history. The school experienced the activism of the Vietnam War era and, in particular, the nation's civil rights struggle.

The idea for the artwork came after a violent campus protest on May 5, 1970. The day before, there was a Vietnam War protest in Ohio. Students were showing that they wanted the war to end and soldiers were called in to stop the protest. The soldiers shot some of the students.

Students were enraged and the shootings caused protests all over the country.

At UCLA's protest, university officials declared the first state of emergency in the school's history. More than 70 students were arrested. Twelve students and 10 police officers were injured in clashes.

## Using Art For A Quiet Protest

Singleton was against the war. Yet, she didn't take part in the protests. She had to care for her young children. She and some other art students still wanted to do something.

The students knew that UCLA was planning to repaint parts of one of the buildings. They persuaded the school to give them $300 to paint the mural.

The seven began by having their photo taken. Then they gathered Ebony magazines and books and chose photos of important figures from African-American history. They cut out photos of Martin Luther King Jr., Muhammad Ali and others. The photos became a collage filling most of the mural.

The artwork was covered when the building was fixed up in 1992.

Afrikan Student Union members and others raised money to help pay to take down the wall in front. Earlier this year workers began the task.

## There's History In The Mural

The mural was dirty and had some damage. It took several months to clean and repair the painting. The mural was officially unveiled last Wednesday.

Kamilah Moore is the Afrikan Student Union's chairwoman. She hopes the mural will remind young students about history. She also hopes that it might help bring black students to UCLA. Fewer than four out of every 100 undergraduates at the university last fall were African-American. Some people believe that is too few.

Singleton said she was happy to see her work restored. Yet there was a sad note. She and UCLA tried to find others pictured in the mural but could not track them down. Singleton thought that the other four women may have gotten married and changed their last names, making them harder to find.

"I really would like to see them again," she said. "It's been a long time."
