LONDON â€“ Famous works of art have been discovered in an old man's home in Germany. They were thought to have been destroyed or lost during World War II. But police discovered them when they entered the man's home.

What they found was astonishing: paintings by Pablo [Picasso](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Picasso), Marc Chagall, Henri Matisse and Paul Klee. They found 1,406 works of art in all. The art is believed to be worth at least $1.3 billion. Some or all of the art was thought to have been stolen by the Nazis more than 70 years ago. That would make it one of the largest collections of art recovered since World War II.

The police found out about the man two years ago because he was carrying about $12,000 on a train from Switzerland to Germany. That was a large amount of money. He seemed nervous. The police felt that something was not right.

Later, they raided the apartment in Munich where the man lived. His name is Cornelius Gurlitt, 80. His father was an art seller during World War II. Cornelius got the art from him.

## Search For Rightful Owners Of Artworks

The stunning find was reported Sunday by the German magazine Focus.

It is one of the largest collections of stolen art, says Julian Radcliffe. He tracks works of art that have vanished. "Two years ago we found a dealer who had two stolen pictures in his safe when he died, and we thought that was pretty shocking. To find one on this scale is exceptional."

The Germans are suspected of stealing 650,000 artworks around the time of the war. Though the Munich discovery is huge, there is much more still lost.

Gurlitt's home was raided in early 2012. The German government has been quiet about what is happening with the art. The works have been moved for safety and the search goes on for the art's rightful owners.

Many of the original collectors could be Jewish families. Often they had art stolen by the German government. Others sold the art cheaply to quickly flee Europe to save their own lives.

## Put A Beckmann Painting Up For Sale

The police took a long while to admit the discovery. And they have not given out a full list of the works of art found. That disturbs people who are working to return stolen art to their proper owners.

Anne Webber works for a group that tracks stolen art. She said the German authorities have not been open enough. "Families have been looking for (their) art for 75 years," she said.

Focus said that Gurlitt sold some art when he needed money. In one instance, he put a painting by German artist Max Beckmann up for sale.

Family members of the original owner heard about the sale. They claimed the painting as theirs. They made a deal with the company running the sale. So the sale went ahead, Webber said. The work sold for nearly $1.2 million when it was auctioned to the highest bidder.

"What would have happened if the family had not identified it?" Webber asked.

## Artworks Had Been Believed Destroyed

Gurlitt's father was an art seller. The Germans asked him to help them collect and get rid of art. Some of the art was taken by force from Jews. Many of the pieces Gurlitt's father had were believed to have been destroyed during bombings.

At the end of the war he was asked what art he had. People thought he had "a truckload of art, and he said, 'It's all rumors, all of it was destroyed,'" Webber said. Other sellers who handled stolen art for the Germans built big collections.

Not much is know about Gurlitt. His name could not be found on any government lists. It is believed that he didn't pay taxes.

If the owners of some of the artworks cannot be found, Gurlitt may keep them. That would upset Jews who survived World War II and their families. Many have fought to have their art returned to them.
