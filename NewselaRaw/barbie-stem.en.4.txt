CHICAGO, Ill. — Many people think that dolls can send the wrong message to children. Dolls are not always good role models. They are not always good to look up to.

Most dolls are pretty. Often they do not look like real kids. Some are really skinny. This can make kids think they should look like the doll, even if it is not healthy. 

Sometimes, dolls have jobs. Kids that play with dolls learn about their jobs. If dolls go shopping, kids learn about shopping. If dolls learn about outer space, kids want to learn about outer space.

## One Doll Likes To Study Space

More and more dolls do things that kids can look up to. One new doll is interested in space. It comes with tools for learning about the stars. 

These new dolls are called STEM dolls. STEM stands for science, technology, engineering and math. The dolls teach about STEM. They also look healthy. The dolls are not too skinny. They dress like most girls do.

Jackie Breyer writes about toys for a website. She said that parents are making STEM dolls popular. They are buying many of them.

STEM toys are usually bought for boys. Buying STEM dolls for girls can help them learn. STEM toys can help girls to be smart in many ways.

Scott Friedland works at a toy store. He sells STEM toys. He said that STEM dolls are good for girls. They get girls into STEM at a young age.

## New Dolls Look More Like Real Kids

Friedland also said that STEM dolls look like kids. STEM dolls wear long-sleeve shirts, shorts and baseball caps. They do not wear makeup or high heels. They teach girls that they can be themselves and be smart.

Terrand Bashua is a mom in Chicago. She is thinking about buying a STEM doll. She said more girls need to learn about STEM. She hopes that STEM toys can help her daughter learn about STEM. Then she can choose any job she wants when she is older.
