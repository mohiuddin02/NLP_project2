SAN JOSE, Costa Rica â€” The United Nations, or U.N., was founded in 1945 to help countries work together. Almost all of the world's countries are members. The U.N. can't actually force member nations to do anything. Its suggestions and opinions are taken very seriously.

Right now, the United Nations is pushing to help Central Americans who have been coming into the United States illegally.

Central Americans are crossing the border into the United States in large numbers, many of them without permission. The United States treats them as migrants. That means they are defined as people who immigrated to look for a better life.

If they are caught entering this country, they are sent back without being able to defend themselves in court.

## Let's Reconsider What To Call Them

The U.N. says that many Central Americans should no longer be thought of as people looking for jobs. Instead, they should be considered refugees.

Refugees are people who have been forced to leave their country because of serious danger. Unlike economic migrants, refugees are not simply seeking work. Typically, they are fleeing violence. The danger they face is considered to be a reason to let them stay in the United States.

Calling [Central Americans refugees](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Central+american+emigration) won't change the law, but it might increase pressure on the United States and Mexico. It could pressure both countries to allow many people to stay. Now, those people are not protected.

The U.N. is hoping for an important change this week. They will discuss new ways of thinking about refugees. Perhaps Central Americans can be considered refugees.

If that happens, the U.N. said, it could mean one big change. Central Americans may no longer be "automatically sent to their home countries." Their cases may at least be looked at more carefully.

## The Most Dangerous Trio

Most people considered to be refugees are fleeing wars. Central Americans are fleeing crime. Many Central American countries have been taken over by gangs.

Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras are among the most dangerous countries on Earth. Large areas of all three countries are controlled by gangs. Violence is very common.

"They are leaving for some reason," said Fernando Protti. He works for the United Nations. "Let's not send them back" automatically, he said. Instead, we should look at "the reasons they left their country."

The United States has seen a big increase in the number of Central Americans coming illegally. More and more children are coming to the United States all alone. More than 52,000 children have been caught since October. Most of the children say they are running away from the gangs.

The United Nations can't force the United States and Mexico to accept Central Americans as refugees. However, a change in thinking could lead to real change. It could put pressure on the two countries to do more.

U.N. official Leslie Velez declared that "children and families who fear for their lives" should be treated fairly. They must not be returned automatically, she said. Instead, they should be given the chance to argue why they should be allowed to stay.
