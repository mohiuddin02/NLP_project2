WASHINGTON — During his State of the Union address Tuesday, President Barack Obama urged the nation to "turn the page" on its past years of economic troubles, terrorism and lengthy wars. He argued that his presidency had ushered in an era of smarter American leadership and more jobs.

"It's now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next 15 years, and for decades to come," Obama said in parts of the speech. The White House had released sections of his State of the Union address to news media before he gave the televised speech.

Obama was speaking to a Congress controlled by Republicans for the first time in his presidency. But the policies he was calling for suggested he had no intention of altering his own plans to please Republicans.

## "Expanding Opportunity Works"

Instead, Obama was proposing higher taxes on wealthy Americans. The additional money would be used to pay for middle class tax credits and to make community college free. But key elements of the president's economic proposals appear unlikely to pass in Congress. Obama's proposals appeared to also be focused on setting a tone for the 2016 election and selling the story of an economy now ready to move away from austerity programs. Austerity economics focus on keeping government spending low during tough economic times.

"The verdict is clear," Obama said. "Middle class economics works. Expanding opportunity works. And these policies will continue to work, as long as politics don't get in the way."

New Iowa Senator Joni Ernst, giving the Republican response, called for cooperation, too. "There's a lot we can achieve if we work together," she said. But Ernst still disagreed with Obama in many ways.

"We see our neighbors agonize over stagnant wages and lost jobs. We see the hurt caused by canceled health care plans and higher monthly insurance bills," she said. "But when we demanded solutions, too often Washington responded with the same stale mindset that led to failed policies like Obamacare. It's a mindset that gave us political talking points, not serious solutions."

## Relations With Cuba

While the national economy was expected to dominate the president's address, he also promoted two of his recent political actions overseas.

Obama mentioned his decision to normalize the United States' diplomatic relationship with Cuba. He also discussed the need to launch a military campaign against the Islamic State extremist group in Iraq and Syria. In two potential areas of compromise with Republicans, he called on Congress to pass legislation that would promote cyber security and authorize military action in the Middle East.

"I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL," Obama said, referring to the Islamic State group. The extremist group has also been called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). It wants to set up its own country governed by Islamic law..

The centerpiece of the president's address was to be a Democratic tax proposal that could increase the tax rate on investments made by wealthy people. The proposal would also require people who inherit investments like stocks and bonds or cash to pay taxes on them when they are inherited. Lastly, it would slap a fee on roughly 100 of the richest banks in the United States.

Much of the $320 billion in new taxes and fees would be used to to help the middle class. Some families would get a $500 tax credit if two parents are working. Others would get a tax credit for hiring a caretaker for their children. A $60 billion program would make community college free.

## On The Economy

Obama is also asking lawmakers to raise the amount of paid time off for workers. And he's used his presidential powers to lower a mortgage insurance rate to help attract first-time homebuyers.

Yet, Obama's speech wasn't littered with plans for new policies. Instead, he spoke more about the values that underscore his agenda and tried promote a story of economic recovery.

Indeed, the economy is doing better than it has at any other time during Obama's presidency. Growth is on the upswing and fewer than 6 percent of Americans are unemployed. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, said Obama's proposals for building on the economic gains were simply "talking-point proposals designed to excite" Democrats' supporters "but not designed to pass."

McConnell urged Obama to work with Republicans to fix existing government programs, not just propose tax increases. Republicans want to fix Medicare and Social Security, which provide health care and money to retired people. They also seek to balance the budget, so that the government doesn't spend more than it has.

## Guests At Tuesday's Address

Both the White House and Republicans stacked their guest lists for Tuesday's speech with people who put a human face on their policy positions.

Among those scheduled to sit with First Lady Michelle Obama were Chelsey Davis, a student from Tennessee who plans to graduate from a community college in May; Dr. Pranav Shetty, who has been working on the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, and Alan Gross, who was released from a Cuban prison last month as part of Obama's decision to normalize relations with the communist nation.

House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican from Ohio, announced that his guest would be Cuban dissident Jorge Luis García Pérez, who spent 17 years in a Cuban prison for opposing the country's communist government. Florida Republican Senator Macro Rubio brought a well-known Cuban dissident's daughter.

Cuban dissidents, who have opposed the Cuban government, do not approve of Obama's decision to resume relations with Cuba.

Obama wants Congress to lift the decades-long economic trade ban, or embargo, that prevents travel and business with Cuba. However, administration officials say they don't expect the ban to be lifted quickly.

The morning after the State of the Union, Obama was headed to Idaho and Kansas. He is visiting the mostly Republican states to promote his agenda for his seventh year in office.
