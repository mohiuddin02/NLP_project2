BERKELEY, Calif. â€” Ann Kwong grew up blind. The closest she came to a sport was a marshmallow-eating contest. Judith Lung, another blind woman, never learned how to throw a ball.

Now she can.

Right now, very few blind people play on college sports teams. The University of California, Berkeley, hopes to change that. This fall, it started the first goalball team in the country. Goalball is a rough game.

## The Bells Of The Ball

The game is played with a rubber ball with bells inside. All players wear dark eyeshades and can see nothing during the game. They rely on sound, touch and hearing to get the ball into the goal. The court lines are marked by wires covered in tape. This lets players feel where they are.

Goalball fans hope blind people will be treated fairly in sports. In 1972, Congress passed the Title IX law. It said women and girls have to be treated fairly in school sports. The goalball fans hope there will be a law like it for disabled people.

At one goalball game, a referee reminded everyone to be quiet. Silence is an important rule. The athletes need to be able to hear what is happening on the court since they cannot see.

The referee rolled the ball to the team's star, Will Slason. He whipped the ball to the other end of the court. Jessica Adams slid on the floor to block the ball from going into the goal. It hit her in the chest with a thump.

## Blinders Make It Fair

Adams is the only player on the goalball team with full vision. Each team can have one player who is not blind. They wear dark glasses too.

"For sure, the first time you play it's scary," Adams said.

Players wear pads to protect them from all the diving and sliding in the game. They don't wear face masks. They learn to guard their faces with their arms during games.

If they do not pay attention, they can get a bloody nose.

People think blind people can be hurt easily, Kwong said. That "isn't the case at all."

The team also has an adorable service dog, Van Dyke, who wears a team uniform. Goallball was invented after World War II for soldiers who were hurt in the war. The best goalball players throw the ball at up to 50 miles per hour.

## Other Teams Needed

Besides Berkeley, two other universities have started building their own goallball teams.

Matt Grigorieff is a student at the university. He began the Athletics for All program. It gets people with disabilities into different kinds of sports.

Grigorieff dreams that one day there will be a university league for sports like goalball. Athletes would include people with and without disabilities.

"We're showing that it can be done," he said.
