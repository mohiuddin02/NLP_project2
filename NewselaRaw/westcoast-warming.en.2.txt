SAN JOSE, Calif. — The ocean off the U.S. West Coast has been unusually warm this year, bringing to the area some strange species from waters far away.

Hawaiian ono fish are swimming off the California coast. And a green sea turtle usually at home off the Galapagos Islands was seen floating near San Francisco.

The Pacific Ocean off the West Coast has warmed to historic levels because of changes in wind patterns this fall. The warmer-than-usual water has drawn in warm-water species.

Temperatures off the California coast are currently 5 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than historic averages for this time of year. It's the warmest autumn in 30 years.

## Don't Blame El Niño

"It's not bathtub temperature," said Nate Mantua, a scientist in Santa Cruz, "but it is swimmable on a sunny day."

In mid-October, it was 65 degrees off the Farallon Islands and 69 degrees near Santa Barbara. In most years, water temperatures in those areas would be in the high 50s or low 60s.

The last time the ocean off California was this warm was in 1983 and 1997. They were both strong El Niño years that brought drenching winter rains to the West Coast.

But El Niño isn't driving this year's warm-water spike, which began in mid-July, experts say. Climate change isn't driving it either.

What's happening is winds that normally blow from the north, and trap warm water closer to the equator, have slackened since the summer. That's allowed the warm water to move north.

## "If The Wind Doesn't Blow"

In most years, the winds also help push ocean surface waters, churning up cold water from down below. That process, called upwelling, isn't happening as much this year.

"If the wind doesn't blow, there's no cooling of the water," Mantua said. "It's like the refrigerator fails. The local water warms up from the sun, and is not cooling off."

Mantua said researchers don't know why the winds slacked off. They also don't know when they will start again.

"It's a mystery," he said.

All year, scientists have been forecasting an El Niño. It is an unusual warming of the ocean water at the equator near South America, and affects the weather greatly. Now the water is only slightly warmer than normal at the equator, and scientists say a mild El Niño is on the way.

For people who study the ocean, this fall has been a wonderland.

"It's fascinating," said Eric Sanford, a professor at the University of California, Davis in Bodega Bay. "To see so many southern species in a single year is really a rare event."

## Tropical Fish Wonderland

Sanford and other researchers have spotted more than 100 common dolphins off the Farallon Islands in the past two months. They're normally seen hundreds of miles away, off Southern California.

The scientists have scooped up a tiny species of ocean snail called the tropical sea butterfly, normally found far to the south. They also found a Guadalupe fur seal, normally seen in Mexico.

In September, a fisherman off San Francisco caught an endangered green sea turtle. The turtle is a very rare find for Northern California, since the species usually lives off Mexico and the Galapagos Islands. The fisherman returned it to the sea unharmed.

In Southern California, fishermen and scientists have found Hawaiian ono. They also found tripletail, a fish species commonly found between Costa Rica and Peru.

In August and September there were even sightings of skipjack tuna and giant sunfish off Alaska.

"They are following the water temperature," said H.J. Walker, a museum scientist. He said fish normally turn around when they hit cold water. Now they are able to swim farther north.

## "It Is An Oddball Year"

Over the past week, the water temperature at the Scripps pier in La Jolla was 71 degrees. The historic average back to 1916 for late October is 65 degrees.

In many parts of California, salmon fishing was down. Squid were caught far north, which is unusual.

The ocean changes also have affected birds. Because the wind isn't pushing the surface water as much, less krill and other food has risen from the depths than usual. Fish that usually eat the krill have gone elsewhere. With few fish to eat, birds have difficulty laying eggs successfully.

More common local species are expected to return when waters cool, as they did after the 1983 and 1997 warmings.

"It is an oddball year. But I'm not surprised," said Joe Welsh, who works for the Monterey Bay Aquarium. "These things come and go. There's a lot to learn out there."
