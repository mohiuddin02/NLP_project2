LONG BEACH, Calif. — Many whales swim through the waters off California. Lately, the whales have been bumping into fishermen. They are getting into danger.

This year, more than 60 whales have been caught in fishing ropes. That is a much higher number than usual. Scientists believe the whales may be following their food. The fish they eat are moving closer to shore. The Pacific Ocean is warmer this year. Fish are swimming to different spots than usual. It puts the whales closer to fishermen who catch crabs.

## A Serious Problem

The problem is serious. Crab fishers have begun working with the government and nature groups. They are trying to find out where and how the whales are running into their ropes.

The whales would normally be far away from the shore, said Jim Anderson. He is a crab fisherman, or crabber. The warm water brings whales closer to the beach and the crabs.

Caught whales cannot always free themselves. They can die if not freed. Rescue teams are only able to free a few of them.

## Crabbers Try To Help

The government and crabbers are working together. They want to find out more about the whales. Fishermen are not catching crab yet this year. Green plants in the ocean are making the crabs sick. When crab fishing starts again the crabbers want to help the whales. 

About 100 crabbers had a training class this fall. They learned what to do if a whale gets caught.

When crabbing continues, fishermen will work with scientists. Nature groups are going to help, too.

## Whale Watcher Worried

It is a good start but might not be enough, said David Anderson. He is a captain. He runs whale-watching tours.

Anderson was one of the first people to realize there was a serious whale problem. His boats kept running into caught whales.

The caught whales are only part of the problem, he said. Most of the whales we do not see, he said. It is an even bigger problem.
