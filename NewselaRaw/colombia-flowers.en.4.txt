BOGOTA, Colombia â€” On Valentine's Day, millions of Americans buy red roses. Many of those beautiful flowers come from one place. They are from flower fields in Colombia, a country in South America.

Flowers in the United States were once very expensive. They were sold only at special shops. Today, they are much cheaper and are found in many places. They can be bought in grocery stores and in gas stations.

Colombia had a lot to do with the change. It sells more flowers than any other country in the world except for one. Colombia will ship 500 million flowers for Valentine's Day. Three out of every 4 flowers given on the special day will come from Colombia.

## A Perfect Place To Grow

Edgar Wells was the first Colombian to think about selling flowers to the United States. Wells noticed how expensive flowers were in America. He decided he could make them cheaper.

At the time, most of America's flowers that could be bought in stores came from California and Colorado. They were rare and expensive.

Wells set up a flower company in Colombia. He named it Flores Colombianas. The company made its first shipment to Miami in October 1965.

David Cheever was the next important person in the history of Colombia's flower trade. Cheever was an American college student. In 1967, he wrote a paper which pointed out that Colombia was a perfect place to grow flowers.

Many people read Cheever's paper. One was Colombian John Vaughan. In 1969, Vaughan started growing flowers on a small piece of land.

Cheever soon decided to go into business too. In 1969, he founded his own Colombian flower company. He named it Flor America.

## 4 Million Pounds Of Flowers

The early years were difficult for Colombian flower sellers. Vaughan remembers having to hand-carry boxes of flowers to Miami.

U.S. buyers were difficult to find at first. However, Vaughan eventually convinced grocery stores that they should sell flowers. Grocery stores soon became big buyers of Colombian flowers.

In the early 1970s Flores Colombianas set up an office in Miami. After that, more people started buying its flowers.

The Colombian flower trade has grown a lot since then. In 2013, around 4 million pounds of flowers were shipped from the country.
