MADERA, Calif. — While kids his age were reading Shakespeare and dissecting frogs, Benito Vasquez was picking grapes and almonds in California's Central Valley.

He was 14 when he crossed the border from Mexico, and has worked in the fields ever since. He has never gone to school, and cannot read or write in any language.

Vasquez, now 28, is one of thousands who could be shut out of a landmark federal immigration program. It grants work permits to people who came to this country illegally as children. The new program also puts off the chance of deportation for two years.

He and others like him are missing a key requirement — a high school diploma. They can make it up by enrolling in a class. But just the thought of going back to school is hard to imagine for someone who works long hours, lives in an isolated area, and has had little formal schooling.

## Wrestling With Whether To Apply

"The cream of the crop in terms of educational achievement, all those people applied already, or most of them," said Jesus Martinez, a Fresno-based consultant for the Immigrant Legal Resource Center. "A number of those who haven't applied have educational issues."

Vasquez is still wrestling with the decision of whether to apply.

"I'm thinking about it. Maybe after work, in the evenings," Vasquez said of the English classes that would make him eligible.

Since President Barack Obama's deferred action program began last August, nearly 270,000 young immigrants are now able to work legally. In most states, they can get driver's licenses. But of the estimated 1.3 million people who could be eligible, only a third have applied.

Early applicants tended to be college-educated. Those like Vasquez, who face more obstacles in applying, have remained on the sidelines, immigrant rights supporters say.

Some don't realize they are eligible, believing the program is reserved for college students. Others may be afraid to come forward, or are waiting to see if Washington grants a pardon to undocumented immigrants who are already in the United States. The $465 application fee is steep for a minimum-wage worker. And piles of documents are needed to prove that an immigrant has indeed put down roots in the U.S.

## Some Need More Schooling

The greatest challenge may be the educational requirement. Many of those yet to apply are farmworkers, one in three of whom has less than a ninth-grade education. In the Central Valley, as many as half of immigrants may need more schooling to apply for deferred action.

Before deferred action was proposed, there was another plan in Washington to solve the murky status of undocumented immigrants. The DREAM Act was just for immigrants who were brought into the U.S. as children and were in college or on a path to college. These young people, who were called "Dreamers," pushed Obama to come up with his own program after the DREAM Act failed to pass into law.

Obama opened the door for people like Vasquez. He allows them to qualify by enrolling in a general educational development (GED), vocational or English-as-a-second-language (ESL) class. In two years, their status will be up for renewal. They must show that the class has led to a diploma or a better job, or that they are making progress in school.

Education was always a ticket out of the fields for farmworkers. Now it comes with the added benefit of a two-year work permit. But for some, that benefit may be out of reach.

In Madera, the town just outside Fresno where Vasquez lives, the adult school offers ESL classes. For farmworkers in more isolated areas, there are few options. Adult-education budgets have been slashed in recent years, so there are not enough classes to go around.

## The Only Option

While lawmakers in Washington debate an immigration overhaul, deferred action remains the only option for people such as Vasquez. Immigrant rights supporters say they are just as deserving as their peers with diplomas. The program encourages young immigrants to get better educated, but some wonder if anyone thought about some of the obstacles they may face, especially farmworkers.

Some politicians say the education requirements are to ensure the program rewards immigrants making contributions to the country. But Grace Meng thinks they shut out deserving farmworkers. Meng is a researcher at Human Rights Watch. "Kids working for hours under the hot sun are a very good example of making a real contribution," she said.

San Francisco's Immigrant Legal Resource Center is working in the Central Valley. They are spending more than $200,000 in grant money to organize legal workshops in isolated farming communities and match immigrants with adult-education programs.

Two of Vasquez's sisters attended a crowded workshop in Madera earlier this year. They spoke with attorney Barbara Pinto of the legal resource center, for a free consultation.

Angela Vasquez, a community college student who has been blind since birth, was hoping to get a fee waiver because of her disability. Elvira Vasquez dropped out of high school after her son was born. She would take adult high school classes to qualify for deferred action. The sisters were surprised when Pinto told them that their brother Benito, with his lack of formal education, might also qualify.

By mid-May, Benito Vasquez's better-educated sisters were well on their way to work permits and driver's licenses. And his wife, Maria, was inspired to get her GED, a high school diploma for adults who dropped out.

## Uncertain Path, Uncertain Future

Benito's path is more uncertain. He has yet to register at the adult school. It is hard to find the time for classes after a 10-hour workday.

Benito Vasquez has been working since he was his son Jose's age, harvesting corn and beans on the family farm in Oaxaca. His younger sisters enrolled in school, but the family needed the income from his farm labor.

To get to his job in the grape fields, where he operates tractors and other heavy machinery, he drives without a license. He fears being pulled over by the police. Still, he prefers to take his chances in the United States.

"It's better here than in Mexico," he said in Spanish. "Every week, I get a paycheck. There's more food. Everything's a little easier. If you need something, you just work. In Mexico, when you need something, there are no jobs."
