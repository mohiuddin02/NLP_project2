BALTIMORE, Md. â€” Riots broke out in Baltimore Monday after a black man died in police custody.

The violence first broke out on the city's west side Monday afternoon after the funeral of Freddie Gray. His spine was injured after he was arrested by police on April 12, and he died a week later.

On Tuesday as the sun came up, city workers and citizens began slowly cleaning up the debris. They hauled away the burnt remains of vehicles, swept up shattered glass and put out a massive fire that burned through the night. The rioting following Gray's funeral was the city's worst example of racial violence since 1968, when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated.

Much of the city was shut down, with schools and many offices closed and streets blocked off.

The mayor's office said there were 144 vehicle fires and 15 structure fires. Also, about 200 people were arrested during Monday's violence.

## Police Officers Injured

Baltimore police said 15 officers were hurt. Several of them were being treated in the hospital early Tuesday after they were struck by bricks, stones and glass bottles.

Armed National Guard troops began gathering to keep the peace in Baltimore's neighborhoods, including West Baltimore, the scene of some of the worst violence. At the same time, as many as 5,000 police officers were pouring into the city from other areas. Some of them came from as far away as Washington and Philadelphia.

"What happened last night is not going to happen again," said Maryland Governor Larry Hogan as he toured damaged areas.

Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said public transportation would be up and running. She also said she was working to ensure that most government services operated normally.

Rawlings-Blake spoke Tuesday at a West Baltimore drugstore that had been set on fire. "What happened last night means that more people are struggling."

## Baseball Game Delayed

As of Tuesday morning, no decision had been made about whether a baseball game between the Orioles and the Chicago White Sox would be put off for a second time. It was postponed Monday night because of the violence. The Camden Yards baseball stadium is about five miles away from one of the worst-hit areas. Major League Baseball officials were considering moving the game, possibly to Washington, D.C., if the problems continued.

The streets erupted with violence on Monday afternoon following Gray's funeral service, which was attended by thousands of mourners. No officers have been charged in Gray's death, and police officials have released few details about his arrest. The lack of information has led to concerns among black Baltimore residents about what actually happened. Many black people in Baltimore already mistrust the police.

On Monday, people started throwing rocks in the midafternoon, and by 7:30 p.m. more than 100 people began looting, or stealing from, a local shopping mall. Many of them were teenage boys in hoodies.

Rioters shattered glass windows to get into the mall. Dozens of people flooded in and later left carrying PlayStations, piles of shoes and clothing.

## Helicopters Try To Clear Crowds

Meanwhile, helicopters hovered overhead, with police shouting orders on loudspeakers for people to clear the area.

"This is the first time you see black people getting together," said Dejanaira Hall, 19, a protester who watched as looters raced away with goods. "We don't feel like anyone is on our side."

Police in protective clothing stormed the mall and cleared the area. As they left, violence spread throughout the city and continued on and off through the night.

Arsonists continued to set cars on fire early Tuesday morning, police said in a statement on Twitter.

Also, at least one person was shot, a 51-year-old woman who was hit in the leg near Fulton Avenue.

## Fires Spread Through City

By late Monday, looting and fires spread from one end of the city to the other. Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said that the city didn't have enough officers to maintain control.

"They just outnumbered us and outflanked us," he said. "We needed to have more resources."

The extra officers were expected to arrive late Monday and Tuesday, and Batts said they would help the police regain control of neighborhoods and enforce a weeklong curfew, which would prohibit people from being out at night.

Batts said he was upset by scenes of Baltimore's teenagers looting and burning.

Batts praised one woman who was filmed smacking her teenage son on the head and pulling off his hood. "I wish we had more parents that took charge of their kids out there tonight," he said.

## New U.S. Official Condemns Violence

U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch condemned the violence. Lynch is the first African-American woman to serve as the nation's top law enforcement officer.

She promised to work with community leaders to "protect the security and civil rights of all residents." Justice Department officials were conducting an independent investigation into Gray's death.

Lynch said that people who commit violence to protest Gray's death "do a disservice to his family, to his loved ones." They also hurt "peaceful protesters who are working to improve their community for all its residents," she said.
