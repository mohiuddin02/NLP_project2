GENEVA â€” Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has one week to reveal what kind of chemical weapons his country has and where they are being kept, under a deal struck Saturday by the United States and Russia.

The agreement is aimed at ridding the Middle Eastern country of weapons like poison gas.

It also calls for what one U.S. official called an ambitious timeline for dealing with Syria's chemical weapons. It sets a November deadline for eliminating that country's ability to manufacture and mix the chemical weapons. All materials that could be used to make such weapons would have to be destroyed by the middle of next year.

Under the agreement, inspectors from the international body that monitors compliance with chemical weapons bans would have "immediate and unfettered access to inspect any and all sites in Syria." Their initial inspections are to be completed in November.

## U.S. Military Strike Seems Remote

U.S. President Barack Obama welcomed the U.S.-Russian agreement, calling it an "important, concrete step" toward the goal of destroying the weapons. He warned, however, that "if diplomacy fails, the United States remains prepared to act."

But the prospect of a U.S. military strike, which seemed just hours away only two weeks ago, now appears remote. The agreement suggests that a military strike could be authorized "in the event of non-compliance," but that would come only after approval by the U.N. Security Council, where Russia holds a veto. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said such an intervention was off the table for now.

There was no immediate reaction from Syria or Assad. In interviews on Russian television last week, Assad had said Syria would reveal the details of its chemical weapons stockpiles a month after its formal agreement to the Convention on Chemical Weapons, the treaty that bans their existence.

But it seemed unlikely that he would openly resist a timeline agreed to publicly by Russia. Syria gets most of its military weapons from Russia.

Syrian opposition figures decried the agreement. They said it failed to hold Assad accountable for the deaths of hundreds of civilians in chemical weapons attacks. But rebel Gen. Salim Idriss, who heads the U.S.-backed Syrian Military Council, said his group would facilitate the work of inspectors and would hold its fire when inspectors pass through government-held areas where rebels are fighting.

## Rebels Won't Observe Cease-Fire

Idriss said under no circumstances, however, would the rebels observe a general cease-fire.

"In regions under our control, there are no chemical weapons," he said. "I don't know if this will just mean that inspectors will pass through the regions that are under rebel control. We are ready."

Unknown was what the response would be of other rebel groups, including the Nusra Front and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Both are affiliated with al-Qaida and are among the Syrian rebels' most effective fighters.

Magnus Ranstorp, an expert on terrorism at the Swedish Defense College, said that both groups bear no love for the United States, Russia or the United Nations. They could target the chemical weapons control effort, especially rebels from Central Asia and the Caucasus who have fought bitter battles against Russian influence in Chechnya and elsewhere.

"I think this is definitely a risk," he wrote.

The agreement is spelled out in a four-page document. It marks a remarkable development in the 30-month Syrian Civil War in which more than  100,000 people from both sides have been killed and 6.5 million people have been displaced from their homes.

## "Verify, Then Verify"

Until recently, it seemed that the United States and Russia were hopelessly at odds over how the conflict should be resolved.

Only two weeks ago, the United States appeared to be just hours away from sending cruise missiles into Syria in retaliation for an Aug. 21 alleged poison gas attack that killed hundreds of people. Russia was staunchly defending Syria. It insisted that the rebels, not the government, were responsible.

At one point, Russian President Vladimir Putin called U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry a liar, and last week he wrote a column that appeared in the New York Times accusing the United States of violating international law with its Syrian threats.

Yet it took delegations from the two countries just two days to hammer out the agreement. There was little sign of acrimony when the agreement was announced on Saturday.

The agreement itself also suggested that U.S. and Russian officials had shared intelligence with one another during the talks. The agreement says the two sides had agreed on estimates of the size of Assad's chemical weapons stores. One official said the negotiators had concluded that that arsenal consists of about 1,000 tonnes of poison gas. A tonne is a metric measure equal to about 2,200 pounds.

Still, Kerry indicated there was a measure of U.S. mistrust. He recalled President Ronald Reagan's adage "Trust, but verify" in dealing with the Soviet Union. "That's in need of an update," Kerry said, "verify, then verify."
