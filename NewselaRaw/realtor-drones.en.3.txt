BALTIMORE — Real estate agents are always looking for new ways to sell homes. Now they are getting a little help from [drones](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone), the small no-pilot planes.

The agents are using the aircraft to take pictures and videos of homes.

Robert McArtor is an agent with Re/Max Components near Baltimore. He has a drone.

McArtor´s drone looks like a small helicopter that carries a camera mounted on its belly. It can fly around a house and go as high as 50 feet.

It took him more than 20 hours of training to learn to fly the drone, which even crashed a couple of times. His clients have been really impressed with the images, he said.

## There Are Rules To Follow

But the U.S. government does not allow people to use drones to sell things.

The government office that controls U.S. airspace is the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA). It has been working on rules for drones and other small flying machines since 2008.

People can still fly the drones for fun. They can fly the planes up to 400 feet in the air.

Still, groups interested in using drones for business are not sure about what to do.

One group is the National Association of Realtors, which has asked its members to stop using the planes for now. But it has also asked the FAA to try to come out with the rules soon.

The rules were supposed to be finished in 2011. The FAA said it expects to publish the regulations this year.

## More Licenses To Fly More Drones

Less Dorr is the spokesman for the FAA. He said the agency has asked at least 12 people using drones for business to stop. The FAA spends most of its time answering questions about drones.

Dorr said the FAA needs to write safety regulations that will protect people and property. But the rules can´t be too hard to follow. That would make it difficult for the use of drones to grow.

The FAA said that 7,500 commercial drones may have a license to fly by 2018. But other groups said the number of drones flying around will be much higher. Some say sales of the machines may reach 160,000 every year by 2020.

In the Mid-Atlantic region, the number of drones helping sell homes is small. But it is growing.

The MRIS listing service surveyed 1,300 real estate professionals. It found that only 1.3 percent had used drones to sell properties.

But many more agents are thinking about using drones in the next 12 months.

## Their Popularity Is Growing

Andrew Strauch, a vice president at MRIS, said he has seen drones being used to sell properties on the West Coast. He said it could make buying and selling more efficient.

"We're visual people," he said.

The drones are very helpful when real estate agents are selling large properties. Buyers like having a complete view of the area, said Ron Howard, who works for Re/Max Preferred. He hired a company that uses drones to take pictures of a large home he was selling in 2012.

The company is called Elevated Element and offers real estate photo packages starting at $199. Hiring a photographer and a plane is more expensive, costing about $350.

Using a drone is a cheaper alternative to a plane and it allowed for closer images, Howard said. Most of the houses he is selling are in the city. For those houses he uses images found on Google.

Back in Baltimore, McArtor said more agents will need training on how to use the drones. He is working on a safety course he hopes to sell to other agents one day.

He is not worried about the FAA rules. He wishes more people will use the drones in the future to sell all kinds of properties.
