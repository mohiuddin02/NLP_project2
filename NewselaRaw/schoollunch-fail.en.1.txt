What could be healthier for elementary and middle school students than a lunch packed at home? The answer: lunch purchased from the school cafeteria.

In a recent study, researchers observed what 337 kids ate for lunch at a dozen schools in Houston. They published their findings in the journal JAMA Pediatrics. They found that the typical home-packed lunch contained far fewer vegetables, fruit, meat (or meat alternatives) and whole grains than federal nutrition standards advise. Home-packed lunches also included too much salt, soda and dessert.

Since 2012, schools that participate in the National School Lunch Program have had to serve meals that meet the standards set down in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. There is no such requirement for those who fill the lunch boxes and brown bags that children take to school, however.

## Measure For Measure

In Houston, the gaps between the food served at school and the food brought from home were significant:

— School lunches included 2.5 cups of fruit. Elementary school students' home-packed lunches included only 0.33 of a cup of fruit, while middle school students' home-packed lunches included just 0.29 of a cup of fruit.

— School lunches served up 3.75 cups of vegetables. Younger students' packed lunches included a measly 0.07 of a cup of vegetables. Middle schoolers brought only 0.11 of a cup of vegetables.

— Though students should eat at least 4 ounces of whole grains during the midday meal, home-packed lunches for elementary school kids contained only 0.22 of an ounce of whole grains, and those for middle school students had 0.31 of an ounce, on average. The home-packed lunches also fell short on total grains.

— Elementary school lunches included 8 to 10 ounces of meat or a meat alternative. But home lunches had only 1.87 ounces, of which 1.49 ounces were eaten, on average. Middle school kids packed even less, 1.63 ounces, on average, though they ate a little more, 1.59 ounces. Still, they were short of their target of 9 to 10 ounces of meat per day.

Overall, home-packed lunches were missing a lot of essential nutrition. What did they have instead? Among elementary school students, they included 4.43 ounces of sugary drinks, 0.58 of a serving of snack chips and 0.67 of a serving of dessert. In contrast, sugary drinks, chips and dessert are not served in cafeterias that follow the National School Lunch Program guidelines.

## Study's Just Desserts?

Researchers not only looked at what lunches included, but also considered how much of their lunches the students actually ate. Unsurprisingly, dessert was the most popular item in the middle school lunch bags. The researchers found that 101.8 percent of packed desserts were eaten. The figure was higher than 100 percent because some kids got extra dessert from their friends or purchased dessert at the school snack bar. Chips were the second most popular item in packed lunches, with 98.7 percent of those packed being eaten.

Unlike dessert and chips, students left much of their home-packed fruit and veggies uneaten.

Researchers also found that the sodium in home-packed lunches was higher than federal guidelines recommend. Cafeteria lunches sold in elementary schools can't contain more than 640 milligrams (mg) of sodium. Meals that elementary school students brought from home contained 1,110 mg, on average. Cafeteria lunches sold in middle schools can have up to 710 mg of sodium, but lunches brought from home by middle schoolers had 1,003 mg of sodium.

The study contained a lot of bad news about home-packed lunches. There were also some positives, however.

Federal standards recommend that fewer than 10 percent of total calories come from saturated fat. Lunches packed for elementary school students delivered 9.92 percent of their calories in the form of saturated fat. For middle school home-packed lunches, that figure was 9.03 percent.

## Counting Calories

Total calories weren't too bad either. According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, elementary school lunches should contain between 550 and 650 calories. The home-packed lunches observed in the study averaged 661 calories, but because only 85 percent of the food was eaten, only 559 calories actually were consumed. Middle school lunches averaged 616 calories, within the range recommended for middle schoolers.

The study produced several more findings, some of them quite surprising. The lunches packed at home for elementary school students were more expensive than the lunches students could have bought at school, the researchers reported. The total cost of the ingredients in these lunches ranged from 69 cents to $4.78 per meal, with an average of $1.93. The average school lunch would have cost $1.80.

The opposite was true of middle school lunches. The cost of middle school lunches packed at home averaged $1.76, less than the $2.05 that students pay to buy lunch at school.

Researchers also learned that home-packed lunches brought to low-income schools cost more than home-packed lunches brought to middle-income schools. Researchers were surprised by this finding. One would expect students at higher-income schools to pack more expensive lunches. "This is a new finding that warrants more investigation," the researchers wrote.

There may be more studies of packed lunches in the future. Now that schools have improved the quality of lunches they serve, it is time for policymakers to turn their attention to parents and others who pack lunches at home, researchers concluded.

The researchers pointed out that home-packed lunches could have a large effect on student health. Not much research has been done on them, however. Given how many American children are overweight, researchers argue that more attention should be paid to the food packed in their lunch boxes.
