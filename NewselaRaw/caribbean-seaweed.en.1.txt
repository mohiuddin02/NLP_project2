KINGSTON, Jamaica â€” The picture-perfect beaches and turquoise waters that people expect on their visits to the Caribbean are increasingly being fouled. Mats of decaying seaweed that smell like rotten eggs are popping up everywhere. To make things worse, the seaweed piles are attracting sand fleas with a nasty bite.

Clumps of the brownish seaweed known as sargassum have long washed up on Caribbean coastlines. However, researchers say sargassum has been showing up much more frequently in recent years, and in much greater quantities. The 2015 seaweed invasion appears to be a bumper crop. A number of shorelines have been so severely hit that some tourists have canceled summer trips and lawmakers on Tobago have termed it a "natural disaster."

From the Dominican Republic in the north, to Barbados in the east, and Mexico's Caribbean resorts to the west, officials are authorizing emergency money to fund cleanup efforts. Much work will be required to clear the stinking mounds of seaweed. In some cases the sargassum has piled up nearly 10 feet high on beaches. It has choked scenic coves and cut off moored boats.

With the start of the region's high tourism season a few months away, some officials are calling for an emergency meeting of the 15-nation Caribbean Community. They are worried that the worsening seaweed invasion could become a recurring, longterm problem for the globe's most tourism-dependent region.

"This has been the worst year we've seen so far. We really need to have a regional effort on this because this unsightly seaweed could end up affecting the image of the Caribbean," said Christopher James, chairman of the Tobago Hotel and Tourism Association.

## Researchers Unsure Of Cause

There are various ideas about what is causing the seaweed boom that scientists say started in 2011. Some researchers blame warming ocean temperatures and changes in the ocean currents due to climate change. Others believe it is primarily due to an increase in land-based substances washing into the water, including nitrogen-heavy fertilizers and sewage waste.

Seaweed expert Brian Lapointe says sargassum washing up in normal amounts has long been good for the Caribbean. However, severe inflows like those seen lately are harmful. They can cause fish kills, beach fouling, tourism losses and even coastal dead zones.

"Considering that these events have been happening since 2011, this could be the 'new normal.' Time will tell," Lapointe said by email.

The mats of drifting sargassum covered with berry-like sacs have become so numerous in the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean they are even drifting as far away as West Africa. They have been piling up fast along the coasts of both Sierra Leone and Ghana.

## Seaweed Necessary As Marine Habitat

Sargassum gets its name from the Portuguese word for grape. Brownish in color, it is one of a group of simple plants known as algae. Having no real roots, it simply drifts where the currents take it. Sargassum generally blooms in the Sargasso Sea, a 2-million-square-mile body of warm water in the North Atlantic that is home to numerous marine species. Like coral reefs, algae mats are critical for the survival of numerous marine species. Mahi-mahi, tuna, billfish, eels, shrimp, crabs and sea turtles all use the algae to spawn, feed or hide from predators.

However, some scientists believe the sargassum besieging a growing number of beaches may actually be due to blooms in the Atlantic's equatorial region. They speculate that these blooms are being caused by a high flow of fertilizers and sewage waste from South America's Amazon and Orinoco rivers.

"We think this is an ongoing equatorial regional event," said research scientist Jim Franks. "Our research has found no direct connection with the Sargasso Sea."

## Environment, Tourism Both Suffer

Whatever the reason, the massive sargassum flow is becoming a major challenge for tourism-dependent countries. In large doses, the algae harms coastal environments. It even causes the deaths of endangered sea turtle hatchlings after they wriggle out of the sand where their eggs were buried. Cleanup efforts by work crews may also worsen beach erosion.

"We have heard reports of recently hatched sea turtles getting caught in the seaweed. If removal of seaweed involves large machinery, that will also obviously cause impacts to the beaches and the ecosystems there," said Faith Bulger, of the Washington-based Sargasso Sea Commission.

## Millions To Be Spent On Cleanup

Mexican authorities recently said they will spend about $9.1 million and hire 4,600 temporary workers to clean up seaweed mounds accumulating along that country's Caribbean coast. Part of the money will be used to test whether the sargassum can be collected at sea before it reaches shore.

Some tourists in hard-hit areas are trying to prevent their summer vacations from being ruined by the stinking algae.

"The smell of seaweed is terrible, but I'm enjoying the sun," German tourist Oliver Pahlke said during a visit to Cancun, Mexico.

Anne Alma, a Canadian tourist in Barbados, said friends' reports of the rotting seaweed mounds did not discourage her from visiting the Eastern Caribbean island.

"I just wonder where the seaweed is going to go," the Toronto resident said one recent morning. As she watched, yet more of the mats drifted to shore after crews had already trucked away big piles to use as mulch and fertilizers.
