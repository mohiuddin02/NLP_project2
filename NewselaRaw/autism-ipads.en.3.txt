AUSTIN, Texas — Jaime Morin, 9, has autism. The condition has made him unable to talk his entire life. Things have gotten better ever since his mother, Lupe Santander, found out about Zach's Voice. The group provides iPads to autistic children who have trouble talking.

"He can say exactly what he wants with the iPad," says Santander. "When he first figured it out, the look on his face was priceless. We could finally understand him, we didn't have to say 'Yes' or 'No' when he pointed to things."

Because some children with autism cannot talk, the thoughts occupying their heads are unable to come out. That's where the iPad comes in. Through the app of their choice, the children can form sentences by putting together words, which come in the form of buttons and a picture to match the word. Then they play the sentences back for others to hear. The iPad becomes their voice.

This improves "their understanding of the world around them," says teacher Danielle Skala. She has a few students who use iPads in her classroom.

## Life Is Easier With iPad

Zach's Voice became an official group last May. Their mission is to provide iPads to autistic children who have a hard time talking.

Zach's Voice was founded by Abby Whitworth, who named the group after her 7-year-old son. Whitworth was inspired by Zach's experience with the iPad. Before the Apple product, he used DynaVox, a heavy device that was hard to program, Whitworth said. Besides being clunky, it drew attention to him. With an iPad, he blends in.

Whitworth was inspired to form Zach's Voice after seeing something at a grocery store. While shopping, she noticed an autistic child walking around with note cards. He was using the cards as a way to communicate — to express himself — in place of talking. With note cards, however, the number of words a kid can use is limited.

"The iPad lets kids use all the words they want," says Whitworth.

"With picture books and note cards, I got to decide what the kids said," says Skala. "Now, the child decides."

## Families Can Choose Their Favorite App

The app recommended by Zach's Voice is ProLoQuo2Go. However, the group provides a gift card that covers the cost of whatever app families decide to download. Jaime chose Lamp Words for Life, a program he was already familiar with.

ProLoQuo2Go lets kids add words to the program. For example, they can add family members' names or the names of their favorite cartoon characters.

"The kids start off using the app to communicate about the things they love," says Whitworth. "It's rewarding and motivates them to use the program."

Zach's Voice works with teachers to find families who would benefit from the program.

Parents must promise to use the iPad only for the benefit of the autistic child. In addition, no other apps can be downloaded. The idea is that the iPad is to be used to help the kid communicate and for no other purpose. It becomes part of the child's daily life, just as important as wearing shoes when they leave the house.

## Being Heard And Understood With Confidence

The iPad can do more than just help children with autism communicate. It sometimes also can make it easier for them to talk.

"Zach talks now," Whitworth says. "It started six months ago, about a year and a half after he first got his iPad."

Jaime's speech has also expanded since he began using the iPad. He has started to repeat sentences and words after hearing them through the app. When he hears a certain pronunciation, he tries to imitate it.

"It opens up their world, their voice can be heard," Santander says. "He's not stuck in his little body anymore. It has given him confidence."

The iPad also can make kids feel less anxious.

"Being heard and understood," Whitworth says, can be a great "relief for our kids."
