Earthquakes can hurt more people than hurricanes and tornadoes.

They are especially scary because no one knows when an earthquake will happen.

Scientists can say how likely it is that an earthquake will happen.

But they do not yet have the tools to tell when exactly an earthquake will strike.

To learn that, scientists have come up with an exciting plan.

The scientists are drilling deep into the Earth.

They are drilling down to where earthquakes begin.

The scientists are taking samples of rock.

They are also measuring conditions down deep.

These conditions include the temperature and pressure.

If the scientists are lucky, they will catch an earthquake in action.

The Earth's surface is made up of flat plates of rock.

Earthquakes erupt when the plates bang against each other.

These happen at what are called faults.

Earthquakes are some of the worst disasters on the planet.

But scientists cannot warn people.

Early warning would be helpful.

People have just minutes to take cover in an earthquake.

The problem is scientists do not really know how earthquakes begin.

It's hard to find out.

Earthquakes begin miles below the Earth's surface.

People can't go that far down.

Clifford Thurber is a geologist.

Drilling lets scientists measure what's going on, he said.

The scientists are drilling at two dangerous faults.

They are in New Zealand and Japan.

They could cause huge earthquakes at any moment.

Drilling such deep holes is not easy.

It's especially hard to drill under water.

Many of the most dangerous faults are in the ocean.

The scientists also have drilled into the San Andreas fault.

The San Andreas fault is in California.

It has caused many earthquakes.

The scientists had many problems there.

Drilling was expensive.

Also, their tools broke quickly.

The temperatures were too high so far down.

The scientists learned important lessons.

Now they won't drill so deep.

They can also get important information closer to the surface.
