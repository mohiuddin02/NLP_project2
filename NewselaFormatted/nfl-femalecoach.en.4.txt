The Arizona Cardinals football team is getting a new coach.

Her name is Jen Welter.

Jen never dreamed it would be possible.

Coaching is usually a job that only men do in the National Football League.

Now coaching is a dream other women can share.

Jen said girls get the wrong message.

They are told it is important to be pretty.

They are also told to get married.

They sometimes have the wrong idea about success.

Jen wanted to tell girls something important.

When they work hard, girls can do anything.

Michael Bidwill is the team's president.

Jen has the team's full support, he said.

Roger Goodell is the head of the NFL.

He said the Cardinals made the right decision.

Jen grew up in Florida.

She always loved football.

She tells a story about when she was little.

Her family would drag a mattress outside.

Bigger kids would tackle her.

Jen spent 14 years as a football player.

Most of them were with the Dallas Diamonds.

The team is part of a women's football league.

Her first football paycheck came in 2004.

She was paid $12.

That came to $1 for each game she played.

Jen still carries the check around.

She is very proud of it.

It proves she is a pro.

A year ago, she became the first woman to play on a men's football team.

Then she became the first woman coach.

Jen said others may come up with better game plans.

She understands players.

She never quits.

Jen's job is only for six weeks.

She will coach at the team's training camp.

Then she will coach the four preseason games.

Bruce Arians is the Cardinal's coach.

He said the job is the first step to working full-time for the NFL.

That is exactly what Jen wants.
