Claire Dundee is 16 years old.

She is a Girl Scout.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/bball.png"/> It is a Thursday after school.

Claire stands on the edge of a basketball court.

Kids are happily running around.

The court is in the front yard of an apartment building.

Women and children live there.

They are homeless.

The children hardly ever played outside.

Claire is visiting the basketball court for a good reason.

She built it to earn her Girl Scout Gold Award.

It is the group's highest honor.

Claire loves basketball.

She knows a basketball court is not always about basketball.

It is about sharing and becoming a family.

Last spring, she met with officials from Door of Hope.

The group owns the apartments for homeless families.

She asked them what kind of project they needed.

They gave her ideas like building bookcases or planting bushes.

Then one of the workers had a crazy idea.

She could turn one of the building's yards into a basketball court.

Tim Peters is the head of Door of Hope.

He said that the children really needed a safe place to play.

At first, Claire did not think it would be that hard.

It turned out to be more work than she thought.

The court took nearly three weeks to build.

It cost about $25,000\.

Claire raised the money and found someone to build it.

She showed up every day after school.

She checked on everything.

At first, she was scared to phone strangers.

By the end, she told workers where to pour the concrete.

Finally, on Dec. 22, it was finished.

About 12 kids ran to play on their new court.

Watching them was the best part, Claire said.

On Thursday, a woman named Susana looked at her son playing on the court.

Her son is named Jonathan.

He is 11 years old.

Susana said she sees a change in him.

There is a smile on his face.

He can go out and play and just be a kid.

She said, "Who knew a court could be so important?"
