The Islamic State group has vandalized, bulldozed, exploded and stolen from shrines, temples and palaces.

The Islamic State is an extremist group.

It wants to start its own country under Islamic law.

Its fighters have taken over parts of Syria, as well as some of northern and western Iraq.

The Islamic State, along with others, have illegally sold priceless, historic treasures on the world's black market.

Yet in the middle of all the destruction, there is at least one heartwarming story.

A museum in northern Iraq not only rescued a group of looted artifacts from smugglers, but discovered something new.

Ancient History Et Cetera is a news site about archaeology and history.

It recently reported that in 2011, the Sulaymaniyah Museum acquired some 2,600-year-old tablets from a smuggler.

The museum had offered a "no questions asked" policy to smugglers, meaning that it would not ask where they got the artifacts, in the hopes of preventing Iraq's antiquities from leaving its borders.

Here is more from Ancient History: "All of the tablets were, to some degree, still covered with mud.

Some were completely intact, while others were fragmented.

The precise location of their excavation is unknown."

The researchers believe it is likely that they were illegally unearthed from what is known today as the southern part of the Babel - once called Babylon - or Iraq, which was formerly known as Mesopotamia.

Researchers examining the tablets soon realized there was one particularly exciting find.

A broken tablet was carved in cuneiform script, the writing system of the time, with what appeared to be previously unknown lines from the story, the Epic of Gilgamesh.

Some consider the 4,000-year-old Sumerian legend to be humanity's oldest story.

The legend tells of Gilgamesh, the great king of Uruk.

He journeys with his friend Enkidu, a semi-divine wild man, into the Cedar Forest to defeat the ogre Humbaba.

The Epic of Gilgamesh contains many universal themes.

Among them are the arrogance of a hero, the fear of death and even a great flood, survived by a voyager on an ark.

The 20 lines were translated mainly by two experts on ancient Babylon from the School of Oriental and African Studies in London.

Farouk Al-Rawi is a professor in the Department of Languages and Cultures of the Near and Middle East.

The second, Andrew George, had recently translated the story into English.

The 20 uncovered lines offer some new details.

Ancient History describes a few.

Gilgamesh and Enkidu saw monkeys in Cedar Forest.

They were not mentioned in other versions of the Epic.

The forest's guardian, Humbaba, is not an ogre, but a foreign ruler entertained with music at a king's court.

The chatter of monkeys, chorus of cicada and squawking of many kinds of birds made music that entertained Humbaba daily.

There is also a curiously modern touch, as George explained to Live Science.

"Gilgamesh and Enkidu cut down the cedar to take home to Babylonia," George said.

The new tablets have a line that making the forest a wasteland "is a bad thing to have done, and will upset the gods," George said.

Like the description of the forest, this kind of environmental awareness is very rare in ancient poetry, George added.

The Epic of Gilgamesh played an important role in ancient Mesopotamia, called the cradle of civilization, and was passed down over the centuries.

Eventually the ancient Mesopotamian kingdoms disappeared and the story was forgotten.

The story was only rediscovered by European scholars in the 19th century, largely by accident.
