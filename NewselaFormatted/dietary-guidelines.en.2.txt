A few more eggs a week, with a sprinkle of salt, might not be so bad for some people.

But watch the added sugars, especially the sugary drinks.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/SUGAR_INTAKE_Edit.png"/> The Obama administration's new dietary guidelines were released Jan. 7.

The guidelines on sodium, or salt, are not as strict as the last version five years ago.

Still, they say Americans eat too much salt.

The guidelines also reverse earlier advice on the dangers of dietary cholesterol and add strict new advice on sugars.

The administration ignored suggestions from a panel of doctors and nutrition experts who gave advice about what the new guidelines should say.

The experts called for an environmentally friendly diet that was lower in red and processed meats.

They also were not as happy about lean meats on the list of healthy proteins.

The meat industry and some members of Congress did not like this advice, so it was dropped.  But, as in the previous years, the government still says lean meats are part of a healthy eating pattern.

Updated every five years, the guidelines are intended to help Americans prevent disease and obesity.

They cover everything from food package labels to school lunches the government helps pay for to your doctor's advice.

And the main message hasn't changed much over the years: Eat your fruits and vegetables.

Whole grains and seafood, too.

And keep sugar, fats and salt in moderation.

This year, the government has a new message.

It wants people to figure out what type of healthy eating style works for them, while still sticking to the main suggestions.

It is also releasing a slightly different version of its healthy "My Plate" icon to include a new slogan: "My Wins."

"My Plate" is a government resource that helps people choose healthy food groups and portion sizes.

"My Wins" highlights the importance of small changes.

"Small changes can add up to big differences," said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack.

He runs the Agriculture Department, the government agency responsible for food policy.

The department came up with the guidelines along with the Department of Health and Human Services, the government agency responsible for protecting Americans' health.  One new suggestion is that added sugar should be 10 percent of daily calories.

That's about 200 calories a day, or about the amount in one 16-ounce sugary drink.

The suggestion is part of an effort to help consumers understand the difference between added sugars and naturally occurring sugars like those in fruit and milk.

Added sugars are generally considered empty calories, which have no nutritional value.

Sugar-sweetened drinks make up a large portion of those empty calories.

The guidelines say sugary drinks account for nearly half of the added sugars that Americans eat every day.

Americans also need to lower salt intake, according to government health officials who say around 90 percent of people eat too much.

The average person eats 3,400 milligrams of sodium a day, and the guidelines say everyone should lower that amount to 2,300, or about a teaspoon.

Lowering sodium intake was the major push of the 2010 guidelines.

That document recommended that those most at risk of heart disease, or about half the population, lower their intake to 1,500.

The new guidelines drop that suggestion.

Still, they say people with high and borderline high blood pressure could benefit from eating less salt.

For years, doctors have said Americans should not eat too many eggs.

They were afraid it would lead to high levels of cholesterol.

Now, that advice is shifting.

The 2010 guidelines made a key suggestion that Americans consume less than 300 milligrams a day of dietary cholesterol, or about two eggs.

That suggestion is now gone, with recent studies showing little relationship between heart disease and how much dietary cholesterol one eats.

Still, egg lovers aren't completely off the hook.

The guidelines also suggest "individuals should eat as little dietary cholesterol as possible while consuming a healthy eating pattern."

As in previous years, the report advises limiting saturated fats to 10 percent of total calories.

And while lean meats are promoted, the government does suggest certain populations should reduce their meat intake and eat more vegetables.

Figures included in the report show that males ages 14 to 70 consume more than recommended amounts of meat, eggs and poultry.

Women are more likely to eat the suggested amounts.

The development of this year's guidelines set off a new political debate.

It was fueled by Republican claims that the Obama administration has gone too far in telling people what to eat.

Congress got involved, encouraging the administration to drop suggestions that were based on how they affected the environment.

At one point, Congress also wanted to set new standards for the science the guidelines could use.

That language did not become law, however.

In the end, it was agreed that the guidelines would be "based on significant scientific agreement" and "limited in scope to nutritional and dietary information."
