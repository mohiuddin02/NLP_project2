Most countries aren't keeping up.

A new report shows they are not ready to support the growing numbers of old people.

The report was written by the United Nations and a group that supports rights for old people.

The report ranks how well old people are doing socially and in terms of money.

It looks at 91 countries.

Sweden comes out on top.

Afghanistan is last.

People who stand up for the elderly have warned about this for years.

They say that nations are not working quickly enough to prepare for a population that is aging faster than ever before.

The report backs them up.

There will be more people older than 60 than children younger than 15 by the year 2050.

This has never happened before.

Truong Tien Thao is 65.

He runs a small tea shop on the sidewalk near his home in Hanoi, Vietnam.

He is very aware that he is hitting old age without a safety net.

So are millions of other people.

He wishes he could retire, but he and his 61-year-old wife need the $50 a month they earn from the shop.

So he wakes up early every day to open the stall at 6 a.m.

He works until 2 p.m. Then his wife takes over until closing.

He and his wife have no insurance.

That would pay for health care if they got sick.

They have no pension, or guaranteed retirement money coming in.

"People at my age should have a rest, but I still have to work to make our ends meet," he says.

"I'm scared of thinking of being sick â€” I don't know how I can pay for the medical care."

Aging is a problem across the world.

The report shows that the fastest aging countries are poorer ones.

Those include Laos, Nicaragua and Vietnam.

All ranked in the bottom half of the index.

The Global AgeWatch Index was created by a support group for the elderly called HelpAge International and the U.N. Population Fund.

The index puts together information from several global agencies.

It looks at income, health, education and employment.

It also looks at how countries treat their old people.

The index was welcomed by elder rights supporters.

They have long complained that not having information has made it hard to raise the issue with governments.

"Unless you measure something, it doesn't really exist in the minds of decision-makers," said John Beard.

He works for the World Health Organization.

The report fits into the picture of aging and what it means to the world.

On one side is the good.

The fact that people are living longer shows health care and nutrition are getting better.

On the other side is the bad.

Older people still aren't guaranteed income, health care and housing in many countries.

One example is Afghanistan.

It offers no pension to people who are not in the government.

So an elderly person like Abdul Wasay struggles.

The former cook and blacksmith is 75.

He spends most of his day trying to sell toothbrushes and toothpaste on a busy street corner.

He makes just $6 a day.

He can only afford to buy meat twice a month.

His family eats mostly potatoes and curried vegetables.

"It's difficult because my knees are weak and I can't really stand for a long time," he says.

"But what can I do?

It's even harder in winter, but I can't afford treatment."

He wants to stop working in three years, but is not sure his children can support him.

He says many older people cannot find work because they are not strong enough to do day labor.

Some resort to begging.

The report says that wealthy nations are in general better prepared for aging than poorer ones.

Sweden makes the top of the list because of its social support, education and health coverage.

The United States comes in eighth.

Marianne Blomberg is an 80-year-old who lives in Stockholm.

She praises Sweden's health care.

But aging has challenges even in a country like Sweden.

The government has suggested people continue working beyond 65.

Blomberg says that is okay, but should not be required.

The country also cut taxes sharply for working Swedes.

It only cut them a little for retirees.

"I go to lectures and museums and the theater and those kinds of things, but I probably have to stop that soon because it gets terribly expensive," she says.

"If you want to be active like me, it is hard.

But to sit home and stare at the walls doesn't cost anything."
