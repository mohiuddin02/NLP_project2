RIS, France - Attackers unleashed a coordinated wave of explosions, gunfire and hostage-taking in Paris Friday night that left more than 132 people dead, more than 350 injured and generated scenes of horror.

France declared a state of emergency and secured its borders in response.

Taken together, the assaults represented the deadliest day of attacks in France since World War II and one of the worst terrorist strikes on Western soil since Sept. 11, 2001.

At half a dozen sites across Paris - a soccer stadium, restaurants, a concert hall - the attackers carried out suicide bombings, hurled grenades and shot hostages.

Late into the night and early Saturday morning, heavily armed security forces flooded the streets while panicked residents and tourists sought safety indoors.

Friday was the second time this year that Paris has been a scene of mass murder.

In January, Islamist gunmen attacked the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and a Jewish-owned supermarket, leaving 17 dead.

Charlie Hebdo was targeted because of cartoons it had published depicting the Islamic prophet Muhammad.

The latest violence will only heighten the tension in Europe.

The continent is already on edge from the strain of an unprecedented flow of migrants from the Middle East, southern Asia and Africa.

At the same time, Islamist extremism has been growing, and political disagreements about how Europe should handle the problems facing it have increased.

World leaders rushed to condemn the attacks, and French President Fran√ßois Hollande vowed revenge.

"We are going to lead a war which will be pitiless," Hollande said.

"Because when terrorists are capable of committing such atrocities, they must be certain that they are facing a determined France, a united France, a France that is together and does not let itself be moved, even if today we express infinite sorrow."

Within minutes of the first reports on the violence, Islamic State supporters created Internet hashtags hailing "Paris in flames" and declaring that "ISIS is attacking Paris," the Vocativ website reported.

The Islamic State has been attempting to set up its own country governed by Islamic law.

It has also been called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).

The group's fighters have captured parts of Syria and some of northern and western Iraq.

On Saturday, Islamic State claimed responsibility for the terror attacks, and Hollande went on television to blame the extremist group.

Late on Sunday, France's Defense Ministry said French warplanes had launched a ferocious retaliatory assault on targets in Raqqa, Syria, the Islamic State's de facto capital, after coordinating with U.S. defense officials.

The ministry said 10 aircraft dropped 20 bombs on facilities used by the militant group.

The scale and sophistication of the attacks will likely prompt questions about how the planning for such an operation evaded the scrutiny of French intelligence services.

The Paris prosecutor's office initially announced that all eight of the attackers had been killed - seven of them by detonating explosives.

But on Sunday, French police said six attackers had blown themselves up, one was shot and killed by police, and the eighth was urgently being sought.

The killers targeted sites across the city where tourists and residents had been enjoying a typical Friday night in Paris.

Soccer games, concerts and evening meals were all violently disrupted by the sounds of explosions and gunfire.

The scene of the worst bloodshed was the 19th-century Bataclan concert hall, one of the city's most famous music venues.

Reports said some 1,000 people had gathered there for a show by an American band, Eagles of Death Metal.

As attacks reverberated elsewhere in the city, gunmen stormed the building.

Witnesses said three or four men, clad in black, used assault rifles to kill audience members.

Police surrounded the building and, amid the boom of explosions and rattle of gunfire, moved in.

As they did so, the attackers blew themselves up with explosive belts, police said.

Inside, officers found evidence of a massacre, with at least 100 people dead, said the city's deputy mayor, Patrick Klugman.

Government workers guided survivors of the attack, wrapped in gold-colored heat blankets, down the street to waiting buses.

Several had blood spattered on their clothing.

Some cried.

Most declined to talk to reporters.

At other sites across the city, attacks left dozens more dead.

At the soccer match, terrified fans gathered on the field, having been barred by authorities from leaving after suicide bombers detonated explosives outside the stadium just north of Paris.

The blasts near the stadium prompted authorities to evacuate Hollande, who was among thousands watching a friendly match between France and Germany.

Across Paris, normal city life came to a halt.

Subway lines were shut down and authorities advised residents to stay indoors.

People who had been on the street in areas near the attacks fled in a panic.

"I was outside smoking a cigarette when I saw some people coming towards us saying an attack was going on at the Bataclan," said Charlotte Baudoin, a 29-year-old event manager.

"So everybody ran back inside the restaurant and they locked the doors.

We stayed inside for 50 minutes with the lights off.

Then they told us to leave, but we did not feel safe on the streets."

Hollande went on national television Friday night to announce a state of emergency, including restrictions at French borders and the deployment of the army.

The president's office said 1,500 French troops would hit the streets of Paris to back up police.

The border controls came amid growing signs across Europe that the continent's tradition of free movement is at grave risk.

Despite rules for passport-free travel, Sweden instituted border checks this week to better control the migrant crisis.

Slovenia rolled out razor wire on its border with Croatia.

While the new French border controls were expected to be strict, international airlines and trains were still operating.

In Washington, a somber President Barack Obama offered condolences and U.S. help "to bring these terrorists to justice."

He said the wave of violence was not just an assault on France but "an attack on all of humanity and the universal values we share."
