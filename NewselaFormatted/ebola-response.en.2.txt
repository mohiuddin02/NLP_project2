To slow down the spread of the deadly virus Ebola, the United States and Britain are sending troops and equipment to West Africa.

Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that the outbreak is exceeding its ability to control it.

The military forces will build treatment centers in Liberia and Sierra Leone to help care for victims of the virus.

Ebola is fatal for between 50 percent and 80 percent of the people who get it.

It has killed more than 2,000 people since it was detected in March.

Thousands more could become infected before the worst Ebola outbreak on record is brought under control, the WHO has warned.

The outbreak began in Guinea.

It quickly spread to the other African nations of Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Senegal.

In Liberia, the number of new cases is increasing far faster than the number of hospital beds, the WHO said Monday.

As soon as a new care facility opens, it is immediately filled to overflowing.

"When patients are turned away at Ebola treatment centers, they have no choice but to return to their communities and homes," the WHO said.

There, they spread the disease and infect other people.

Those who care for patients are among those hardest hit by Ebola.

The disease is spread through contact with the organs, blood and other fluids of people sick with Ebola.

In Liberia alone, about 152 health care workers have come down with the virus.

A total of 79 of them have died, according to the WHO.

Liberia is still recovering from years of war.

When the outbreak began, the country had only about one doctor for every 100,000 people.

In contrast, the U.S. has 250 doctors for every 100,000 people, according to the World Bank.

Every time a doctor or nurse gets sick or dies from Ebola, the ability to stop the spread of the disease is significantly reduced, the WHO said.

Humanitarian workers worry that many local and international doctors and nurses are staying away because they are afraid to catch the disease.

This means there aren't enough health workers caring for Ebola patients to slow down the outbreak.

Ebola is part of a group of illnesses called viral hemorrhagic fevers.

These all interfere with the blood's ability to clot.

Symptoms of Ebola include fever, weakness, muscle pain and headaches.

The disease can cause kidney and liver failure, as well as bleeding inside the body.

There is no vaccine or cure.

In neighboring Sierra Leone, a WHO doctor who was working at one Ebola center tested positive for the virus.

The doctor will be evacuated from the area and sent to a hospital somewhere else, the agency announced Monday.

The doctor was the second international health worker brought by WHO to Sierra Leone, who had become infected.

President Barack Obama said that the U.S. military will help set up isolation units and equipment for health workers.

The health workers have been arriving in West Africa from around the world.

The units will keep Ebola victims isolated to prevent the virus from spreading.

Army Colonel Steve Warren is a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Defense.

He said the troops will build a 25-bed hospital in the Liberian capital of Monrovia to care for health workers.

The military will not be stationed permanently at the center, which will be turned over to the Liberian government once it has been set up.

But the troops will make sure that supplies are maintained at the hospital.

Supplies, like rubber gloves and mattresses, have been stolen from some of the Ebola hospitals.

The troops will also provide the support needed to keep it running for up to 180 days.

Obama said that the U.S. needs to keep Ebola from spreading through Africa and other parts of the world.

If not, "there's the prospect then that the virus mutates, it becomes more easily transmittable, and then it could be a serious danger to the United States," Obama said.

When a virus mutates, its structure changes, making it harder to treat.

British military engineers and medical experts will build and operate a care center near the Sierra Leone capital of Freetown, the British government said.

It will have a total of 62 beds.

Local and international workers will run the center.

It will include a 12-bed center providing specialist care for health workers.

This will "ensure they can continue to respond to the disease as safely and efficiently as possible," it said in a statement.
