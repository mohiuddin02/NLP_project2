<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20140106_DOCTORS.jpg" />WASHINGTON â€” Signing up for insurance was supposed to be the easy part of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.

But many health care experts say the hard part is coming.

There may not be enough doctors and dentists to treat all the new patients.

Some changes could help.

New technologies are being used.

And some health providers who aren't doctors or dentists may be allowed to perform some things usually done by doctors and dentists.

That should allow more people to get health care.

But, it will only happen in the long run.

"In the meantime," said Linda Rosenberg, "people are going to suffer."

She runs the National Council for Behavioral Health.

The government says that nearly one out of every five Americans live in areas with not enough general doctors.

These are doctors who do check-ups but don't usually take care of more specific health problems.

One-sixth live in areas with too few dentists.

And nearly a third are in areas with too few mental health providers.

They care for people having emotional problems.

The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) says something needs to change rapidly.

If not, the United States will have 45,000 too few general doctors by 2020.

There will also be a shortfall of 46,000 specialists.

These are doctors who just treat certain health problems.

One might treat brain problems.

Another might treat skin problems.

In some ways, the lack of providers is worse than the numbers show.

Many general doctors and dentists do not accept Medicaid patients because they get paid less to treat them.

Medicaid is health care coverage for poor people.

It's paid for by the government.

And many of the new patients will be covered through Medicaid.

Many mental health professionals don't accept Medicaid, or any type of health coverage.

About 36 million Americans are expected to gain coverage under Obamacare.

Christiane Mitchell works at the AAMC.

She predicts that many of those 36 million will have long wait times to see doctors close by, or they will have to travel far from home to see them.

There are various reasons for the shortage of doctors.

One big reason is the aging of the baby boomers.

That's the group of Americans born between 1946 and 1964.

That large age group has growing health needs.

It's becoming a problem for health care workers today.

The retirement of many doctors in the boomer age group is making the problem worse.

The government expects the number of doctors will increase a little in the next 10 years.

But the number of Americans over 65 is expected to grow by more than a third.

Money is another reason for the shortfalls.

During their working lives, general doctors earn less than specialists.

Around $3 million less, in fact.

That difference in pay makes becoming a general doctor less appealing for many medical students.

In mental health, much of the work is in government jobs.

Working for the government pays less.

So mental health workers make less than other medical specialists.

For example, the National Council for Behavioral Health says a registered nurse working in mental health earns $42,987 each year.

Yet, the average for nurses is $66,530.

But money is not the main reason that medical students don't want to be general doctors, Mitchell said.

The AAMC has done surveys of medical students.

In those, students valued "work-life balance" more than money when choosing jobs.

Being a general doctor often involves long hours and night and weekend calls.

For many students, that doesn't sound appealing.

Half of the doctors in training are women, Mitchell said.

Many of them want to have children.

So, more of them are looking for a job that doesn't have long hours or weekend calls.

Men are more involved in child care today, she says.

And that affects their choice of jobs too.

Dealing with different types of coverage has scared some students from becoming doctors, said Rosenberg.

Doctors also have to buy pricey equipment.

Then there's the risk of being taken to court when something goes wrong.

Nowadays, Rosenberg said, "the best and the brightest" want jobs in technology or banking, not in medicine.
