Close to 1 million people will descend on San Francisco in early February for festivities related to the Super Bowl football game.

They can see a performance by Alicia Keys, a fireworks display and creations by local artists.

What they won't see much of are homeless people.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/sfhomeless.png"/> In recent weeks, San Francisco has sent workers to the Embarcadero to help the homeless find shelter somewhere other than Super Bowl City.

The free fan village will feature concerts, interactive games and player appearances at the foot of Market Street across from the Ferry Building.

It will be among the main images broadcast of San Francisco.

If the city's plan succeeds, the homeless will head to shelters where they can connect with social services.

"When a lot of cameras are going to be pointed on the city, they want to have an image of the city that does not include poverty," said Jennifer Friedenbach.

She is the executive director at the San Francisco-based Coalition on Homelessness.

They "want to create an illusion that poverty does not exist by removing poor people from the vicinity of the Super Bowl party," she said.

Homelessness in San Francisco is a persistent problem.

It has worsened as a technology boom drawing thousands of well-paid workers has inflated housing costs to some of the highest in the United States.

The city now has the eighth-worst homeless rate in the nation.

Starting Jan. 30, access to the site will be controlled through four airport-style security checkpoints, including bag checks.

The CBS television network will broadcast from the village, which is near a pier where 32-year-old Kathryn Steinle was shot to death last year.

Police have arrested and charged a homeless immigrant in her killing.

David Perry is the Super Bowl host committee's head of public engagement.

There will be more street teams going out to assist people who don't have a place to stay, Perry said at a community meeting.

"San Francisco is also committed to making sure that the experience for Super Bowl is safe, secure and sanitary."

Supervisor Jane Kim said the message she got from Mayor Ed Lee's office is that the city is specifically targeting the site for homeless services because of the Super Bowl.

Kim criticized the city's estimated $5 million cost to provide support, including additional police.

She said taxpayers shouldn't be on the hook for a corporate marketing event.

The game itself will take place Feb. 7 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, a Silicon Valley city about 38 miles south of San Francisco.

"We should be making sure that we're delivering services throughout the city not just because of a special event," Kim said in a phone interview.

She said that the city should provide these services all the time, not just when large numbers of tourists come to town.

Rachael Kagan is a spokeswoman for the city's health department.

She said workers have not encouraged the homeless at the fan village site to leave.

The homeless outreach team staff informed homeless people of the event, Kagan said.

Staffers told them that there will be construction, road closures and crowds, she said.

"It will be very different than usual for the next few weeks, and the team made sure that the people who live there are aware of that."

Christine Falvey is a spokeswoman for Mayor Lee.

She said homeless people are being approached at the festival site with offers of shelter and longer-term housing because of the winter weather.

She explained that the a citywide effort includes adding 1,100 beds at emergency shelters.

Falvey denied the city is specifically targeting the homeless around Justin Herman Plaza, the heart of the future village, because of plans to build Super Bowl City.

"It's associated with cold, wet winter," Falvey said.

"It is dangerous and unhealthy to live on our streets."

Christopher James, 33, sat on the ground next to someone resting in a sleeping bag outside Justin Herman Plaza and asked passersby for spare change.

He said he has not been approached by city officials and even if he were, he doesn't know where he would go.

"Shelters are nasty," James said.

"Eleven years ago, I stayed in a shelter.

It was just a weird feeling."

San Francisco, the 13th-biggest U.S. city by population, had an estimated 6,775 homeless in 2015, with 64 percent living outside of shelters, according to a report from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

San Francisco's public works department collects data about the city.

According to its data, since 2012, public complaints about feces, urine, and other substances and materials have doubled to 16,530\.

Complaints about encampments have quadrupled to 3,509.

Nathan Ballard is a spokesman for the Super Bowl host committee.

He said the committee is donating $13 million of the $50 million raised to San Francisco area charities that are mainly aimed at alleviating poverty.

Jackie Jenks is the executive director of San Francisco-based Hospitality House, which runs a shelter that can house 30 men.

She said there are 500 to 700 people on the waiting list for shelter at any given time.

"We are definitely in favor of any new place where we can get folks off the street," she said.

The Carolina Panthers will play the Denver Broncos on Super Bowl Sunday.
