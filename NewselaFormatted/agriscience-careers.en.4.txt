Valerie Lantigua worked on her laptop in school.

A snake sat on the back of her neck.

Valerie did not mind.

She was learning about animals.

Timothy App is Valerie's teacher.

He teaches about veterinary science.

His students learn about all kinds of animals.Â  Other schools nearby have programs like this, too.

They have agriscience classes.

Students learn the science of agriculture.

They learn how to run a farm or take care of animals.

Students learn about different things in the classes.

Some days they learn about animals or food.

They also learn about farming or math.

Valerie wants to be a veterinarian.

She wants to take care of sick animals.

Not many kids want to be farmers today.

Still, the classes can help kids.

They learn to solve problems.

They learn skills they could use in any job.

Timothy said that students should learn about different jobs.

Agriscience can teach students about animals, food and plants.

Someday the kids can be veterinarians, scientists or food experts.

Timothy's class has snakes.

They live in glass tanks in the classroom.

He teaches students about snakes.

Some students have their own animals.

Students keep large animals outside of the school.

Behind the school, two large tortoises live in a pen.

Chickens are kept in a coop.

Three sheep stay in a covered area.

Students have to care for their animals.

They get to school early to feed them.

Students care for the animals on weekends too.

One of the sheep is Valerie's.

She is raising the sheep for a school project.

Valerie is happy that her school teaches agriscience.

She cannot have a sheep at home, and she likes learning about animals.
