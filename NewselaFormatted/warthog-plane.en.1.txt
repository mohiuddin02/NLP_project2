<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20131121_WARTHOG.jpg" />LOS ANGELES — The A-10 Thunderbolt II, a ground-attack plane nicknamed the Warthog, could be the latest aircraft to be killed off as the Pentagon slashes its budget.

The Cold War-era plane has a seven-barrel Gatling gun the size of a Volkswagen Beetle in its nose.

It has a reputation for tearing apart armored vehicles and clearing the way for troops on the ground with its massive rounds of ammunition.

But the ugly looking plane has been in the crosshairs of Pentagon officials in recent years.

The Pentagon, or Department of Defense, is in charge of military spending and the Air Force, Army, Navy and Marines.

The Air Force — better known for aerial dogfights and dropping GPS-guided bombs — would rather invest its money elsewhere.

With billions of dollars in budget cuts and possibly more chops on the way, the military faces tough decisions: keep paying for planes from the past that are known to work, or invest in high-tech 21st-century weapons.

The Pentagon has yet to release its latest budget or officially say that the Warthogs are on a kill list.

But last month, the Air Force said that eliminating the fleet of 326 aircraft would save it about $3.5 billion over five years.

Warthog supporters in Congress rushed to try to stop any additional A-10 retirements until 2021 or later.

Last week, 33 lawmakers wrote a letter to top military officials to express "deep concern" about retiring the A-10.

Last month, Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, blocked the confirmation of the White House nominee for Air Force secretary until she received answers about the plane's fate.

There's even a Facebook group called Save the A-10 that was created in August.

The group has more than 4,000 supporters.

This serves as a preview of the battles to come in an age of budget cuts.

The military says it must slash its older arsenal to save money.

But because these programs support troops and provide thousands of jobs across many states, Congress has always come to their rescue.

The Pentagon already faces budget cuts of $487 billion over 10 years, and now it must cope with the threat of an additional $500 billion in cuts because of forced budget cuts known as sequestration.

The cuts could go into effect automatically if politicians in Washington, D.C., can't agree on how much money the government should spend, and what to spend it on.

Sequestration cuts would reduce Pentagon spending by $52 billion next year.

When it comes to programs such as the A-10, some in Congress feel there are better places to cut.

The Air Force spends millions of dollars on "conferences, air shows and bloated headquarters staffs," the letter to military officials said.

It was written by both Democrats and Republicans.

But major savings — measured in billions rather than millions of dollars — can be made only by cutting an entire fleet, the Air Force has said.

No one calls into question the A-10's success.

The plane is considered one of the best at directly protecting troops on the ground.

Pilots do that by laying down fire on enemy tanks, other vehicles and strongholds with its high-powered Gatling gun.

The A-10 was designed in the 1970s around the gun — the heaviest rotating cannon ever mounted on an aircraft.

Pilots can shoot short bursts that unleash 140 rounds of ammunition in two seconds.

To do so, it must fly low and slow over the battlefield.

As a result, it can get hit by ground fire.

But the plane is designed to keep flying even if parts of the wing or one of its engines has been blown to shreds, while the cockpit is surrounded by a bullet-resistant titanium tub.

The aircraft has been upgraded over the years.

As good as the Warthog is in close-air support, the military says it is limited in what it can do, which is the problem.

The Air Force has said it wants to rid itself of one-mission planes.

Instead, it wants a fleet of aircraft that can blast apart enemies on the ground and in the sky.

The Warthog can't fight other planes in the sky.

It's not stealthy.

It's not supersonic.

The A-10 replacement is the upcoming F-35 fighter jet.

Known as the Joint Strike Fighter, the nearly $400 billion program would pay for 2,400 jets that could be used by the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps.

The idea is that it can take off and land on runways and aircraft carriers, as well as hover like a helicopter.

No single fighter aircraft has had all those capabilities.

And it is expensive.

At $35,200 the F-35's cost per flying hour is twice as much as the A-10's, according to the Government Accountability Office, which looks into government spending.

The F-35 certainly falls under the Air Force's definition of multirole.

That's the problem, said Todd Harrison, a defense analyst in Washington, D.C.

If budgets are going to be cut severely, where are the cuts going to come from: expensive new weapons that can carry out more missions, or aging, less-complex weapons?

The F-35 provides 127,000 jobs in 47 states and Puerto Rico.

Someone is sure to be upset if there's a proposal to buy fewer of the planes, Harrison said.

"Everyone knows there needs to be cuts, but few people in Congress are brave enough to actually make them," he said.

"Bottom line is there are going to be a lot of angry people in Congress — no matter what."
