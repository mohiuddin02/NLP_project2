Americans eat avocados all the time.

They cut avocados up for sandwiches or make guacamole out of them.

Where do all of these avocados come from?

The avocados at your grocery store may have traveled a long way to get there.

Mexico sells the most avocados in the United States.

There are other areas that sell avocados in the U.S. as well.

California, Peru and Chile all sell millions of avocados in the United States.

The more avocados each area sells, the more money it makes.

Colombia, a country in South America, is hoping to get into the American avocado business.

Colombia already grows a lot of avocados.

But Colombian companies are not allowed to sell avocados in the United States.

Soon, that may change.

There are a few things that Colombian companies must do.

First, they need to show that their avocados are grown in the proper way and are safe to eat.

Next, they will have to get permission to sell avocados in the United States.

Getting permission is complicated and can take years.

Still, Colombia may start selling avocados in the United States soon.

It could happen within the next two years.

Selling avocados could make Colombia a lot of money.

Americans love avocados.

They are eating more and more each year.

Avocado sales in the United States have almost doubled in the past 14 years.

The more avocados Americans eat, the more money the avocado companies can make.

There are many different companies selling avocados from different parts of the world.

Mexico sells the most avocados in the United States.

In 2014, it sold 1.3 billion pounds of avocados here.

That means it sold way more than a million avocados.

It sold 282 million pounds of avocados.

Peru sold 144 million pounds and Chile sold 89 million pounds.

Some Colombians think they can sell millions of pounds of avocados, too.

Colombia is not very far from the United States.

It is closer than Peru and Chile are.

It may be able to sell avocados in the U.S. more easily than those countries can.

Colombian companies are still waiting for permission to sell avocados in the United Sates.

In the meantime, the farms have been getting bigger.

From 2008 to 2014, the size of avocado farms in Colombia doubled.

The country may grow up to 42,500 tons of avocados this year.

California and Mexico may not be happy if Colombian avocados become popular.

It could mean less business for them.

However, there is one avocado-growing area that does not have to worry about Colombia.

Florida is the second-largest avocado state in the nation.

It is second only to California.

It is expected to grow about 66 million pounds of avocados this year.

Florida specializes in green avocados.

Green avocados are a different kind of avocado.

Most Americans are used to small dark-skinned avocados.

These are called Haas avocados.

Green avocados are larger.

Their skins stay green, even when they are ripe.

Mary Ostlund works at Brooks Tropicals.

It is the biggest avocado company in Florida.

Ostlund thinks Americans may like having two kinds of avocado from which to choose.

"People are realizing they like to eat more than one kind of avocado," she said.

She added that most grocery stores sell both kinds of avocado.

Ostlund says the green avocado business and the Haas avocado business are different.

Colombian avocados are not likely to hurt Florida's avocado business.

"It's just kind of a separate market," she said.

"I guess we have staked out our own little corner."
