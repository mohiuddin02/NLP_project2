David Fiori is a gold hunter.

He stood in the Kern River.

He looked across the water.

He could not go too far in today.

The river was too deep and too fast.

He knew the river would slow down soon.

"That is where I am going next," David said.

He wants to go deeper into the river.

"This thing will be down to a trickle.

It is going to be amazing."

California is in the third year of a drought.

A drought is when there is no rain.

And 2013 was the driest year since the 1500s.

For farmers, the drought has been very bad.

But for gold hunters, or miners, it has been good.

When the rivers slow down, people can look for gold in them.

Gold prices are high.

A piece of gold that weighs as much as five quarters costs $1,250.

A lot of people are trying to become rich.

About 150 years ago, there was a gold rush in California.

Lots of people moved to California.

They wanted to find gold and get rich.

There was more gold then.

Miners could pick big pieces of gold off the ground.

They called the pieces "nuggets."

Today, it is more like a gold fever than a big gold rush.

People want gold, but there is not a lot of gold.

Nine people stood in the middle of the river.

They were all looking for gold.

"It is not the normal, that is for sure," said Farris Farnsworth.

He knows they look a little crazy.

The miners scooped up mud from the bottom of the river.

They used large metal trays.

First, they sifted the mud.

Then they swirled it with water.

They swirled until they could "see color."

That is what they call tiny flakes of gold.

Miners usually see some gold.

But they almost never find nuggets.

"I (once) found one that big," said Jay O'Dell.

He held up a small pebble.

Today, the gold in his pan will not even pay for gas for the ride home.

But he hopes he will find a big one.

Hope is what brings people back to the river.

"Grab a pan, man, and jump in," Farris said.

"You never know.

You might get you a big old nugget."
