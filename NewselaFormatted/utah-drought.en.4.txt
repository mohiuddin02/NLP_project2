Farmer Neal Briggs lives in Utah.

He can see big mountains near his home.

In the spring, he can see all the snow on the top of the mountains.

The snow turns to water in summer.

It fills lakes and rivers.

It helps water his fields, too.

This year, Utah had its warmest winter in a long time.

There was almost no snow either.

There is not enough water for his farm.

It is like this in many places in the United States right now.

Farmers in Utah have another problem.

Insects are eating their wheat.

These insects normally freeze in the winter.

They did not this year because the winter was warm.

Now, they are eating the fields of wheat.

Briggs and other farmers are fighting the insects by spraying them with bug killer.

Briggs has six children.

He farms with two of his sons.

He has watched streams dry up more each spring.

He is still hopeful.

Many people in Utah need plenty of water.

So they are hoping this year will be wet.

Rain fell in Utah in May.

It fell for two whole days.

Farmer Briggs remembers running outside.

He texted his son on his cellphone as the water rose.

"Yeah!"

his son wrote back.

"Woo-hoo!"

Farming can be hard.

Many things make it hard.

The weather is one.

The cost is another.

Briggs says he still loves living on the farm.

Briggs and his family talk about their lives.

They don't think there will be much water coming from snow on the mountains soon.

They hope for more rain.

They will keep farming.
