What has long been an academic question may soon become a real one: What would the national economy look like with a $15-an-hour minimum wage?

Community activists and politicians see a $15 minimum wage as the antidote to the ills of rising inequality, a way to reduce poverty and spur the overall economy — the system of buying, selling and producing goods and services.

Business owners warn it will tie their hands when the economy slumps, by forcing them to keep paying high wages.

It will drive small employers out of business and lead to millions of people being laid off from work, they say.

An increase to $15 an hour would ripple through the U.S. economy in some unexpected ways that are, generally, not as bad nor as beneficial as each side claims.

The push for a higher minimum wage has gained strength.

Seattle, San Francisco and most recently Los Angeles have adopted a floor of $15 an hour to take effect over the next few years.

That's more than double the current federal minimum-wage law of $7.25.

No states or cities can pay less than that.

Other cities such as Chicago, Oakland, California, and Washington, D.C., have raised the minimum wage, but not as much.

At least a dozen other cities and states, including New York and Oregon, may soon follow.

The recent movement is rooted in years of flat wages and a general discontent with the economy.

A time known as the Great Recession began in 2007.

It was a period when the stock market took a dive and many people lost jobs.

It officially ended in 2009, but the economy has only slowly recovered since then.

Like the Gilded Age in the late 1800s, the last quarter-century has seen fabulous income gains for corporations and individuals at the top, but very little for everybody else.

Higher minimum wages would address some of that inequality, lifting many working Americans from poverty.

Labor Department figures show that almost 60 percent of workers are paid on an hourly basis, instead of a salary.

Out of those hourly workers, 60 percent — some 44 million people —currently make less than $15 an hour.

If the minimum went up to $15 tomorrow, nearly half of those workers would get at least a 50 percent bump in pay.

It's not just teenagers and young adults who work low-paid hourly jobs.

More than 8.4 million people earning less than $10 an hour today are in the prime of their work life, between ages 25 and 54.

About 62 percent of these workers are women, many with children.

Yet the benefits from higher wages for many would need to be weighed against the reduction in government benefits that low-wage workers now receive.

If wages go up, many workers would no longer qualify for government help such as paying for child-care or public aid for food, housing and medicines.

Millions of workers would have more money in their pockets to spend, boosting demand for goods and services.

Yet they would also likely face increased prices.

Retailers, restaurants, child-care centers and other businesses that employ low-wage workers could charge their customers more to make up for their higher labor costs.

When Oakland's minimum wage jumped from $9 an hour to $12.25 in March, residents noticed many stores tacked on a dime or a quarter to an assortment of items.

Creole food caterer David Smith went further, jacking up the price of his dishes by $2 to $3 a plate.

"I had to," says Smith, 35, who has three employees.

Longer term, many low-paid workers could lose their jobs or find fewer openings as employers cut back to cope with the higher wage requirements.

An analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, a federal agency which provides economic studies to Congress, last year calculated that raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, which some lawmakers had proposed, would result in a half-million jobs lost.

At $15 an hour, the hit would likely be in the millions.

"Fifteen dollars still scares me," says Harry Holzer, a Georgetown University economist.

He added that what might be doable in high-priced cities like Seattle and San Francisco could prove more difficult in other areas.

No doubt higher wages will push some struggling companies into bankruptcy, especially smaller ones that barely turn a profit.

Yet other businesses will do just fine, maybe even thrive.

They could see improved output and greater sales generated as weaker rivals fold and consumers with increased wages spend more, thereby pumping more money into the economy.

Some businesses will adapt by outsourcing more.

Others will try to speed up automation and substitute machines for workers, shrinking lower-wage jobs in the process but also adding some higher-paying ones to handle new technologies.

How all of these competing forces play out is anybody's guess.

Yet as the push for higher minimum wages spreads, workers and employers are already beginning to imagine life in a $15-an-hour world.
