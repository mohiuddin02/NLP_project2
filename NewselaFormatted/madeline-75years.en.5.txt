It's Madeline's birthday.

Not the girl, but the book.

"Madeline" is a book by Ludwig Bemelmans.

This children's book follows the adventures of 12 little girls.

Madeline is the main character.

She is the smallest and bravest girl.

"Madeline" was written 75 years ago.

The Chicago Public Library is celebrating.

It will have "Madeline" birthday parties at six libraries.

Books like "Madeline" stick with you.

You don't just read them.

You read them, again and again.

You remember the words after 50 years.

Children's books feel very real.

They feel real even if they have talking animals.

I loved "Wait Till the Moon Is Full."

That is a book about a kid raccoon.

I used to think he really played ball with his friends.

I wanted my daughters to feel this too.

So I read my favorite books to them and I still love them.

Other parents love those books, too.

A friend's husband read "Little House on the Prairie" to their 7-year-old son.

The boy fell asleep.

But the father kept reading.

My children listened  to all my favorites.

We read "Madeline" and "Wait Till the Moon is Full."

They snuggled up to me.

I used to read and snuggle with my mother too.

We also read some of my favorite chapter books.

One of them is "The Phantom Tollbooth."

My husband or I read it to the girls every night.

We took them on travels with Milo.

Milo is the main character.

He is bored.

Then Milo receives a mysterious gift.

It leads him into adventures.

People write new and wonderful children's book all the time.

Kids don't have to read their parents' old books.

But when they do, magic can happen.

You and your parents might love the same book.
