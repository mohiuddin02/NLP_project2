You would never expect to see a zebra in Canada, or a kangaroo in Japan.

That would be pretty surprising.

That is how scientists felt when they saw a gray whale in the Mediterranean Sea in 2010.

Grey whales normally live in the Pacific Ocean.

What was one doing so far from home?  Animals have been showing up in strange places lately. Animals that live in the Pacific Ocean have been appearing in the Atlantic Ocean.

Animals that live in the Atlantic Ocean have been seen in the Pacific.  What is going on?

A group of scientists wanted to find out.

They wrote a paper about the strange pattern.

The paper was released on Nov. 30.

The head scientist's name is Seabird McKeon.

His first name really is Seabird.

How can animals get from the Atlantic to the Pacific?

The scientists came up with an answer.

One way is to go through the Arctic Sea.

The Arctic is one of the coldest places on earth, though.

Because of how cold it is, big parts of the Arctic Ocean are covered in ice. The ice usually keeps animals from moving through the Arctic.  This is starting to change.

The earth is getting warmer.

As the Arctic has warmed up, some of the ice has started melting.

As a result, passageways have opened up in the ice.  The scientists believe that let animals cross through the Arctic.

It is like a bridge has now opened between the Atlantic and the Pacific.

Animals that used to be apart can now mix. Scientists call this mixing "faunal exchange."

Faunal exchange may lead to a lot of changes.

It may even cause problems.

An animal that moves to the Pacific might eat up all of the food there.

It might also eat the other animals, like killer whales do.

At this point, scientists can only wait and see.
