Ryo Hirosawa is blind.

He could not see what was in front of him.

Was it a house, a car, a fence, a tree or open space?

Ryo pushed the tip of his tongue to the top of his mouth.

He then made a loud clicking noise.

Its echo came back at him.

Did it sound scattered, as if it hit leaves?

Was it bouncing off a solid wall?

Was it hitting many different objects?

Ryo kept clicking.

He began to see a picture in his mind.

He saw a tall tree.

Behind it was a house.

Ryo was right.

This quiet street is the home of World Access for the Blind.

It teaches blind people to find their way with tongue clicks.

Its students listen to the click's echo to know where they are.

Bats and dolphins also send out noises to find their way around.

Daniel Kish started the group in 2011.

When he was small, he began clicking his tongue.

Many blind children often do this.

Some parents worry that their child might sound strange.

Daniel's mother and father supported him.

He rode bikes and climbed trees.

Daniel was 11 when he understood how the clicking was helping.

A friend pointed out that he was doing what bats do.

Daniel's team teaches blind people around the world.

They have traveled to 34 countries.

Brandon Shin came to Kish for help two years ago.

He is 17.

Now Brandon clicks all the time.

He even goes hiking by himself.

He says some kids at school made fun of him.

Others have been really interested.

Brandon's father is named Michael Shin.

He watches his son get around.

It is as though he could see.

Now Brandon feels proud of himself.

He also has courage.

Brandon's parents are proud of him.
