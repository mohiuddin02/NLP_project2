Would you like to help solve a mystery?

In fact, would you like to help solve the biggest property theft in U.S. history?

Keep your eyes peeled for some priceless paintings.

On Monday, FBI agents asked the public to help them find some rare artworks.

They were stolen from a museum 23 years ago.

No one has seen them since.

Investigators also announced a $5 million reward.

This will be given to anyone who can help find the missing art.

The stolen pictures were painted by important artists.

Their work is very rare and worth a lot of money.

On the night of March 18, 1990, two thieves dressed as policemen.

They buzzed the museum's door and demanded to be let in.

Believing they were really the Boston police, the guards opened the door.

The men tied up the security guards.

Then they stole 11 priceless paintings.

One painting is 380 years old.

The thieves also took a model eagle and a Chinese drinking cup.

It took the thieves just 81 minutes to steal $500 million in art.

The FBI has questioned many people about the case.

The investigators were hoping to discover some clues about where the missing paintings could be.

But they did not find very much useful information until recently.

Then there was a big announcement on Monday.

The FBI said it now knows the names of the thieves.

But it still does not know where the missing paintings are.

That is where it needs the public's help.

Special agent Richard DesLauriers told reporters that he was happy the FBI had gotten much closer to finding the stolen art.

He believes that the paintings were transported to Connecticut and Philadelphia after the theft.

But DesLauriers said investigators do not know where the art is now.

The $5 million reward is offered to people with information that could help detectives find the pictures.

Special Agent Geoff Kelly is in charge of the investigation.

He encouraged everyone to think hard.

"It's likely over time someone has seen the art hanging on a wall or stored in an attic.

We want that person to call the FBI," Kelly requested.

Detectives have not revealed the names of the suspects.

Agent DesLauriers said that naming the thieves could hurt the ongoing police work.

It would now be hard to punish the men involved in the theft.

This is because the crime happened such a long time ago.

The police could still charge people who sold the stolen art.

But officers said that they might agree not to arrest people who give them information about the case.

The stolen paintings were cut out of their frames in the museum.

And the empty frames are still on the walls in the gallery in Boston.

Carmen Ortiz, who is a government lawyer, said these blank holes remind her of two things.

The empty frames show the sadness over the loss.

But Ortiz says that the empty frames also represent hope.

They show that the museum is saving a space for the paintings because it believes they will one day be returned.

Ortiz says the main goal is to get the artwork back.

The museum is named after Isabella Gardner.

She was a very rich woman who loved the arts.

She spent 30 years building her art collection.

Her other passion was the Boston Red Sox baseball team.

Nowadays, the museum gives anyone named Isabella free admission to the gallery.

Red Sox fans also get a discount.

She opened the museum in 1903.

On the first night there was a grand party where people ate doughnuts.

Since then, the museum has been open for visitors to appreciate the famous art.

But until these 13 stolen works are found, Gardner's museum will never be complete.
