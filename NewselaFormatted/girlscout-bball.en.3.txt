Claire Dundee stands shyly on the edge of a basketball court.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/bball.png"/> It is a Thursday after school.

A bunch of kids are happily running around the court.

It is in the front yard of an apartment building for women and children who are homeless because of domestic violence.

The 18 children who live in this building rarely play outside because of safety concerns.

This court is their place, where they can run and shout and still be safe.

It has been open only a month, but already it is filled every afternoon with kids.

They play basketball, but they can also talk about their sadness and share their dreams.

Dundee is a Girl Scout.

She is visiting the basketball court because she built it.

"I know, I know," she said with a smile.

She is 16 years old.

"People say, 'You're still a Girl Scout?

Isn't that for second-graders?'"

She built the court to earn her Girl Scout Gold Award.

It is the group's highest honor.

She raised the money, found the builder and worked with the architect.

She even pushed the wheelbarrow.

In the beginning, she was scared to phone strangers.

She would write down what she wanted to say before every call.

By the end, she was telling workers where to pour the concrete.

Dundee always knew that a basketball court was not really about basketball.

"For me, it was about bonding, sharing, becoming a family," she said.

Last spring, she met with officials from Door of Hope.

The group owns the apartments for homeless families.

The officials gave her ideas like building bookcases or planting bushes.

Then one of the workers threw out a completely crazy idea.

If she really wanted to help, she could turn one of the building's yards into a basketball court.

Tim Peters is in charge of Door of Hope.

He said that the children really needed a safe place to play.

He was worried, though, about a teen managing such a big project.

"A lot of people said I was crazy, but I knew something like that would last forever," Dundee said.

And after all, she thought, how hard could it be?

All she had to do was raise some money to buy a goal and some balls.

Then she would find someone to build it, no big deal.

She could surely finish it during the summer, right?

"Pretty soon it became obvious that this was going to be overwhelming," she said.

The project took nearly three weeks and cost about $25,000\.

Dundee showed up every day after school.

She checked on everything, from making sure the ground was level to pouring concrete.

She even pulled weeds and planted bushes.

Finally, on Dec. 22, in a light rain, a dozen kids splashed to their new court.

"It was my favorite part of the project, seeing the kids fight over the balls and run out there and just start shooting," Dundee said.

"I just stood back and watched.

It was really something."

The Door of Hope people were even more impressed.

"It's amazing that a kid can have an idea and end up serving other kids in the community," said Nicole Peters.

She is with Door of Hope.

On Thursday, a woman named Susana said she could see how important the court is to her son Jonathan.

He is 11 years old.

"I can see a smile on his face, a change in him, he can come downstairs and just play and be a kid," she said.

"Who knew a court could be so important?"
