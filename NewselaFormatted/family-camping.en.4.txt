Missouri State Parks has a new program called Learn2 Camp.

The Minter family joined the program.

They spent a day in Weston Bend State Park.

Tessa Minter, 8, and her brother Isaac, 6, did fun things.

Now they are begging to go back.

They want to hunt for bugs again.

They want to roast marshmallows one more time.

They want to sing around a campfire again.

Missouri State Parks would be happy to hear them.

Not so many people buy passes to camp in Missouri's parks nowadays.

Fewer people are spending the night in national parks.

Jeffrey Olson is with the National Park Service.

He said some visitors sleep in motels near parks.

Then they get up and go camping after breakfast, Olson said.

Learn2 Camp helps families who have never camped before.

It brings them to a park for a weekend.

They learn about the outdoors.

They learn to use camping gear.

Families are given lessons.

They are shown how to set up a tent.

They are taught how to cook over a campfire.

Families may find the lessons useful.

It could help them to camp on their own someday.

The program was exactly what Kelly Minter wanted.

Park workers showed her husband Ron Minter how to put up a large tent.

He learned to use sticks to start a fire.

Tessa and Isaac learned to pick out different trees and bugs.

They learned to spot animal tracks.

"I think we might be camping more," Kelly Minter said.

Missouri park officials want children to start camping when they are young.

It could start a new family tradition.

Maybe they can teach their own kids to camp someday.
