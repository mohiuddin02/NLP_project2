The words are sealed in blood and speak of graves and broken bones.

The poetry coming out of the Syrian civil war echoes with memories, bombs and betrayals.

It tells of families torn apart by the war and of boys who resist with rifles.

It is the verse of people who struggle to live among violent madmen and ruined cities.

The poems flow in syllables, beats and rhythms.

Poems are composed by Syrian writers, doctors, mothers and activists.

They are all driven to write about the suffering in their ancestral land.

Poet Amal Kassir summons her grandmother's farm, destroyed by a violent "tyrant," in her poem "My Grandmother's Farm."

_My grandmother knows Syria better than anyone._ _It is the arthritis living in her knees._ _She had a farm whose dust she knew by name._ _â€¦ And the tyrant,_ _The dirt is waiting for him._ _Like the rest of us,_ _He will learn his grave,_ _Feel the weight of the entire country on his chest._ Kassir is a 20-year-old Syrian-American college junior.

Her family left Syria in 2005.

Now Kassir travels the world drawing attention to Syria through rallies and slam poetry performances.

She wears a hijab, a headscarf worn by some Muslim women.

When Kassir reads poetry, her voice sounds both youthful and wise.

The war has "captivated all of my poetry," Kassir said.

For Kassir, poetry is powerful because "you can compare the color of a pomegranate to the color of blood on the ground.

There is color and scent and sound involved."

Years of conflict and human rights abuses have at times silenced her verse.

She could not write for nine months because she felt that "the world had betrayed us."

Since the Syrian revolution began in 2011, more than 200,000 people have been killed.

More than 4 million refugees have left Syria.

At least 7.6 million others are displaced inside Syria.

The war has spun into a confusing game of air strikes, attacks, rebels and Islamic fighters.

The future of Syrian President Bashar Assad is uncertain.

"Poetry is a witness," said Mohja Kahf, an Arab American poet and professor.

She praised the work of Syrian poet Khawla Dunia, an activist.

One of Dunia's poems is called "Sniper."

The speaker describes a moment with a sniper: _This moment which joins us:_ _your eye,_ _a bullet,_ _and me_ _It is this moment, then,_ _that unites us._ _It divides me from my dream_ _and gives you your name,_ _Sniper._ Syria's bars and markets have long echoed of storytellers and poets, including Adonis, regarded as one of the best Arabic poets of the 20th century.

Many writers were persecuted by Assad's government.

Political debate and conversations were muffled until the Arab Spring in 2011, when protesters spoke out against the governments of countries across the Middle East.

"We Syrians had been silenced for a very long time," said Ghada Alatrash, who translates poetry from the war zone into English.

"But in new language since the revolution, something powerful was articulated ...

I saw a lot of courage.

There was nothing to lose."

One of the most powerful voices from Syria is Najat Abdul Samad, a doctor.

In a poem Alatrash translated, Samad writes about feeling weak, but then finding strength in women's ability to deal with difficulty.

"When I am overcome with weakness, I bandage my heart with women's patience in adversities."

The vigor of the revolution's early days, however, has been sapped by years of bombs and death.

Many Syrians feel that their nation has been cut off by the international community and turned into a land of barren fields and wars without clear purpose.

Writing has become "little glimpses" of the disasters "that are taking place on the Syrian ground," said Alatrash.

"Now, it's sons going off to war and not returning.

It's become more real."

This scene comes up in Syrian-American hip-hop artist Omar Offendum's songs.

Offendum's new song, "Crying Shame," speaks to how mind-numbing the war has become: _Now they say Syria's confusing_ _Can't decide which of the sides_ _They really should be choosing_ _Here's a thought:_ _How 'bout you recognize we're all losing_ _And there's nothing civil about a war_ _Where kids are stabbed to death and mothers smothered on a kitchen floor._ Offendum delayed the release of an anti-government song until his family members escaped from Syria.

"I had to hold my tongue for a long time," he said.

"I couldn't release a song like that without their blessing."
