Animal shelters are full of pit bulls.

Pit bulls make up almost half of the dogs that come into Chicago animal shelters.

And they are about two-thirds of the dogs that get put to sleep.

Dogs often get put to sleep if no one adopts them.

The problem is simple.

People keep breeding pit bulls for money.

Owners can't or won't handle them, so they end up being treated badly or put to sleep.

Pit bulls are the name for a group of dogs.

American pit bull terriers, American Staffordshire terriers, and Staffordshire bull terriers are all kinds of pit bulls.

They're known for their strong build and large heads.

Some love them for their sweetness and loyalty.

But others fear them.

The number of pets at shelters or being put to sleep has been going down for other kinds of animals.

But the number of pit bulls impounded has gone up.

So has the number put to sleep.

Pit bulls are seemingly everywhere.

They're for sale on eBay for up to $1,000 each.

They can be found at pet stores, and in parking lots.

In Chicago, pit bull mixes bite people more than other dogs.

By far.

Some owners have to give up the dogs.

Other owners say they lost their home or lost a job.

They say they can't pay for them.

A lot of apartment buildings won't let people have pit bulls.

"The problem is, people don't want them after they're a year old," said Susan Elliot.

She is the head of an animal shelter.

She said they're not as pretty then.

People find that taking care of dogs is a lot of work.

They get lazy and they complain the dog wants to play too much.

"They're wonderful dogs in the right hands," she said.
