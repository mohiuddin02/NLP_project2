Peter Zucca got cancer before his first birthday.

He almost died.

Now he is 12 years old.

Peter wants to make life easier for other children like him.

He knows what it is like to live with cancer.

Sick youngsters at a hospital for children wanted little wagons.

They liked them better than wheelchairs.

The hospital did not have enough.

Peter helped to get the money to buy more.

He was given strong medicines to treat his cancer.

Because of that he lost his hearing.

Peter saw that most books about children losing their hearing "are really bad."

He decided to write one.

It is called "Peter Learns to Listen."

His book offers tips to children who have problems hearing.

He wrote: "Make sure to get the right (ear) molds.

Or they'll fall out when you hang upside down in a tree."

Peter knows how children with cancer feel.

He lost most of his right leg to cancer.

It does not stop him from doing what he wants.

Peter has run a race.

He swims and dives.

He dreams of playing baseball in the major leagues.

As a 10-month-old boy, Peter got cancer.

It was in his legs and lungs.

Doctors gave him two months to live.

Many months later, a doctor cut out the cancer.

By Christmas Eve of 2008, the cancer was gone.

Sadly, it was not over.

After a few years another cancer grew on his leg.

The choice was clear.

Lose the leg, or lose the boy.

Peter's leg was cut off.

Peter writes: "For a while after that, I was sad most of the time."

He turned to helping others.

He started the Peter Powerhouse Foundation a year ago.

His Peter Powerhouse Foundation has raised thousands of dollars.

The money bought 100 wagons for the children's hospital.

Peter is hoping to raise even more money to help children.
