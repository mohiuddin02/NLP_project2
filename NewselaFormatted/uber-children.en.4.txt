Parents may send their kids to school a new way this year.

More parents are using companies like Uber and Lyft.

The companies offer what are called ride-hailing services.

They let people use an app on a cellphone to get a ride.

Many people use these companies.

Parents use them to get their kids to school.

Parents also need to get kids to practices after school.

New companies have started just to drive children.

The ride-hailing business has grown fast.

Uber and Lyft are the biggest companies.

Uber and Lyft do not let children ride alone.

It is against their rules.

Some parents do not follow those rules.

They send their kids alone anyway.

Uber has started a new service.

It is called uberFAMILY.

UberFAMILY charges an extra $10 for a car with a child's car seat.

Uber said UberFAMILY is not for children traveling alone.

Several new companies offer rides to children.

One is called HopSkipDrive.

Another is called Shuddle.

Most of their drivers are women.

The drivers do not just drive.

They also take care of the children.

The companies try to make parents comfortable with putting their kids in cars with strangers.

They make sure the drivers are safe.

They give parents apps to check on where the cars are.

The drivers have special training.

They can sign kids out of school.

They can help kids check in at after-school activities.

The new companies charge more than Uber or Lyft.

The extra cost is for the extra safety.

It is also for the extra things the drivers do.

Joanna McFarland runs HopSkipDrive.

Joanna and two other moms started the company in March.

They were having trouble getting their own kids to all of their activities.

HopSkipDrive gives rides to children ages 7 and older.

It operates in California.

Almost all of HopSkipDrive's drivers are women.

The drivers all have five years or more of child care experience.

HopSkipDrive and Shuddle expect their first back-to-school season to be busy.

This is good for business.
