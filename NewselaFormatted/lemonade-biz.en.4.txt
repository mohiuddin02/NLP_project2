Mikaila Ulmer is just 10 years old.

She owns her own company.

It is called BeeSweet Lemonade.

BeeSweet is a great business.

A fancy store is now selling Mikaila's lemonade.

In March, Mikaila went on a TV show.

It is called "Shark Tank."

She told a group of people about her company.

One of them gave her $60,000.

The money will let her make BeeSweet even bigger.

Mikaila is giving him part of her company.

She made a sweet deal.

Mikaila started BeeSweet when she was 4.

Her parents wanted her to do something for Lemonade Day.

The day is for kids.

They set up lemonade stands and learn about money.

Last year, Lemonade Day was bigger than ever.

More than 225,000 kids took part.

When Mikaila was 4 years old, two big things happened to her.

First, she got stung by two bees in one week.

"I hated the bees," Mikaila said.

Her parents had her learn about bees.

She learned that bees are important.

Second, her great-grandmother sent her a cookbook.

It had a special recipe for lemonade.

Mikaila wanted to help save the bees.

She also wanted to use her great-grandmother's cookbook.

So she made lemonade.

Her parents always taught her about money.

They said she should save it.

Her parents also taught her to help others.

Mikaila does three things with her money.

She gives money to help honeybees.

She saves money.

She also spends money on fun things like toys and arts and crafts.

Mikaila knows she has to spend money to make lemonade.

She has to buy lemons and sugar.

If Mikaila spends $20, she needs to make at least $21.

"The $1 is called a profit," Mikaila said.

It is money she gets to keep.
