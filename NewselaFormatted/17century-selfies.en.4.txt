All you need is a smartphone to take a selfie.

It is easy.

It used to be much harder.

Four hundred years ago, people also made pictures of themselves.

These selfies were called self-portraits.

The artists used paint and brushes.

They thought long and hard about every detail.

A museum will show these paintings.

The museum is called the Mauritshaus.

It is in the Netherlands, a country in Europe.

People in the Netherlands are called the Dutch.

Artists made the paintings a long time ago.

The Netherlands was very rich 400 years ago.

That time is called the Dutch Golden Age.

Many beautiful paintings were made.

Emilie Gordenker is in charge of the museum.

She said this is the first time a museum has shown self-portraits and selfies.

Yes, you can take selfies in the museum.

The show started October 8.

It ends January 3.

It includes 27 self-portraits.

Some of the artists are famous, like Rembrandt van Rijn.

He painted dozens of pictures of himself.

Other artists are not so famous.

One of them is Huygh Pietersz Voskuyl.

His picture is on the poster for the show.

He painted it in 1638.

He is staring over his right shoulder.

It almost looks like a selfie.

Golden Age artists looked into mirrors to paint themselves.

In the show, giant mirrors are all over.

They reflect the paintings.

A video was made.

It shows how today's selfie takers can make their pictures better.

They can learn from the Dutch artists.

Huygh's painting looks simple.

It shows how painters paid attention to all the details.

He carefully painted his beard and his shirt.

Huygh even painted the wooden wall behind him.

Emilie said he thought a lot about these things.

They show what kind of person Huygh was.

Self-portraits were not just pictures of the artist.

The artists wanted to sell their paintings.

The pictures showed people their beautiful art, said Ariana van Suchtelen.

She is in charge of the show.
