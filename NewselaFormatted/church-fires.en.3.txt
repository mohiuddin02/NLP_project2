In the last 10 days, six black churches have burned down.

Thousands of people are asking the same question.

They want to know who is setting the fires and why?

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20150701_Church_fires.jpg" /> On June 17, nine black people were killed in a church in Charleston, South Carolina.

The man who was charged with their deaths thinks that white people are better than blacks.

He was seen in a photo holding the Confederate flag.

It is a symbol of the Confederacy that fought in the Civil War 150 years ago to keep slavery in America.

After the shootings, the Confederate flag came under criticism.

Leaders of southern states said they may take down the flags at state buildings.

Many stores stopped selling the flags.

Now, many people wonder if the fires are connected to the flag.

Investigators say only two of the fires were set on purpose.

There is no proof that the churches were targeted because they were black.

Also, the government department looking into the fires said they are not connected.

Six church fires within 10 days may not be that unusual.

Still, law enforcement officers are taking a close look at each one.

Some people online say the fires are not accidents.

"Black churches are being set on fire," one person tweeted.

"If the government watched the KKK as hard as they do #BlackLivesMatter, maybe we would know #WhoIsBurningBlackChurches," tweeted another.

The Ku Klux Klan (KKK) is a group that burned black churches in the past.

Each remark was re-tweeted hundreds of times.

NAACP president Cornell William Brooks shares their concerns.

The NAACP stands for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.

It is an important black civil rights group.

Brooks said the NAACP will work with churches and police to make sure that churches and their members are kept safe.

In the 1990s, there was a big rise in church burnings, especially against black churches in the South.

It led to stronger laws against fires that are set on purpose.

A national group examined 827 fires, bombings or attempted bombings at religious buildings between 1995 and 1999.

It found that at least 269 involved black churches.

A total of 185 of them were in the South.

That ugly time remained fresh in the mind of Greeleyville, South Carolina, Mayor Jessie Parker.

On Wednesday, he visited the smoking remains of the city's Mount Zion African Methodist Episcopal Church.

A fire had destroyed the church the night before.

On Wednesday, Parker said that investigators are trying to figure out what caused the fire.

Until then, people need to be patient, he said.

"It gives you an ill feeling," he said.

"It brought back all those old memories."

Twenty years ago, the Ku Klux Klan burned the church.

Church fires happen all the time, says the National Fire Protection Association, which keeps track of fires across the country.

The group said there were as many as five fires at churches each day across America in 2011.

The group also includes funeral homes in their count.

It may sound like a lot, but in 1980 there were many more.

Back then there were about twice the number of fires at religious buildings each day.

Sometimes, the churches are old and not in good repair.

Some churches are hit by lightning.

Also, fires have started by kitchen stoves that were left on at night.

In 2011, there were about five fires set on purpose each week at churches or funeral homes.

Most of the time, teenagers set the fires, which were small, said Marty Ahrens, who works at the Fire Protection Association.

So are the church fires something new or are reporters just paying more attention?

"It's hard to know," Ahrens said, adding that news reports may make the problem worse.

Sometimes, a person will hear about a crime on the news and decide to do the same thing, he said.
