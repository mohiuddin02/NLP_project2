Two musicians got together outside a jail on Wednesday.

Juanes is a musician from Colombia, a country in South America.

John Legend is an American singer.

The jail is in Eloy, Arizona.

It is close to Mexico.

Most of the people in the jail are immigrants. They moved to the United States from another country.

The immigrants in jail had broken immigration laws in the U.S.

They are not allowed to live in the United States.

Outside of the jail, some of their families came to the show.  The performers met immigrants in the jail.

The immigrants were not allowed to see the show.

Juanes said it is unfair that the people in jail cannot be free.

He said music is a way to help them.

The people at the show said U.S. immigration laws are not fair.

The performers want people to know that there is a problem with immigration laws.

The concert was shown on TV.

That way more people can see it.

Juanes played the guitar and John played the piano.

Their stage was a big truck parked across the street from the jail.  The performers each played two songs separately.

Then they played a song together.

Many people sang along.  People in the crowd held large signs and chanted.

Some signs said "Not one more deportation."

When a person is deported, they are sent back to the country they came from.

They are not allowed to immigrate to the United States.

Others said "Si se puede," which is Spanish for "Yes we can."

Most people in Mexico speak Spanish.

Some of the immigrants in jail were from Mexico.

Maria Gomez came to the show.

She said the singers' visit will let immigrants know that people care about them.

Her family came from Mexico.

She said they were in danger there.

They asked the United States to protect them.

Now, her brother is in jail.

Francisca Porchas is part of a group that set up the show.

The group fights against tough immigration laws.

She wanted the show to give the immigrants hope.
