This year, 2 million Islamic faithful will arrive in Saudi Arabia to visit sites important to the founding of Islam and from the life of its prophet Muhammad.

For pilgrims, technological changes will make the hajj experience safer and more comfortable than ever before.

Some traditional Muslim clerics are not happy about one development, however.

A proliferation of smartphones has encouraged young pilgrims to snap photos of themselves.

They are photographing themselves kissing the Grand Mosque's black stone or taking self portraits with other sacred venues in the background.

"Selfie fever has taken pilgrims and visitors to the two holy mosques by storm in recent days," the Arab News observed.

Many scholars and other pilgrims, it said, condemn such "touristy behavior."

Islamic Studies teacher Zahra Mohammad declared that taking a selfie, then posting it on Facebook or other social media was inappropriate.

He said it ruined the spirit of modesty and devotion expected during the hajj.

"Taking such selfies and videos defy the wish of our Prophet," said scholar Sheik Assim al-Hakeem.

Hajj, he said, is supposed to be free of "boasting or showing off."

Scholar Sheik Abdul Razzaq al-Badr said the kingdom's decision to relax a ban on cellphones in the mosques was the source of the problem.

The ban was lifted so that pilgrims could seek help in the event of a crisis.

"It is as though the only purpose of this trip is to take pictures and not worship.

And when they return home they say: 'Come look at me, this is me on Arafat, this is me in Muzdalifah!'"

he said to Arab News.

Still, Saudi engineers and planners are being hailed for introducing new safety features.

In the past, the annual hajj has been marred by serious problems.

Among them have been deadly stampedes, numerous cases of heat stroke and extremist violence.

Under the headline "10 Ways Engineering Rocks the Casbah," the Albawaba website hailed construction and design improvements that will reduce hazards associated with the hajj.

Among them are the extreme crowding that occurs when hundreds of thousands of pilgrims attempt to walk around the mosques' interiors at the same time.

Extreme weather is also often a serious problem.

Pilgrims pray outdoors, uncovered, in temperatures that can exceed 120 degrees Fahrenheit.

To help accommodate large crowds, a courtyard at Mecca's Grand Mosque has been modified.

The mosque is now capable of handling 130,000 people per hour and is accessible to the disabled.

At the Masjid al-Nabawi mosque in Medina, 250 giant inverted "umbrellas" have been installed over the courtyard to shade pilgrims from the withering afternoon sun.

In the outdoor assembly area of the mosque, sliding domes have been installed.

When necessary, they can be used to provide protection from the sun.

The kingdom will also use 60,000 security agents to protect this year's hajj.

Agents will monitor face-recognition software and 1,700 video cameras.

Saudi health officials have also installed two medical screening points at Jidda airport.

They will be used to check arriving African pilgrims for the Ebola virus, to prevent its spread to the hajj sites.

Measures have also been imposed to contain the further spread of Middle East respiratory syndrome.

The disease has killed more than 80 people in Saudi Arabia in the last two years.

For the first time this year too, 300 Indian pilgrims will be provided with free cellphones.

These are loaded with a new app that can translate Arabic and help users navigate the vast sites.

The app will be made available to other countries next year.

People receiving the new cellphones should probably avoid one thing, though â€” using them to take selfies.
