A University of Kansas professor recently discovered what is believed to be the only audio recording of basketball inventor James Naismith.

In the recording, Naismith says the first game he organized 124 years ago was a bit of a disaster.

It was part of a New York radio show called "We the People."

During the 1939 program, Naismith described how he set up the game with two peach baskets at a Massachusetts YMCA school in 1891.

Naismith was given two weeks to create a new indoor activity for his gym class.

His mission was hurried along by a "real New England blizzard" that had students climbing the walls with little to do.

"We tried everything to keep them quiet," Naismith said on the recording.

But the students were bored with a "modified" form of football tried in the gym.

Naismith figured it was time to try his new idea using an "old soccer ball" and two teams of nine players each.

"I told them the idea was to throw the ball into the opposing team's peach basket," he said.

"I blew a whistle and the first game of basketball began."

It did not go smoothly.

Naismith said the players almost immediately started tackling each other â€” and worse.

Two young men suffered black eyes while another was knocked out, and he had to pull players apart, he said.

"I didn't have enough (rules), and that's where I made my big mistake," Naismith said.

Naismith's description of that first game helps explain the process that led him to draft the 13 original rules of the game, Zogry told The Associated Press news agency.

Naismith is believed to have written the new rules shortly after the first game.

Zogry intends to determine the exact timeline with additional research.

"We know ... there was the first game, then there was a second game with the full complement of rules," Zogry said.

The players were nagging Naismith so it sounds like he improved on the rules of the game quickly, Zogry added.

Naismith's grandson, Jim Naismith, first heard his grandfather's voice after Zogry obtained the audio.

He said the recording "changes just about everything that's been written about that first game."

"When he turned those 18 guys loose, obviously they were having a good time, but obviously this was kind of try number 1.

He commented and said he didn't write enough rules.

It came out of that experience," Jim Naismith said in a university news release.

"That makes a lot of sense."

Rob Rains, the author of "James Naismith: The Man Who Invented Basketball," co-written with Naismith's granddaughter Hellen Carpenter, said he did not know of any other audio recording of Naismith.

He said the recording suggests that the game "was modified much more quickly than we first thought."

Zogry said he was surprised when he discovered the audio, and realized it was the only existing recording of Naismith's voice.

The media is everywhere in our lives today so to find a lost form of media and share it with the public is "very exciting," Zogry said.

Naismith worked for 40 years at the University of Kansas and was its first basketball coach.

The school has obtained the 13 original rules and is building a structure to display them on campus.
