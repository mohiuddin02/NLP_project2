The airplane was traveling from Malaysia to China.

There were 239 people on board.

Malaysian Airlines owned the airplane.

It was called Flight 370.

Everything was going smoothly.

Then all at once, the big airplane just disappeared.

No sign of it could be found anywhere.

Flight 370 disappeared more than a year ago.

People are very puzzled.

What could have happened?

Where could the airplane have gone?

Now at last we have a bit of an answer.

A small piece of the airplane has been found.

A part of one wing was spotted on Reunion Island.

Reunion Island is in the Indian Ocean.

The piece that was found is called a wing flap.

It washed up on the beach.

Scientists are studying the wing flap.

If it looks burned, that might show what happened.

The airplane could have caught on fire.

Then it might have blown up.

If the airplane did blow up, what made it happen?

Did someone do it on purpose?

No one knows the answer to those questions.

No one knows for sure what happened to the people on the airplane.

Scientists think no one was flying the airplane after it went missing.

They think it just kept flying on its own.

No one was at the steering wheel.

The airplane ran out of gas.

Then it crashed into the water.

Other people have other ideas.

Some say the airplane was taken over by bad people.

They think those people still have the airplane.

They may want money for it.

What about the wing flap?

Some people say the flap was put on Reunion Island.

The criminals who took the airplane did it, they say.

The criminals wanted to make it look like the airplane fell into the water.

There are many different ideas.

No one knows for sure what happened.

There are still a lot of questions.

The finding of the wing flap is just a first step.

Still, searchers now know for sure where to look.

They will keep looking in the Indian Ocean.

Maybe one day the rest of the airplane will be found.
