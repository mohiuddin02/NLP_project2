Nearby are piles of hard black lava.

A Washington state oyster-farming family built a large shellfish hatchery here.

They are half an ocean away from Seattle.

The hatchery is on a green patch of island below a volcano.

Rising acid levels in the ocean off the Pacific Northwest's coast left the Nisbet family no choice.

Carbon dioxide from burning oil and gasoline made seawater along Washington's coast deadly.

Young Pacific oysters had stopped growing.

The same ocean water got sucked into an Oregon hatchery.

It killed larvae the family had bought to grow oysters from.

So the Nisbets decided they had to move some of their business.

They took out loans and moved half their company 3,000 miles away.

"I was afraid for everything we'd built," founder Dave Nisbet said.

"We had to do something."

Oysters started dying by the billions along the Northwest coast in 2005.

They have been struggling ever since.

Scientists cautiously linked the deaths to falling ocean pH in 2008 and 2009.

But few outside the West Coast's industry believed it.

Lower pH levels mean the water is more acidic.

"I don't care if you think it's the fault of humans or not," Nisbet said.

"If you want to keep your head in the sand, that's up to you.

But the rest of us need to get it together because we're not out of the woods yet on this thing."

About 3,200 people work for the industry in Washington.

It grows one-quarter of the nation's oysters.

No young oysters survived in Willapa Bay at all in 2005.

Farmers blamed bad luck with nature.

But two more years went by with almost no new oysters being born.

Panic set in.

Then things got even worse.

By 2008, oysters were dying at Oregon's Whiskey Creek Hatchery.

I draws water from the Pacific Ocean.

The next year, it struck a Taylor Shellfish hatchery.

It gets its water from Hood Canal.

Whiskey Creek closed for weeks at a time.

Taylor Shellfish lost more than half its oysters.

Growers worried that in a few years they wouldn't have any shellfish to sell at all.

In 2008, Kathleen Nisbet worried about laying off people who had worked for her family since she'd been a baby.

And no one could tell them what was wrong.

Then the oyster growers met the oceanographers.

Dick Feely is an oceanographer, or a scientist who studies the ocean.

He works for the government.

By the early 2000s he was seeing a huge change off the West Coast.

Low pH water was natural when it was hundreds of feet down.

But that acidic water was rising fast toward the surface of the ocean.

Acidic water surfaced off Washington, California and Oregon.

It came from CO2 that entered the sea 20 or 30 years earlier.

It may take 30 to 50 years before the worst of it reaches the surface.

It wasn't until 2012 that Feely and a team from Oregon State University finally showed with certainty that ocean acidification had caused the problem.

By then, the Nisbets had moved on.

They now had a hatchery in Hawaii.

It drew water from a warm saltwater aquifer underground.

The tiny oysters grow until they are big enough to produce shells.

Then they are mailed back to Washington and planted in Willapa Bay.

Kathleen Nisbet has one young son and a baby on the way.

It's been impossible for her not to think about her own next generation.

"I don't think that our government is recognizing that ocean acidification exists," she said.

She also does not think people understand how much it matters.

"They think ocean acidification ... no big deal, it's a huge ocean."

But over the next 10 years the world will have to make significant progress in solving the problem.

"We're living proof," Nisbet said.

"If you ignore it, it's only going to get worse.

Plain and simple: It will get worse."
