Devastated that two white Cleveland police officers will not be charged for killingÂ  Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old African-American boy, social justice activists want to keep their fight alive.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/Cleveland_Police_Shoo_Edit.jpg" /> With that in mind, they have turned to the closest thing northeast Ohio has to a superhuman hero: LeBron James, two-time NBA champion and social commentator.

Last year, James said Tamir Rice's death showed "how much further we still have to go," according to Cleveland.com.

Rice was in possession of a realistic-looking pellet gun when police responded to a 911 call that said there was a "guy with a pistol" in a park.

In 2012, James, along with his Miami Heat teammates, donned a hoodie in honor of Trayvon Martin.

The 17-year-old unarmed African-American teen, was killed in Florida by a Latino man who maintained he was shooting in self-defense.

Martin was wearing a hoodie when he died.

Activists have unleashed a Twitter campaign asking James to put his season on hold until the Department of Justice (DOJ) "imprisons the murderers of Tamir Rice."

The campaign is using the hashtag #NoJusticeNoLebron.

The federal DOJ is investigating the fatal November 2014 shooting.

Some supporters of the campaign cited the successful ouster of former University of Missouri System President Tim Wolfe as an example of the inherent power of athletes to influence change.

Wolfe resigned after university football players went on strike to protest his handling of several racial incidents on campus.

Other supporters have posted videos of iconic heavyweight boxer Muhammad Ali and his refusal in 1967 to be drafted into the U.S. Army.

Ali, who is a Muslim, said it was against his religion.

"Why should they ask me to put on a uniform and go 10,000 miles from home and drop bombs and bullets on brown people in Vietnam while so-called Negro people in Louisville are treated like dogs and denied simple human rights?"

Ali famously asked.

"I ain't got no quarrel with them Viet Cong," he added.

The Viet Cong was the North Vietnamese militant force that fought against the United States Army during the Vietnam War.

James has not responded to the request in public or on Twitter, leading some activists to suggest times have changed.

"We wouldn't have to tweet Muhammad Ali," activist Kwame Rose tweeted.

The effort has split Rice supporters on social media.

Some are questioning whether the request is a fair burden to place on an individual.

After being convicted of evading the draft, Ali was stripped of his heavyweight title, sentenced to five years in prison and banned from the sport for three years.

Although Ali avoided jail time, he was fined $10,000.

If James agrees to bench himself, it might be a powerful symbolic gesture unprecedented for such a famous athlete.

However, James is not facing jail time and sitting out the season would have no influence on the DOJ.

Pointing to the University of Missouri as an example presents problems as well.

Football players, along with other students activists, were able to force the Wolfe's resignation because it hinged upon one man's decision instead of a time-consuming investigation or a legal decision.
