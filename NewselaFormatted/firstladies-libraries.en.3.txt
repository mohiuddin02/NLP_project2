It would seem wrong if he just packed up and threw everything away.

The papers, photos and records of a president's work are interesting to the public and historians alike.

But where does everything get stored?

The answer is at the presidential library.

When a president leaves office, a library is built to preserve everything from his time in the White House that is important to history.

These libraries are open to visitors, allowing people to examine the history of American presidents up close.

Modern presidential libraries are not just concerned with presidents.

The libraries also show the work and lives of presidents' wives, traditionally known as "first ladies."

Exhibits have started to display first ladies' achievements alongside their husbands'.

This recognizes the important work that first ladies do.

It also helps capture the partnership between the president and first lady.

It makes sense that presidential libraries document first ladies' lives and work.

Many of these women actually lead the way in planning and constructing the libraries.

The current first lady, Michelle Obama, is a good example.

As her husband's time in office winds down, she will help plan his library.

There are a number of decisions to be made, and work to be done.

She will work to make sure the library turns out how she and her husband imagine it.

The library will also include records of Michelle Obama's work while she was first lady.

In particular, it will highlight her work in public service.

One of her most famous public service projects is the "Let's Move" program, which helps children with their nutrition and health.

Michelle Obama is not the only first lady to be involved in a presidential library.

First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton is featured in the library of her husband, President Bill Clinton.

An exhibit called "Putting People First" highlights her efforts to improve health care for Americans.

Another exhibit focusing on education includes several awards that she received.

First lady Laura Bush played a big part in planning President George W. Bush's library.

Before she lived at the White House, she was a librarian, so she had a lot of ideas for her husband's library.

She helped choose where it would be built and how it should look.

The history of first ladies and presidential libraries goes back much further.

In fact, it was first lady Sarah Polk who set up the first-ever presidential library.

In 1849, President James Polk left office because of his failing health.

He died soon after, and his wife Sarah collected his papers, paintings and belongings.

She put them in a small room where they could be viewed by the public.

Many other first ladies, including Nancy Reagan, Rosalynn Carter, Betty Ford and Lady Bird Johnson, were involved with their husband's libraries.

Of all the first ladies, Jacqueline Kennedy may have played the largest part in the construction of her husband's library.

President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963.

After his sudden death, the entire job of establishing his library fell to his wife.

She devoted herself to the project.

"She was responsible for fundraising, choosing the architect, developing the exhibits and choosing which of the president's personal objects would go on display," said Carl Sferrazza Anthony, a historian at the National First Ladies' Library.

Today, first ladies are as involved as ever in the planning of presidential libraries.

They are involved in other ways, too.

First ladies have helped presidents shape and talk about their goals.

Some have served as examples of good character for the American people.

Others have fought for a cause they believe in.

Presidential libraries, in other words, are just some of the many projects that first ladies work on.

The libraries, in turn, help us remember their important place in history.
