Ivory comes from elephant tusks.

It is valuable.

People make it into art or jewelry.

Poachers kill elephants to get their tusks.

Someday there could be no more elephants left.

How can they be saved?

Wildlife groups are serious about that question.

The White House and China just made an announcement.

The two countries agreed.

Selling ivory in the United States and China will be banned.

From now on it will not be allowed.

Many people welcomed the news.

Yet they wondered how the ban will work.

They also wondered how soon it will happen.

Peter Knights is the head of WildAid.

His group helps protect animals.

He thinks the ban will help stop poaching.

Some Chinese people like ivory jewelry, art and fancy carvings made of ivory.

Thousands of elephants are killed every year for their tusks.

China buys the most ivory in the world.

The United States is second.

In 2014, President Barack Obama said the United States needed new rules for ivory.

New York and New Jersey both passed laws banning it.

Yet most states have not.

Chinese President Xi Jinping met with President Obama.

Then they agreed.

The two countries will work together.

The United States and China will stop ivory imports and exports.

Ivory cannot be brought into each country or go out.

Hunters cannot bring ivory into the United States, either.

The countries will also teach people about elephants disappearing.

If too many disappear they will become extinct.

No more will be left.

Experts say that the ban will do good.

It probably will not totally stop the ivory trade, though.

Grace Gabriel is with the International Fund for Animal Welfare in Asia.

She said the ban is "a step in the right direction."

Gabriel is glad that President Xi Jinping is involved.

He knows that China is a big part of the problem, she said.

Experts say the ban needs to happen before it is too late to save the elephants.
