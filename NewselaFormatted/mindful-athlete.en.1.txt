Basketball player Vaughn Gray described how his game has improved.

Over the past two seasons, the former forward at George Mason University (GMU) in Virginia found that he was able to "see the game slower" and "react to things more efficiently" during play.

"I felt like I was maximizing my motions, and my playmaking abilities were more heightened through the breathing techniques," Gray said recently.

Where had he learned these techniques?

In several classes he and his teammates had taken in July and August 2013 as part of a GMU study on the possible benefits of a "mindfulness-based intervention."

Mindfulness is defined in the study as "bringing conscious attention to the present moment in a receptive curious manner."

Published last year, the study suggests that approaches incorporating mindfulness may prove more effective for athletes than traditional sports psychology.

However, it is one thing for a group of athletes to be introduced to the ideas underlying mindfulness — and another thing altogether for them to be able to put those ideas to good use.

To help bridge that gap, the GMU study introduced a novel element: yoga.

"We wanted to add yoga because athletes are accustomed to physical exercise," said Fallon Goodman, the researcher who oversaw the study.

She and the others felt yoga would be a nice addition to "the mindfulness intervention, which traditionally is basically talking for 90 minutes."

Goodman's project made use of the Mindfulness-Acceptance-Commitment (MAC) program, which was established by other researchers.

Goodman and the others selected a team and administered the program to them, then compared the results to those of a control group of club athletes from the school.

Both the team and control group filled out extensive questionnaires at the start of a five-week period, and again at the end of it.

However, the control group was left to go about its normal business during the five weeks, while the Patriots basketball team underwent eight 90-minute mindfulness intervention sessions.

Those sessions were each followed by an hour of Hatha yoga, a gentle, basic form of the discipline that emphasizes getting into certain postures and focusing on breathing.

At the end of the five weeks, the team reported "less perceived stress."

Compared with the control group, the basketball players reported greater mindfulness, which was to be expected.

However, they also experienced "greater goal-directed energy" — the ability to purposefully pursue values, both on and off the court, that were in line with what kind of players and people the athletes wanted to be.

The players said they found themselves no longer just reacting to external, often negative, pressures.

At this point, one thing remains unclear: How much of what the players gained should be attributed to the yoga added to the mindfulness program?

Goodman hopes to settle that question later on through another study.

Certainly, Gray found benefits in both classes he took.

"It was good to add the yoga side" to the "mental training," he said.

Gray recently graduated and hopes to play professionally overseas.

Meanwhile, he still does yoga "every once in a while ... because I like the way it loosens my body up."

He prefers to do it in the morning: "It wakes you up mentally, and it kind of focuses you in, gets you kind of centered in your body and your mind."

Jenn Crewalk, who led the yoga sessions, said that she "definitely tailored the class to the existing skill, camaraderie and healthy competitive spirit between them."

"It was really energizing watching a few athletes complete the full expression of a difficult pose, then they all support each other to go for it," Crewalk said.

The Patriots actually went on to have a difficult couple of seasons, as they made the move into a much tougher basketball league, the Atlantic 10.

However, Gray said, "There was never any negativity in the locker room.

We were able to push through adversity.

Even though things may have been rough at the time, when we were losing or whatever, we tried to always stay as a family, because we kind of knew all of each other's personal issues" from the mindfulness interventions.

Gray's experiences line up with what Goodman described as the benefits of mindfulness not found with more standard methods.

The psychological skills training traditionally used by sports psychologists encourages athletes to try to control or push away unpleasant thoughts and feelings, she said.

By contrast, the mindfulness method teaches athletes to better understand those negative thoughts and feelings.

Instead of "trying to get rid of that stress, or maybe acting in a way that's not in line with what you want to do," a person can come to terms with the stress in their life through mindfulness, Goodman said.

"By accepting it and becoming more aware of it, the hope is that your behaviors will then be more in line with things you care about."

Goodman was confident that the yoga sessions had helped with that process.

"I mean, you talk about mindfulness, it's hard to explain to someone and to talk about," she said.

"Then you're actually kind of living it, or acting it out with your body, with yoga.

And then, the next step is, translate that into your sport — so what does it look like to be a mindful basketball player?"

In the future, a greater number of Patriots may know what it is like to be mindful in their sports.

Goodman said that, following her study, "a lot of other teams are interested, so I guess that's a sign that something went well."
