There is a difference in the way that people who win and lose the vote for president look.

People who ran for president and lost look mostly healthy.

President Barack Obama's hair has turned gray.

Some days he looks tired.

Being a president can be hard on a person's body.

A new study looked at the way being president changes a person's body.

Sometimes, losing the race for president is better.

Scientists studied how long people live when they are elected to be a head of state. A head of state is a person who has the highest government job in a country.

The president is a head of state.

Being a head of state is a tough job.

The scientists studied information from the last 300 years.

They looked at how long people lived when they won an election.

They also looked at how long people lived when they lost.

The scientists looked at people from different countries.

They learned that people who lose usually live three years longer.

The scientists said that head of state is a hard job.

They thought that the job led to a shorter life.

People who run for office want to win.

Scientists said that winning is not always good.

Winning the job of head of state can make a person look old.  Some people do not think these scientists are right.

One scientist looked at the health of U.S. presidents.

These presidents had won the vote.

He said that many of the presidents lived to be the same age as other men.

Other scientists studied people who have earned prizes.

They looked at movie stars.

They also looked athletes and writers who won prizes.

This study said that prize winners live longer than people who almost won.

They thought that winning led to a longer life.  All of the studies had different results.

Winning and losing might not change how long a person lives.

The newest study was trying to find a pattern.

A pattern might help scientists understand which studies were wrong.

They will have to keep studying.
