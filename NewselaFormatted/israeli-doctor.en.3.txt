Along the way, he stopped to accept a pain pill from one nurse and a high-five from another.

He has been here for a month.

A Syrian government warplane had flown low over his village and dropped a bomb that blew apart his lower limbs.

Both legs had been removed by an overworked Syrian doctor in a cellar.

The next day, the boy's grandmother took him to the Golan Heights border half an hour away.

There she asked the Israeli soldiers on the other side for help.

The civil war in Syria is still raging after nearly three years of fighting.

For some time now, Israel has been quietly providing aid to some of the wounded.

So far, more than 700 Syrians have received treatment.

The effort, which was launched by the Israeli army, has cost about $17 million so far.

It has been praised as a triumph of humanitarianism over politics.

After all, Israel and Syria are bitter foes that have fought three bloody wars.

"We are saving the lives of our enemies," said Col. Tarif Bader, chief medical officer for the Israel Defense Forces Northern Command.

The 9-year-old boy is one of 17 Syrians being treated at Rebecca Sieff Hospital in Safed, a mountain outpost in northern Israel.

Safed is about 5 miles west of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.

It is roughly 25 miles west of the Syrian war zone.

The stream of wounded Syrians has changed the feel in the hospital's wards.

And it has especially altered the lives of its Arabic-speaking staff.

A social worker named Fares was in the hospital last February when the first group of Syrian patients arrived.

An Arab Christian, he was asked to interpret.

Since then, he has worked nearly around the clock.

He has served as a counselor, interpreter and messenger for the more than 300 Syrian patients who have been treated at the hospital.

Fares, who is 36, asked to be identified by only his first name, as he fears he might attract hostility for treating Syrians.

He was in the emergency room when the 9-year-old, a skinny kid with long eyelashes, was brought in.

The boy cried for two days straight.

He is doing better now, thanks in part to the bond he has forged with Fares.

On a recent afternoon, the pair sat together on the floor of the crowded ward for wounded children.

With them was one of the boy's cousins, who also lost a leg in the bomb attack.

Fares played along as the two boys repeatedly bounced a red plastic ball off his head.

The kids hung on him as he talked, grabbing at his big hands.

Most of those treated here are men.

They are assumed to be rebel fighters in the opposition Free Syrian Army or other rebel groups.

Such fighters can't seek medical treatment in Syrian government hospitals.

The men are kept together in two rooms guarded by Israeli soldiers.

"They tell me about fighting," Fares said, "and about killing, also."

Israel's border with Syria has been mostly quiet since the end of the 1973 war.

In that conflict, Syria tried, but failed to take back the Golan Heights.

This territory had been lost to Israel six years earlier.

A United Nations peacekeeping force now patrols the eastern border of the Heights.

On the Israeli-controlled side, everything is peaceful.

Cows graze in pastures, farmers tend to apple orchards and families drive down well-paved streets.

To the east, Syrian government forces loyal to President Bashar Assad battle rebel groups.

Explosions can be heard and clouds of smoke seen from the top of Bental Mountain in the Heights.

Israel has largely remained on the sidelines — except for the medical assistance.

The grandmother of the 9-year-old with no legs said she has only gratitude for the Israelis.

In a few days, she and her grandson will be driven to the border at the east end of the Golan Heights to be dropped off.

He has been fitted with two prosthetic limbs.

These were donated by a Muslim citizen of Safed, who had been approached by Fares.

If all goes well, the boy may be able to walk again.

But he will probably never be able to return to playing soccer, his favorite sport.

When asked what going back will be like, the boy's grandmother threw her hands into the air.

She said she didn't know whether the family had a home to return to.
