Nanasahib Bankar is a farmer and a businessman.

He lives in a small town.

He is 64 years old.

His house does not have a door.

Most of the houses in this town do not have doors.

"This is the way we have always lived," Bankar said.

His door is just a curtain.

People here think that a god keeps them safe.

The god's name is Shani.

He is a Hindu god.

Hinduism is the biggest religion in India.

Many people in India believe in it.

Hindus believe that Shani stops bad things from happening.

They say Shani stops people from stealing.

That is why people do not lock their doors.

Most people do not lock their cars.

There is one bank in town.

It is not locked.

Many people visit the town each day.

They want to know the story of Shani.

They also want to hear the story about the temple.

A temple is where people pray.

Bankar's grandpa told stories about the stone.

The story takes place many years ago.

A large black stone came out of the river.

When people touched the stone, bad things happened.

No one wanted to move the stone.

They were scared.

One night, a farmer dreamed that the stone talked to him.

It said its name was Shani.

It said it was a Hindu god.

The stone said it wanted to stay in town.

The next day, farmers carried the stone away from the river.

Villagers tried to protect the stone by building around it.

This did not work.

The building fell down.

Some of the workers got hurt.

The people decided that Shani should be out in the open.

Then the villagers made their own houses more open.

They took off the doors.

Many people still believe in the story of Shani.

Others are not so sure.

They say people do steal in the town.

But most do not talk about it.

Now the town has a police station.

It has doors, but there are no locks.
