Fourth-graders are better readers than 10 years ago.

But few of them read well.

This is from a report by the Annie E. Casey Foundation.

Fourth-graders have improved over the last 10 years.

More of them are reading at grade level.

But most poor fourth-graders don't read as well as rich ones.

That is a big problem.

And it is getting worse.

The report looks at fourth-graders in 2013 and 2003.

It compares their reading scores.

The scores come from the Nation's Report Card.

The Report Card describes what students know and can do in school.

Fourth-graders became better readers in most places.

In six states, they became worse readers.

In two states, most fourth-graders can't read well.

They are New Mexico and Mississippi.

Laura Speer is an education expert.

She works at the Casey Foundation.

Reading scores tell a lot of about a place, she said.

They can tell how well off it is.

They also predict how educated its workers will be.

Kids who read well by the end of third grade are more likely to go to college.

They are more likely to do better in life.

There is another problem.

Richer kids are often better readers than poorer kids.

In most states, this gap is growing.

In the last 10 years, richer students made quicker progress in reading.

Students from poorer families made slower progress.

Experts say it's important for kids to read well by third grade.

That's when they begin reading to learn.

If kids can't read, they don't learn as much.

They are more likely to drop out of school.

It also may cause other problems.

Ralph Smith is an education expert.

About 30 states are giving kids extra reading help, he said.

In Florida, lawmakers just passed a new law.

Schools with the worst readers must add an extra hour of class.

The new law seems to be working.

Reading scores are getting better.

"We're making progress," Speer said.

The progress just needs to come faster, she added.
