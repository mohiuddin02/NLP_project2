Students taking the SAT college entrance exam will no longer have to write an essay as of 2016.

The change is one of many announced Wednesday.

An optional essay-writing section still will be offered.

Many colleges may tell students to take it and send in the score if they want to get into the school.

The main SAT will be cut to two sections from the current three.

The top score possible will be 1,600.

That was the top score for years before the essay was added.

With the essay section the current top score is 2,400.

The new optional essay test will be graded separately, said the College Board.

The College Board is the company that owns the widely used exam.

The shifts are part of larger effort.

The goal is to make the test reflect more of what students learn in high school and will need in college.

It is also meant to limit the advantages students may gain from expensive private tutoring.

For example, the revised sections in reading will drop their most unusual vocabulary words.

It will instead "focus on words students will use over and over again," said College Board President David Coleman.

The math problems will be more linked to real-life questions.

The new SAT will be more "clear," "focused," and "useful," he said.

The College Board has long argued that coaching does not help students significantly.

But Coleman admitted that many people believe students who can afford tutoring have an advantage.

The College Board is starting a partnership with the online Khan Academy.

It will offer a free series of practice exams and videos about good test-taking practices.

It hopes the free practice exams will help poorer students.

Some experts said the new steps benefit the public interest â€” and the College Board's own self-interest.

There is another test that students can take instead of the SAT to get into college.

It's called the ACT, and it's offered by a different company.

Two years ago, the rival ACT went ahead of the SAT in the number of test takers across the nation.

About 1.6 million students took the SAT last year.

More than 1.7 million took the ACT.

Some students take both.

The new SAT will become more like the ACT.

The rival test has an optional writing section that many colleges require.

The SAT also will switch to the ACT model of grading.

Only correct answers will be counted.

The SAT has subtracted points for wrong answers.

Critics have argued for years about the SAT.

They have said that the SAT is not fair to some poor and minority students.

They also say school grades show more about how a student will do in college.

Some colleges do not make you take any exam.

The new test is more connected to the new [Common Core](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Common%20Core) teaching standards, which test critical thinking and close reading.

Without the essay, the test will take less time.

Many colleges could have a problem with the essay being dropped.

The University of California system is the largest customer of the SAT.

UC administrators 10 years ago pushed for a set of changes to the SAT.

The addition of the essay was one of them.

Stephen Handel works for the UC system.

He said it was too soon to say whether UC will continue to require the essay.

But he said that students have to write essays to get into the UC schools.

The SAT writing sample is just one part of a much wider set of grades and personal achievements.

The SAT essay, he said, "has a place, but a limited place."

Some experts said making the essay optional sends a bad message.

"I'm not sure it is a good signal to kids in schools about the importance of writing," said Katy Murphy.

She is president of the National Association for College Admission Counseling.

In one area, the College Board will be making it harder.

Now test takers are allowed to use calculators for math questions.

But starting in two years, calculators won't be allowed during some of the math testing.

Another change will be that the SAT will start to be offered online.

It has so far only been offered in the traditional paper form.
