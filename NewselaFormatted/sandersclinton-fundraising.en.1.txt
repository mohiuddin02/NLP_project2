Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's position as front-runner in the Democratic presidential primary election received a big jolt recently.

Clinton discovered a new and unexpected weak spot — her campaign finances.

That amount was nearly matched by the $26 million that Senator Bernie Sanders brought in, thanks to small contributions that came in even faster than during President Obama's campaigns.

As the deadline loomed to collect third-quarter donations, Sanders' passionate supporters raced to raise even more money.

It is possible that he might finish the fourth quarter of the year with more cash in the bank than Clinton.

The senator from Vermont has largely avoided wealthy donors and fancy fundraisers.

His ability to compete with Clinton's long-standing donor network could drastically alter the dynamics of the primary contest.

The fundraising totals give a big boost to Sanders, who has been dismissed by many leaders in the Democratic Party as a serious threat to Clinton.

It further weighs down her campaign, which is struggling to deal with the questions about her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.

Clinton campaign officials maintained that they were pleased by her summer fundraising total.

She raised the money from dozens of high-priced finance events and an intense press for online donations.

Aides noted that they are on pace to reach the goal of raising $100 million by the end of the year.

"We are thrilled and grateful for the support of hundreds of thousands of donors across the country," Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said.

"Thanks to our supporters, we are able to meet our goals and build an organization that can mobilize millions of voters to ensure Hillary Clinton is their fighter in the White House."

Advisers to Sanders marveled at the close fundraising totals.

"I think it's remarkable that Bernie Sanders was able to raise almost as much money as Hillary Clinton, particularly given the way he is raising money," said Tad Devine.

He is a veteran Democratic strategist advising Sanders.

Both camps acknowledged the importance of the numbers late Wednesday.

One Sanders supporter tweeted: "There's still time."

Former President Bill Clinton wrote in an evening email to supporters of his wife's campaign: "Will you help elect her by donating $1 before midnight tonight?"

Shortly after midnight, a Sanders aide said the campaign had raised more than $2 million online just that day.

About $500,000 of that came in after 10:30 p.m. Only one other campaign released totals Wednesday, the last day of the fundraising quarter.

Republican contender Ben Carson pulled in at least $20 million, according to a spokesman.

The competition over fundraising totals comes as Sanders has pulled even or taken the lead in polls out of Iowa and New Hampshire.

The two states hold their primaries first.

In all, Clinton has raised $75 million for her 2016 bid, while Sanders has garnered more than $40 million.

Devine said the senator's team thought it needed at least $40 million to compete against Clinton before voting starts.

It has hit that mark months ahead of schedule.

Sanders' campaign said it still has more than $25 million in the bank.

Sanders is running a more thrifty campaign, which has not yet began airing television ads, unlike Clinton.

Sanders is a self-described democratic socialist who favors free health care and college for Americans, and condemns the political influence of the "billionaire class."

He has focused on raising money over the Internet, mostly in small amounts, instead of through rich donors.

By Wednesday evening, his campaign said it had received 1.3 million donations from about 650,000 different donors.

Sanders got to the 1 million mark earlier than did Barack Obama in both his presidential campaigns.

Obama reached 1 million donations in his 2008 campaign in February of that year, and in 2012, Obama's campaign announced it reached the 1 million mark in October 2011.

Unlike Sanders, Obama went after larger donors as well.

Devine said that a big advantage of Sanders' style of raising money is that he can return again and again to the same donors for additional contributions.

Most of them have donated money well under the $2,700 limit on individual contributions.

"They will have enormous headroom to continue to contribute to the campaign," Devine said.

As of June 30, Clinton had more than 250,000 individual contributors, although her campaign declined to share the current figure.

Unlike most other presidential candidates, Sanders has discouraged the support of giant Political Action Committees.

These super PACs are groups that operate independently of the campaigns but have the ability to raise unlimited sums of money to promote their preferred candidates.

Clinton has also condemned the influence of big money on politics, but she is accepting the backing of two super PACs working to help elect her.

The main group, Priorities USA Action, raised $15.6 million in the first half of the year and has promises for another $25 million.

As Obama demonstrated in his races, a strong base of small donors can be a powerful force.

In his 2012 re-election campaign, 28 percent of his individual contributions — $216 million — came from donors who gave $200 or less, according to the nonpartisan Campaign Finance Institute.

Devine said the Sanders campaign had made a strategic decision not to try to match Clinton's early spending on television ads so it would have the money when it needs it.

"We wanted to have as big a pile of cash on hand at the end of this quarter while aggressively building operations in the early states," he said.
