Belen Sisa came to the United States from Argentina 15 years ago and now lives in Gilbert, Arizona.

She says it is time to change the language used by many to describe immigrants, people who come here to live from other countries.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/alien-immigrationlanguage-5863a18b.png" /> Sisa says that the terms "alien" and "illegal alien" are insulting and should not be used to describe immigrants.

She may soon get her wish.

A new bill — a proposed law — suggests that these terms should not be used by government.

Instead, the phrases would be replaced with "foreign national" and "undocumented foreign national."

An alien is a person who lives in a country but does not have citizenship there.

Many are workers, students or visitors from other countries.

The word "alien," however, is also used to describe a creature from another planet.

Sisa, now 21, said that describing human beings that way is insulting.

She said the terms make her feel as if "I'm not a human in the eyes of other people and the eyes of the federal government."

Joaquin Castro, a Democratic congressman from Texas, introduced the new bill, which is called the Correcting Hurtful and Alienating Names in Government Expression (CHANGE) Act, on Oct. 21.

It has already attracted 87 Democratic co-sponsors in the House of Representatives and the support of numerous immigrant groups.

If the bill passes the Senate and the House, it would go to President Barack Obama.

If he signed it, it would become a law.

Roger Rocha Jr. is president of the League of United Latin American Citizens, one of the largest Hispanic organizations in the United States.

He said that terms like "alien" are used by people who want to belittle immigrants.

He said the bill represents an important part of changing attitudes and noted that 70 percent of Americans support improving U.S. immigration law.

This is not the first time lawmakers have wanted to remove insulting language from the law.

Castro's office pointed to Rosa's Law, a 2010 measure that replaced references to "mental retardation" in federal law with "intellectual disability."

Two years later Congress passed the 21st Century Language Act.

That law removed the word "lunatic," an old term for mentally ill, from use in federal law.

Both bills passed with almost the complete support of Congress.

Representative Ruben Gallego, a Democrat from Arizona and a co-sponsor of the CHANGE Act, said he hopes to see the same support for this bill.

He said the word "alien" harms people who are going through the legal system and applying for jobs.

The bill, he said, is an effort to "use a more modern word."

Raul Grijalva, a Democratic congressman from Arizona, also co-sponsored the bill.

He said the issues of immigrants and civil rights are connected, which he said that some people do not understand.

"You could be a fifth-generation Latino," he said, and yet the language used about immigrants by political leaders feels racist.

"It makes you less than a full American," he said.

Sisa said the word has affected her personally.

When applying for a job, she said, an interviewer told her she is "technically … an alien" and asked if she was even allowed to apply for the job.

She said she understands why undocumented people must be characterized differently from citizens, but her hope is that the bill encourages the government to use language that is more respectful and sympathetic.

"Symbolically, it would mean that we're taking a step forward and we're accepting immigrants," Sisa said of the proposed change.

And that is the message Castro promotes with the bill.

"Words matter," he said, especially when they are about an issue as personal as immigration.
