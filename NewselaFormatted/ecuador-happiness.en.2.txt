Freddy Ehlers has been an important and well-known person here in Ecuador for many years.

He has been a television star, the minister of tourism and a two-time presidential candidate.

Now the 69-year-old is taking on what might be his most difficult job yet: He is trying to make the country happier.

Since 2013, Ehlers has been the State Secretary of Buen Vivir, with a government ministry under his command.

The Spanish term "buen vivir" roughly translates to "good living" or "well-being."

Ehlers prefers the second translation.

He has a staff of 30, a budget of $2 million a year to spend and a direct phone line to President Rafael Correa, Some people chuckle at the idea of a government official in charge of happiness.

Ehlers sees the work as extremely serious.

"The difference between living better and well-being is a matter of life or death," he said.

"Because if you use the word 'better' it means you're never satisfied with what you have.

It's unlimited growth."

Ecuadoreans are too focused on finding happiness through buying expensive things, he said.

Such consumerism threatens to ruin mental health, he insists.

Society overall has the same problem.

Countries are always seeking to develop, to raise living standards.

Such constant growth is threatening to destroy the planet.

We are polluting the air, cutting down forests and poisoning our water supply.

"We have to redefine what progress means, redefine development and redefine well-being," he said.

"What we're proposing is changing civilization because the one we have is going to lead us to 'eco-cide'" â€” to environmental suicide or self-destruction.

In 2008, Ecuador added the traditional Native American idea of Sumak Kawsay, or Good Life, to its constitution.

Five years later it created the office of State Secretary of Buen Vivir.

It became one of just a few nations that have made happiness-seeking an official, high-level governmental goal.

Some here picture Ehlers and his staff as spiritual types doing yoga in incense-filled rooms.

However, Ehlers insists he is out to get real-world results.

Earlier this year, his office began trying to figure out how to track and measure happiness.

One of his first projects was working with health officials to create a stop-light system on all packaged food.

Now, shoppers can quickly see if the sugar, salt and fat content in their snacks have green, yellow or red lights.

Making it easier to eat healthy promotes general well-being, the theory goes.

Even so, the system faced backlash from food companies, Ehlers said.

Some companies "have been seriously affected by this, but now they're trying to come out with products that are all green lights," he said.

"It's a small example of what we're trying to do."

The ministry has also produced a set of half-hour television programs that promote the happy lifestyle.

One might think everyone would be in favor of the government trying to increase the country's level of happiness.

In fact, Ehlers' department has come under attack.

Last week, anti-government protesters demanded the office be closed.

The government of President Correa has grown too large and wasteful, opposition Deputy Andras Paez said.

He called Ehlers' department "an insult to the intelligence of Ecuadoreans."

Much of Ecuador's governmental funding comes from the sale of oil.

Now that oil prices are falling, the government has been cutting costs and seeking money.

As a result, the need for a happiness program has been questioned by many.

"There are a lot of people who question the very existence of the ministry," political expert Oswaldo Moreno said.

"All this talk of well-being is a joke to some people but for others it's very serious."

Ehlers argues that his department is one of the smallest among government departments, even though making the country happier is a huge challenge.

"We have thousands of friends on Facebook and Twitter but we don't have anyone to hug; we don't have anyone to touch," Ehlers said.

The modern world can be a hard and lonely place, he added.

"We have to make time to hug people."
