It is getting hard to find enough people to referee youth sports.

One reason is that some referees have been attacked at games.

Some referees have been seriously hurt.

Referees make sure the games are played by the rules.

They are also called officials.

Jimmy Woods has been a referee for almost 30 years.

He works at youth sports games.

He has been yelled at.

People have threatened him.

He has been insulted.

These attacks have happened many times.

People do not respect officials anymore, said Woods.

He is a firefighter.

He is also a referee at games.

He said people think officials want to cheat them.

Referees in Utah and Michigan have died after being punched by angry players during games.

In September, two Texas football players ran into a referee on purpose.

People from all over were angry about that.

The fighting has made it harder to find referees.

Kansas is one state trying to find more referees.

The number of referees in Kansas has dropped since the 2012-13 school year.

Not having enough officials can cause many problems, said Gary Musselman.

He runs the Kansas State High School Activities Association. Games are delayed or moved.

Some games are not played at all.

Two years ago, the group started making it easier for people to become referees.

It also asked coaches to find players who might make good referees.

Barry Mano was a college basketball referee for 23 years.

He started a group for referees in 1980.

The group asked people who run high school sports leagues questions about referees in 2002.

Most of the people who run the sports leagues said there were not enough referees.  Mano also said fans have become more angry at referees.

Referees do not get paid very much, Mano said.

Referees are worried about their safety.

The money is not worth them getting hurt, Mano said.
