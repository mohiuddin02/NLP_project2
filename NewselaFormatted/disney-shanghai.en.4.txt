Disney wants to build a new theme park in Shanghai, China.

It wants the park to look Chinese.

It also wants it to look like all the other Disney parks.

It is not the first Disney park in China.

The first Disney park was in Hong Kong.

Hong Kong is on the sea in China.

Hong Kong has different rules than the rest of China.

The laws are less strict there.

Disneyland Hong Kong had trouble when it opened.

It had long lines during the holidays.

It was also more like Disneyland in California.

Disney learned from that experience.

It wants to make the new park more Chinese.

The new park will be in Shanghai.

The government has stricter rules there.

Disney worked hard to add more Chinese culture.

It had to be done the right way.

People who work for Disney traveled around China.

They went to schools and homes.

They talked about their ideas with a Chinese company.

The new park will not be like other Disney parks.

The buildings and rides will not be as American.

Visitors will enter on Mickey Avenue.

The road will show classic Disney characters.

Disney movies are popular in China.

But some people don't know all the characters.

Having two parks in China is not a problem, Disney says.

It has two parks in the United States.

It has Disneyland in California.

It also has Disney World in Florida.

Some people go to both parks.

Disney wants the two Chinese parks to help each other.
