Silently, they measure the angles of violin pegs and viola necks bent out of tune by years of use.

Here in the heart of old Havana, Andres Martinez and his two apprentices wage a daily battle against one of Cuba's lesser-known economic problems: A country famous for its music is running low on musical instruments.

Cuba's dozens of free music schools turn out thousands of skilled young musicians each year, many of whom play imported instruments that can only be repaired and maintained with hard-to-find materials from abroad.

Delicate and complex, string instruments are among the hardest to keep in tune.

Before Cuba's 1959 revolution, many students played violins, violas, cellos and bass violins from European workshops.

After it, Cuba was cut off from trading with many Western European countries and the former Soviet Union became Cuba's main provider of violins and cellos.

Now, as Cuba struggles to revive its weak economy, students must make do with violins from China that too easily pop strings and lose their tone.

Sponsored in part by a Belgian group called Fiddlemakers Without Frontiers, Martinez and his apprentices repair dozens of instruments a year.

They make a handful from scratch and train aspiring young violin makers in an attempt to create a native Cuban violin industry.

"We do everything here from minor repairs to major renovations," said Martinez, 41.

"It's a profession that requires a lot of dedication."

Martinez's workshop opened three years ago.

Since then, he has overseen the repair of more than 400 violins, violas, cellos and bass violins, the restringing of some 200 bows and the manufacture of a dozen high-quality violins for professional musicians.

Using high-end imported tools and varnishes, Martinez takes pride in the quality of his work.

Such quality, he says, cannot be found among amateur repairmen who use hammers to fix violins.

"Fiddle making isn't carpentry," he said.

The workshop lends instruments to musicians who need them for concerts or competitions.

It has come to fill a gap left by the death or emigration of Cuba's handful of world-class violin repairmen in recent decades, musicologist Miriam Escudero said.

"This workshop fills a great need," she said.

Cuba did open a violin factory in the eastern province of Camaguey in the 1970s.

However, the native cedar has nowhere near the quality of European rosewood and maple when it comes to making instruments.

Martinez and his apprentices say their next challenge will be converting the workshop into a financially self-sustaining operation, so it won't need money from outside groups to stay in business.

The future of Cuban music may depend, in a small way, on their success or failure.

"It's like with people," said workman Juan Carlos Prado, 25.

"If you feel bad, you need a doctor.

The same thing happens with a musical instrument — if it isn't working well, you can hear it in the music."
