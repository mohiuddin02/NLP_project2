 Michael J. Zogry teaches at the University of Kansas.

Not long ago he found an audio recording.

The voice on the recording belonged to James Naismith.

He invented the sport of basketball 124 years ago.

Naismith died 76 years ago.

On the recording, Naismith says the first game he organized was a mess.

It is the largest library in the world. The recording was part of a radio show called "We the People."

It was recorded in 1939.

Naismith described how he set up the game with two peach baskets at a YMCA school in Massachusetts in December 1891.

Naismith was a teacher.

He was given two weeks to make up a new indoor activity for his gym class.

Thanks to a blizzard his students were stuck inside.

Their restlessness made Naismith work faster.

"We tried everything to keep them quiet," Naismith said on the recording.

The students played football in the gym.

Soon they became bored.

Naismith wanted to keep them busy.

He decided to try his new idea using an old soccer ball and two teams of nine players each.

He described the object of the game to his students.

They would try and throw the ball into the opposing team's peach basket.

"I blew a whistle and the first game of basketball began," Naismith said.

It did not go smoothly.

Naismith said the players almost immediately started tackling each other.

Even worse, two young men got black eyes while another was knocked out.

Naismith had to pull players apart, he said.

"I didn't have enough (rules), and that's where I made my big mistake," Naismith said.

Naismith invented the 13 rules of the game shortly after that first crazy game.  "There was the first game, then there was a second game," Zogry said.

In between games, the players nagged Naismith to fix the rules.

He quickly fixed the rules, Zogry added.

Naismith's grandson, Jim, had never heard his grandfather's voice until Zogry found the recording.

It changes almost everything that has been written about that first game, he said.

"When he turned those 18 guys loose, obviously they were having a good time, but obviously this was kind of try number 1.

He ... said he didn't write enough rules.

It came out of that experience," Jim Naismith said.

"That makes a lot of sense."

Rob Rains wrote a book called "James Naismith: The Man Who Invented Basketball."

It was written with Naismith's granddaughter Hellen Carpenter.

Rains did not know of any other audio recording of Naismith.

The recording suggests Naismith made changes to the game "much more quickly than we first thought," he said.

Zogry was surprised to discover the audio.

He realized it was the only recording of Naismith's voice that exists today.

Audio recordings from that long ago are rare.

To find a lost recording and share it with the public is "very exciting," he said.  Naismith worked at the University of Kansas for 40 years.

He was the school's first basketball coach.

The 13 original rules were given to the school and will displayed on campus.
