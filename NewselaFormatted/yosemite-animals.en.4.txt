In 1997, black bears broke into more than 600 cars at Yosemite National Park.

They wandered into tents.

They knocked over garbage cans.

The bears were searching for food.

Today, the bears are behaving better.

Now, hardly any bears damage property or hurt people.

In 1998, there were 1,584 reports of damage.

There were just 120 last year.

The reason?

Park workers are training bears to stay away from people.

More importantly, they are training people to keep food away from bears.

"The numbers are down, and that's awesome," said Ryan Leahy.

He is a Yosemite bear expert.

Yosemite has 300 to 500 black bears.

"Have you ever been in a vehicle or house that a bear has been in?

It's not pretty," said Mike Tollefson.

He used to be in charge of Yosemite.

"They just don't poop in the woods.

The big ones weigh 400 pounds.

They can run as fast as a horse, and they're strong."

A new program solved the problem.

First, the park hired more bear experts.

Next, the park educated visitors.

Campers learned that it is against the law to feed bears.

The park showed bear safety videos to visitors.

Campers were told to store food in special containers.

They should not leave food in cars.

"People were hanging food on ropes in trees," Tollefson said.

"Mother bears taught their cubs how to climb up and get it."

Finally, park workers tracked bears that were causing problems.

Park workers will chase bears from campsites.

They will even shoot small bean bags or balls to scare them away.

They want bears to fear people.

Now, bears in Yosemite are becoming wild again.

They are eating less human food.

"Bears that get too (used) to people lose their fear of people," Steve Johnson said.

He has been camping at Yosemite since 1971.

He started going there when he was 12.

The more bears and people stay apart, "the better for everybody," he said.
