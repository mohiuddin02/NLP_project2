It has not rained much in California.

It has been that way for three years.

Rivers and streams are dry.

One animal could help the water flow again.

Beavers are coming to help.

Beavers make dams.

Their dams are good for nature.

First, beavers drag a tree across a stream.

They carry rocks and mud with their paws.

They use their big front teeth to carry branches.

The dams block off water.

This makes a deep pool.

It keeps the water from flowing away.

California has lost a lot of wetlands.

Those are lands that are watery.

They are usually next to rivers or streams.

A swamp is a wetland.

Rick Lanman studies nature.

Beavers can bring back the wetlands, he said.

Beaver dams do many good things.

They make soil better.

The soil in their dams holds more water.

Then more plants grow.

Fish and animals eat the plants.

Dams help streams flow in summer.

The streams could dry up from the heat.

There are many dry areas in California.

The state might send beavers to the dry places.

This is not as easy as it sounds.

You cannot always move beavers to a new spot.

Beavers can cause a lot of damage.

They ruin pipes.

They harm farmland.

Beaver dams also can flood homes.

The government has an idea.

It made its own dams.

They are like a beaver's dam.

It is trying them out in streams.

If the dams work, beavers can stay where they are.
