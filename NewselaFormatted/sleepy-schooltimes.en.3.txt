Do you have trouble waking up in the morning?

If you do, it may be because you are not getting enough sleep.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), a group of doctors that studies young people, says that sleepiness is a serious health problem for teenagers.

It is very common for teenagers to not get enough sleep.

Most high school students in the U.S. get less sleep than doctors say they should.

Teenagers should sleep for between 8.5 and 9.5 hours each night.

Currently, however, the average student in 12th grade gets less than 7 hours of sleep at night.

Not getting enough sleep causes students to be exhausted.

This exhaustion leads to a number of problems.

Being tired makes it harder to be happy, pay attention, remember, and make good decisions.

If teens suffer when they do not get enough sleep, why don't they just go to bed earlier?

The answer is: they can't.

Studies show that even when teenagers want to go to sleep early, their bodies do not always let them.

This means that it is not possible for them just to change their bedtimes.

If teens cannot fall asleep earlier, the best way to fix the sleepiness problem may be to allow them sleep later.

School should start later in the morning, the AAP says.

Studies have shown that a later start time would help students get an extra hour of sleep each night.

Also, if school starts later in the morning, the number of absent students may go down.

Students may even do better in class because they are not so tired.

Later start times could cause scheduling problems.

Will there still be enough time for classes if the school day starts later?

Will parents still be able to get their kids ready for school before going to work?

Even though it might be hard, the AAP says that schools should try to make later start times work.

Starting school later could have important health benefits.

You may even find it easier to wake up in the morning.
