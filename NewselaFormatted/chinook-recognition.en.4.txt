The Chinook tribes greeted Lewis and Clark when the explorers arrived in 1805.

The explorers were the first Americans of European ancestry to travel through the western United States.

The [Native Americans](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Native+American) brought the explorers food.

They helped the explorers find their way.

More than 200 years have passed.

Now, the Chinook Indian Nation has a constitution.

It has a tribal council.

It is not, however, considered a tribe by the U.S. government.

The government claims the tribes died out, said Kate Elliot.

She is a member of the Chinook Tribal Council.

"But my family still lives on our (ancestral) land."

The Chinook may be able to call themselves a tribe under new rules.

The U.S. government is trying to change how it officially identifies a tribe.

Recognition is important for tribes.

They may get money to educate their children.

They also get services like health care.

Recognized tribes are considered independent nations.

They can make their own laws.

They can govern their territory.

Recognized tribes decide who is a member.

Right now, tribes have to prove they have existed through history.

This is not easy for some tribes.

Many of them have gaps in their tribal records.

Records are missing from the late 1800s to the 1930s, Elliot said.

During that time, the U.S. government took Indian children from their families.

They put the children in special schools.

The government wanted them to forget they were Indian.

Now, the government has suggested new rules.

The rules would make it easier for tribes to be recognized.

A tribe would need to prove it existed only since 1934.

This would be helpful to the Chinook, Elliot said.

The nation has many records from the 1930s.

The new rules would also let rejected tribes apply again.

This was not allowed before.

"If there is one thing we are, we are stubborn, which is the reason we are still here," Elliott said.

"We are not giving up."
