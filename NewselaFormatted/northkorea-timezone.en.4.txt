North Korea does not have many friends.

It does not get along with its neighbors in Asia.

Its nearest neighbors are South Korea and Japan.

North Korea is very different from both countries.

Now it will be even more different.

It will have its own time zone.

Time zones fix a problem with time.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/AP_462948318428.png" /> For example, it is daytime in one part of the world.

In another part, it is nighttime.

It would be strange to say it was the same time in both places.

Time zones fix this problem.

Inside one time zone it is the same time everywhere.

Other time zones are ahead or behind.

If it is 1 p.m. in New York City, it would be 7 p.m. in Paris, France.

Some countries are very big.

They have many time zones.

Small countries have only one time zone.

Many small countries are next to each other.

They use the same time zone.

North Korea's time zone was the same as South Korea's and Japan's time zone.

Now it will be 30 minutes behind.

North and South Korea were once the same country.

It was just called Korea.

In 1910, Japan took over Korea.

It ruled for 35 years.

Japan made many changes in Korea.

It forced Koreans to use the Japanese time zone.

The Japanese were kicked out in 1945.

In 1948 North and South Korea split.

They became two countries.

Now North Korea has taken a big step.

It has undone what the Japanese did.

It has returned to the old Korean time zone.

Many Koreans are still angry at the Japanese.

They are happy to see the old Korean time zone return.

Not only do North Koreans feel that way.

Many South Koreans do, too.

The new time zone is called "Pyongyang Time."

Pyongyang is the country's capital city.
