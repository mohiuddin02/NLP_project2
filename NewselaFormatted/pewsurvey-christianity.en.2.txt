The United States has become significantly less Christian in the last eight years, a major new study found.

Meanwhile, the share of American adults who say they follow no religious belief increased sharply, according to the study.

For what is likely the first time in U.S. history, the actual number of American Christians has declined.

Christianity, however, remains by far the nation's main religious tradition, according to the report.

The study was conducted by the Pew Research Center.

The erosion in traditional religious ranks seems likely to continue.

Among Americans aged 18 to 33, just slightly more than half identify themselves as Christian.

That compares with roughly 8 in 10 in the baby boom generation and older age groups, the report said.

The baby boom generally refers to people born between the end of World War II in 1945 and 1964.

Also, younger Americans do not appear to follow traditional faiths more as they become parents.

Just the opposite seems to be happening.

Members of the millennial generation have grown less religious as they age.

Millennials generally are considered people born between the early 1980s and early 2000s.

Whether a person attends religious services regularly is among the best signs for predicting how he or she will vote.

Traditional religion is strongly tied to the Republican Party, at least among white Americans.

It may work both ways.

Some scholars believe that close links between traditional religion and conservatism, particularly on issues such as same-sex marriage, have led many younger Americans to cut their ties with organized religion.

Opposition to same-sex marriage on the part of religious conservatives "is turning off so many people from Christianity," said Phil Zuckerman.

He is a sociology professor at Pitzer College.

"We're seeing a backlash" against the linking of religion and politics, he said.

Almost 1 in 5 American adults were raised in a religious tradition but are now unaffiliated, the study found.

Only 4 percent have moved in the other direction.

A leading conservative religious figure, however, said he thought the trend could be a positive development.

People who once would have been "pretend Christian" are now being more honest about their beliefs, said Russell Moore.

He is president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention.

Churches should not try to water down their beliefs or change their position on issues such as marriage in order to appeal to a broader audience, he said.

Because the U.S. Census Bureau does not ask questions about religion, the massive religion surveys by the Pew Research Center have become a chief source of information on the U.S. religious landscape.

The current survey questioned 35,071 U.S. adults last summer.

The study found that the U.S. is still far more religious than most other economically advanced countries.

But the significant increase in the share of Americans who do not follow a traditional religious belief mirrors trends in Europe and elsewhere.

"It's becoming much more possible, much more viable, to identify as secular," or nonreligious, in the U.S. today, Zuckerman said.

In previous generations, a lack of religious affiliation was viewed as a mark of being un-American.

Now, "people are starting to see being nonreligious as an OK option," he said.

Nationwide, just short of 1 in 4 Americans describe themselves as not following a particular religion.

That is up from roughly 1 in 6 in 2007, according to the new study.

The study calls those people "nones."

The ranks of the "nones" have grown in large part from people abandoning the religion in which they were raised.

That trend toward being nonreligious is particularly strong in the West, the report said.

By comparison, the South remains the most heavily Christian part of the nation.

The decline in organized religious belief has been sharpest among Americans born since the mid-1960s.

And in those groups, organized religion does not appear to be gaining followers as people age.

"If you work in the church, you see it happening," said Bishop R. Guy Erwin of the Southwest California Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church.

Many churches cannot keep members, he said.

Married people are more likely to have a religious affiliation than the unmarried.

However, both groups have grown less attached to organized religion in recent years, the report said.

Christian ranks have eroded.

Roughly 173 million adult Americans identify themselves as Christian, just under 71 percent of the U.S. population.

That is down from 178 million, or 78 percent of the U.S. population, in 2007.

The total U.S. adult population rose by about 8 percent during those eight years.

Among non-Christian faiths, Judaism remains the largest in the U.S.

But only about 2 percent of the U.S. population identifies as Jewish.

Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism each have less than 1 percent of the U.S. population.

However, the Muslim and Hindu populations have both grown rapidly, reflecting the higher numbers of people who have moved to the U.S. from Asia.
