Last fall, Wylie Brys was digging in the dirt with his dad.

He found a 3-inch bone.

The bone was from a dinosaur.

Wylie was just 4 years old.

The dinosaur is called Nodosaurus.

It lived 94 million years ago.

It looked like a fat cow with armor, said Michael Polcyn.

He is a scientist from Southern Methodist University (SMU) in Texas.

He studies dinosaurs.

Wylie found the bone last fall.

On April 3, scientists started digging.

The scientists did not expect to find much.

Suddenly, they found one bone.

It was connected to another bone, and then another.

Soon, they found more than half of the Nodosaurus.

Only five nodosaurs have ever been found in the area.

Wylie's dinosaur is the most complete one, said Louis Jacobs.

He is another dinosaur expert.

He wrote a book about dinosaurs.

The scientists wrapped up the bones.

They moved them to a lab at SMU.

There, they will take the skeleton apart.

Then they will clean the bones.

Finally they will put the dinosaur back together.

Nodosaurs were short and fat.

Their bodies were covered in hard plates.

Nodosaurs ate plants.

They were about the size of a small horse.

The scientists found fish scales and bones around the Nodosaurus.

Millions of years ago, the area was underwater.

Wylie is not that excited about finding the dinosaur.

He just likes digging in the dirt.

Wylie calls the dinosaur Ralphie.

He named it after Raphael.

Raphael is his favorite Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle.

Wylie and his dad will keep digging.

His dad could not promise to find another dinosaur.

"But we'll keep looking," Tim Byrs said.
