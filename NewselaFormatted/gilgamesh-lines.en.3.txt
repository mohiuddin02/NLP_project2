The Islamic State group has destroyed some of them.

Chunks of history have been wiped out.

The Islamic State is a violent group.

It wants to start its own country under Islamic law.

Its fighters have taken over parts of Syria.

Some of northern and western Iraq is also under its control.

The Islamic State has bulldozed and exploded temples and palaces in Iraq and Syria.

The group has also sold ancient treasures from these places.

This is illegal, meaning it is against the law.

There is at least one heartwarming story coming from the area.

A museum in Iraq has rescued a group of artifacts from smugglers.

In doing that, it also discovered something new.

Ancient History Et Cetera is a news website about archaeology and history.

It recently reported that in 2011, the Sulaymaniyah Museum bought a bunch of ancient tablets.

The tablets are 2,600 years old.

The museum had offered a "no questions asked" deal to smugglers.

In other words, the museum would not ask where they got the treasures or call the police.

They were hoping to keep the antiquities from leaving the country.

All of the tablets were partly still covered with mud, Ancient History said.

Some were whole, while others were broken.

It is not known where they were dug up, but it is likely they were dug up illegally from the southern part of old Babel in Iraq.

In ancient times, Babel was known as Babylon, and the entire area was called Mesopotamia.

Many experts call Mesopotamia the cradle of civilization.

Scientists carefully cleaned and examined the tablets.

They realized there was one especially exciting find.

A broken tablet was carved in cuneiform script, the writing system of the time.

On it were previously unknown lines from the story, the Epic of Gilgamesh.

Some consider the 4,000-year-old legend to be the world's oldest story.

The legend tells of Gilgamesh, the great king of Uruk.

He travels with his friend Enkidu, a wild man who is partly a god, into the Cedar Forest.

They want to defeat the ogre Humbaba, who guards the forest.

The Epic of Gilgamesh contains many themes that are shared by other cultures.

Among them are a hero who is too proud, and the fear of death.

There is even a great flood, survived by a man on a giant boat called an ark.

The tablets were translated mainly by two experts in ancient Babylon from the School of Oriental and African Studies in London.

Farouk Al-Rawi is with the Department of Languages and Cultures of the Near and Middle East.

The second, Andrew George, had recently translated the story into English.

The 20 new lines offer some new details.

Ancient History described a few.

In the new discovery, Gilgamesh and Enkidu saw monkeys in Cedar Forest.

Monkeys were not in other, earlier versions of the story.

Humbaba is not an ogre in the new lines.

Instead, he is a foreign ruler being entertained with music at the king's court.

He was entertained by the chatter of monkeys, a chorus of cicada and squawking of birds, who together made a song.

In one way, the story sounds modern.

Gilgamesh and Enkidu cut down cedar trees from the Cedar Forest to take home.

The new tablets say that they cut down too many trees, which "is a bad thing to have done, and will upset the gods," George said.

Being so aware of the environment is very rare in ancient poetry, George added.

The Epic of Gilgamesh was important in ancient Mesopotamia.

It was passed down over the centuries.

Eventually the ancient Mesopotamian kingdoms were wiped out and the story was forgotten.

It was mainly by accident that it was rediscovered by European scholars in the 1800s.
