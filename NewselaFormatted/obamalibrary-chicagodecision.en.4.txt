His presidential library and museum will be built in Chicago.

In a video Tuesday, the president and his wife said the library will on the city's South Side.

They have not decided which park the library will be built in.

Presidents traditionally build a presidential library after leaving the White House.

It is more than a normal library.

It is also a museum.

A presidential library holds papers and souvenirs from a president's time in office.

It is often located in the president's hometown.

Obama was born in Hawaii.

It was in Chicago, though, where all the parts of his life came together, Obama said.

"I really became a man when I moved to Chicago."

The video showed him seated with his wife, Michelle Obama.

Chicago's South Side is where he went to work for a community group after college.

"That's where I met my wife," Obama said.

"That's where my children were born."

Michelle Obama grew up in Chicago.

She said she was thrilled to put the library "in the heart of the neighborhood that means the world to me."

She added, "Every value, every memory, every important relationship to me exists in Chicago.

I consider myself a South Sider."

A group called the Barack Obama Foundation is building the library.

The group said it would get ideas from many different people and groups as it plans.

For more than a year, the University of Chicago competed with three universities.

Columbia University in New York wanted the library.

The University of Hawaii and the University of Illinois at Chicago fought for it as well.

Obama had connections with all the schools.

The foundation said it still plans to work with the three universities, too.

The foundation originally planned to announce the library in March.

Those plans were put off because of an election for mayor in Chicago.

In the beginning, there were 13 possible sites for the library.

The University of Chicago was considered the favorite.

Obama taught law there for about 12 years.

The first lady also worked at the university's hospital.

The city's South Side was where Obama began his career as a state senator in 1996.

The first lady was born in Chicago and grew up there.

Still, the university was not a sure thing.

It wanted to build the library on land that is a park.

Some people in Chicago did not think a public park should be used for the private library.
