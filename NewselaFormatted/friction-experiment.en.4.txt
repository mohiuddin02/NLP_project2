Friction is what slows things down when they slide against each other.

It is a big part of our lives.

Sometimes it helps us.

Friction is what stops a car when someone steps on the brake pedal.

Other times it is not a help.

It drags against car tires, making them wear out.

Everyone sees these things, but even scientists do not know everything about why they happen.

A new study might help scientists to understand more.

It looks at how atoms work in friction.

Atoms are called the building blocks of everything in the world.

They are the smallest part of something.

They are so tiny that they cannot be seen without special microscopes.

Atoms are arranged differently in different things.

Scientists said that the way they are arranged changes the friction between things.

We know that direction changes friction.

Petting a cat is easier in one direction than the other.

What is new is that the scientists were able to understand how this works with atoms.

When two things are pushed closer together it makes more friction.

Even things that look smooth, like glass, have tiny bumps too small to see.

When something slides against something else, the bumps on it drag on the bumps of the other thing.

This causes heat.

The heat means that force is lost.

Then things slow down.

Think of walking on a sidewalk.

The rubber soles of your shoes catch on the street, slowing you down.

This is one way that friction is important.

Without friction, you would slip and slide.

Scientists knew about these rules.

Still, there are many things they do not know.

Scientists hoped the study would teach them more.

The scientists slid a tiny metal point against something.

When they did that, the atoms separated into pairs.

These pairs rocked back and forth.

That made heat.

The scientists found that the heat of the rocking could be controlled.

There was less heat when they went in the direction of the atom pairs.

There was more when they went against it.

Scientists hope understanding this will help people use friction in ways that are helpful.

What they learned could help with many things.

It might even help make those car tires last longer.
