San Francisco 49ers linebacker Chris Borland is leaving football.

He said he wants to avoid the damage that blows to the head can cause.

Not even the chance to be a star player and to earn piles of money can change his mind.

Borland is retiring at the young age of 24.

The 49ers announced his decision Monday night.

Borland said he wants to do "what's best for my health."

Football players are often hit on the head during games.

Bad blows to the head are known as concussions.

Over time, all of those hits can cause damage to their brains.

Players can suffer memory loss and their thinking can become confused.

"From what I've researched and what I've experienced, I don't think it's worth the risk," Borland said.

He said that right now his memory and thinking seem pretty much the same as always.

However, he does not want to wait until it is "too late."

San Francisco 49ers general manager Trent Baalke said the team was surprised that Borland wanted to leave football.

Still, it supports Borland's decision, he said.

The National Football League (NFL) said that it also supports Borland's decision.

However, it added that "football has never been safer."

New rules and better equipment are making things much safer for players, the league said.

NFL vice president Jeff Miller said things have gotten much better for players.

He said that there were fewer concussions last year than in earlier years.

"There is more work to do," Miller admitted.

However, the league will keep on trying its best to make the sport safe to play, he said.

Baalke said he had talked to Borland about his decision to leave football.

He could tell that Borland "put a great deal of thought into this," he said.

Borland was "a very well-respected member of our team," Baalke said.

"We will always consider him a 49er and wish him all the best," Baalke added.
