Rides on the train could be some of the cheapest high-speed rail rides in the world, the Los Angeles Times found.

California residents voted to have the state set aside billions of dollars for the project seven years ago.

Back then, they were told that a ride from Los Angeles to San Francisco would cost about $50.

Now the state said an average ticket would cost $86.

Although the price increased by $36, the train would still be one of the least expensive high-speed trips in the world.

No one can really say now how much a ride on the bullet train will actually cost.

The train is not expected to be running full-time until 2028.

At that point, the prices will be set with the help of a private company, said Jeff Morales.

He is in charge of the California High-Speed Rail Authority.

The group is planning the train project and it will run the bullet train when it's done.

Millions of travelers will look at the fares to decide if they will ride the high-speed train.

They could also choose to fly or drive instead.

Ticket prices are important for figuring out how much money the trains make.

State law says the high-speed train system cannot get extra money from the state.

It must pay for itself.

Morales and other state officials say the system will quickly make money.

But experts warn that you cannot count on the predictions.

No one knows how many people will ride the train.

They say the state could have to keep paying for the system.

Whenever you try to predict things more than five years away, you are just guessing, said Lisa Schweitzer.

She is a transportation expert at the University of Southern California.

Things can change a lot in five years, she said.

Between 18 million and 31 million passengers are expected to ride the train each year to start.

By 2030, ticket sales are expected to hit $2 billion a year.

That figure would be about $700 million a year more than it would cost to operate the bullet train.

A ticket for $86 would be a bargain, the Times said.

The fare would be about 20 cents a mile.

The average fare on Italy's bullet train was 25 cents a mile.

The fare in China was 22 cents a mile.

The French bullet train from Paris to Lyon is often said to make money.

However, it has a fare of 52 cents a mile.

The German bullet train from Hanover to Wurzburg charges 46 cents a mile.

Amtrak's Acela system on the East Coast is the closest thing to high-speed rail in the United States.

It charges an average of about 50 cents a mile.

The train system is expected to make extra money from advertising.

Payments from business at train stations would also bring in money.

Still, some outside experts wonder if ticket sales will pay for all the costs of running the train.

"The train will lose money," said Joseph Vranich.

It will need money from the state, he said.

Vranich used to be president of a U.S. group that wants the country to have high-speed trains.

William Grindley is a business expert.

He does not like the high-speed train project.

Grindley said the system will lose money unless ticket prices go up a lot and a lot of people ride the trains.

He said the bullet train definitely will not make money.

Grindley wrote a report about the bullet train in 2012.

The report said the state would have to pay millions of dollars to support the bullet train "forever."

Morales, the rail authority's chief executive, said Grindley's group is wrong.

He said his agency's ridership forecasts have been checked by outside experts.
