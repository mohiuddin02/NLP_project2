There were ideas about how the universe worked.

But scientists did not know how the small blocks, or particles, could form the world we know today.

Scientists Francois Englert of Belgium and Peter Higgs of Britain had an idea.

They came up with the Higgs particle.

It was also known as the Higgs boson.

Some people even call it the "God particle."

Last year, scientists at CERN laboratory in Geneva proved that the Higgs boson existed.

On Tuesday, Englert and Higgs were awarded the Nobel Prize in physics, the science of energy and matter.

"I hope this recognition of fundamental science will help raise awareness of the value of blue-sky research," the 84-year-old Higgs said.

Blue-sky research is theoretical.

It does not have any immediate real-world uses.

The 80-year-old Englert said he did not imagine getting a Nobel Prize when he started the research half a century ago.

"You don't work thinking to get the Nobel Prize, that's not how you work," Englert said.

"(Still) we had the impression that we were doing something that was important, that would later on be used by other researchers."

Englert and Higgs came up with the idea of the Higgs boson.

However, proving it actually existed took thousands of scientists at CERN.

Since the Nobel can only be split between three people at most, it would have been impossible to single out just one.

Nobel Academy member Ulf Danielsson pointed out that the prize document also honored the work done at CERN.

He called the discovery a big event in the history of physics.

"This is a giant discovery, it means the final building block in the so-called standard model for particle physics has been put in place," Danielsson said.

The standard model is the basic picture of how physics works on Earth.

Englert and Higgs came up with the idea of the Higgs boson to provide an answer to a riddle: Why matter has mass.

They believed the tiny particle acts like molasses on snow.

It made other basic building blocks of nature stick together, slow down and form atoms.

Without it, they would never come together.

The universe would just be a bunch of particles flying around.

Scientists wondered how matter formed shortly after the Big Bang.

They had an explanation that centers on the idea that there is an invisible field throughout the universe.

Particles travel through the field.

They are slowed down like a ball rolling through sticky molasses.

If this is the case, then it should be possible to detect a type of particle.

The particle was named the Higgs boson.

It took about 50 years before scientists at CERN were able to show its existence in July 2012.

To find it, they had to build a $10 billion collider in a 17-mile tunnel beneath the Swiss-French border.

Scientists used the collider to slam trillions of protons into each other.

The protons collided.

The crashes produced energies like those right after the Big Bang that supposedly marked the origin of the universe.

Scientists examined information from the collisions to find proof that the Higgs boson exists.

Michael Turner is president of a group of physicists.

He said the Higgs particle captured the imagination of the public.

"If you're a physicist, you can't get in a taxi anywhere in the world without having the driver ask you about the Higgs particle," said Turner.

He is also a scientist at the University of Chicago.

Turner said the finding of the Higgs boson completed the standard model.

But beyond that, he said, it represents the first in a class of particles that scientists think played a part in shaping the universe.

That means it points the way to tackling other mysteries.

The announcement was widely expected.

But it was delayed an hour, which is highly unusual.

The academy decides the winners in a majority vote on the day of the announcement.

The academy's Staffan Normark said the academy had tried to reach Higgs on Tuesday but "all the numbers we tried he did not answer."

He wouldn't say if that's why the announcement was delayed.

The physics prize was the second of this year's Nobel awards to be announced.

On Monday, the Nobel Prize in medicine was given to three American scientists for discoveries about how important substances are moved around within cells.

The prizes were established by a rich Swedish businessman named Alfred Nobel.

Each prize is worth $1.2 million.
