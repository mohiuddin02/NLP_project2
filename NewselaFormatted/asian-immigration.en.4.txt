Hispanics are the largest group of people moving to the United States.

They come from Mexico and other Latin American countries.

In 50 years, things will be different.

By then, Asians will be the largest group.

The Pew Research Center gives people information about the world.

Scientists at Pew did a study.

They predicted the number of Americans in the year 2065.

The scientists studied people who were born in other countries.

They said these immigrants will make up 1 in 5 people living in the United States.

Today, people from other countries make up less than that.

There are many reasons why things are changing.

More Asians are moving here.

Fewer Hispanics are moving here.

Also, women in Latin America are having fewer babies.

Scientists say women in Mexico are now having about two children.

Fifty years ago, a woman might have had seven children.

Fewer children means fewer Hispanics are coming to The United States.

At the same time, more people are coming from Asia.

They are coming here to go to college.

Some are coming to work at jobs.

Scientists say there will still be more Hispanics than Asians living here.

There is a reason for that.

Hispanics are having more babies inside the United States.

Scientists asked Americans to describe immigrants.

Most Americans said immigrants will make the country better.

About 1 out of every 3 said they make the country worse.
