Oreo is the best-selling cookie in the world.

Mondelez International company just came out with a new kind, called Oreo Thins.

They are only about half as thick as regular Oreos and just a little wider.

Oreo Thins might be skinny, but they were not made just for dieters.

These slim cookies are designed to be a little fancier and more grown-up than old-fashioned Oreos.

They are not meant to be twisted apart like the other Oreos.

Oreo Thins have a big job ahead of them.

They are supposed to make the world's favorite brand of cookie an even bigger success.

The Oreo is already the king of cookies in the United States.

Nearly $1 out of every $5 spent on cookies is used to buy Oreos.

Keebler is the second-biggest brand.

Last year, Americans spent about twice as much on Oreos as they did on all of Keebler's cookies added up.

Americans buy 1 1/2 times as many Oreos as they did just 10 years ago.

Total cookie sales have only grown by about one-tenth.

This shows that Americans are not buying that many more cookies than usual, but most of the cookies they buy are Oreos.

Of course, Americans are not the only ones who love Oreos.

The famous chocolate cookies are enjoyed all across the globe.

About 5 of every 100 cookies sold around the world are Oreos.

That is three times more than any other brand sells.

There are many reasons Oreos have become so popular.

For one thing, people really like them.

Many Oreos are eaten plain or dipped in milk.

Lots of them are used to make other foods better.

Oreos can be mixed with ice cream, blended into milkshakes, ground into pie crust or crumbled up and used as a topping.

Sometimes they are even deep-fried.

Oreos have been around for more than 100 years.

They were first made by Nabisco in 1912.

Since then, people have gotten used to the Oreo brand.

They love its sandwich shape.

For many, Oreos bring back memories of learning to twist and dunk them.

Oreos are very old-fashioned, but sometimes the company tries new cookie flavors.

Mixing things up helps the company to grow.

It gets people interested in trying Oreo for the first time.

Some old customers like trying new things, too.

Over the years, Oreo has come up with lots of new flavors.

Some of them have been big hits.

Golden Oreos have vanilla cookies instead of chocolate.

They sold so well that the company decided to keep making them.

Wild flavors like Watermelon Oreos usually sell for just a short time.

Mondelez International started selling Oreo Thins in China last year.

The new cookies were very popular.

Now they are being placed on store shelves in the United States.

The company would like to sell Oreo Thins all over the world.
