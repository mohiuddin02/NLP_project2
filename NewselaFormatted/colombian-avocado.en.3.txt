Avocados from ... Colombia?

Americans love to eat avocados, and they ship them in from far and wide.

The largest number of avocados come from Mexico, but there are several other regions that sell avocados to the United States as well.

The more they sell, the more money those regions make.

Now, Colombia is hoping to get into the American avocado business.

Colombia already grows a lot of avocados.

To start selling them in the United States, however, growers need to get over a few hurdles.

First, they need to show that their avocados are properly grown and safe to eat.

Next, they will have to get permission to sell avocados in the United States.

Getting permission is complicated and can take years.

Still, most people think Colombia will start selling avocados in the United States within the next two years or so.

Colombia already does a lot of business with the United States.

Aurelio Iragorri is Colombia's minister of agriculture.

He is one of the people in charge of growing and selling Colombian crops.

He said Colombia already sells 80 agricultural products to the United States.

Avocados could be number 81.

Selling avocados could make Colombian growers a lot of money.

Americans love avocados and are eating more and more each year.

Avocado sales in the United States have almost doubled in the past 14 years.

The number of people buying avocados has increased, but so has the number of people selling avocados.

Selling avocados has become like a contest.

Each region hopes that Americans will buy its avocados, rather than the avocados from other areas.

Mexico is the largest seller of avocados in the United States.

In 2014, it sold 1.3 billion pounds of avocados to the U.S. California was the next largest, selling 282 million pounds.

Peru sold 144 million pounds and Chile sold 89 million pounds.

Some Colombians think they too can sell millions of pounds of avocados.

Colombia is closer to the U.S. than Peru and Chile are.

As a result, it may be able to sell avocados in the United States more easily than Peru and Chile.

He thinks that the Colombian avocado business will be successful.

Avocados are very popular in the United States and are getting more popular all the time.

Colombian companies are still waiting for permission to sell avocados in the United States.

They have already begun increasing their business, though.

From 2008 to 2014, avocado farms in Colombia doubled in size.

The country is on track to produce 42,500 tons this year, Iragorri said.

"But 42,000 tons isn't enough," he said, looking forward to a U.S. opening.

"Avocados have a great future."

California and Mexico may not be happy if Colombian avocados become popular.

It could mean less business for them.

There is one avocado-growing region that does not have to worry about Colombia, however.

Florida is the second-largest avocado state in the nation, right behind California.

It is expected to harvest about 66 million pounds of avocados this year.

That is according to the state's Avocado Committee.

Unlike California and Colombia, however, Florida specializes in green avocados.

Green avocados are a different kind of avocado.

Most Americans are used to small dark-skinned avocados called Haas avocados.

Green avocados are larger.

Their skin stays green, even when ripe.

Brooks Tropicals is South Florida's largest grower of avocados.

It has started calling Florida's green avocados "SlimCados."

"Slim" is another word for skinny.

The nickname reminds people that green avocados are healthy.

They have less fat than Haas avocados.

So they might help with weight loss.

Mary Ostlund works at Brooks Tropicals.

She pointed out that Americans may enjoy having more than one kind of avocado from which to choose.

"People are realizing they like to eat more than one kind of avocado," she said.

She added that most grocery stores stock both kinds of avocado.

She sees the green avocado business and the Haas avocado business as separate.

Colombian avocados are not likely to hurt Florida's avocado business.

"I guess we have staked out our own little corner," Ostlund said.
