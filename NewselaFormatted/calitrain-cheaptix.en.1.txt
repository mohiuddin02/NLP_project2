<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20150526_Bullet_fare.png" /> LOS ANGELES — Seven years ago, supporters of California's bullet train from Los Angeles to San Francisco wrote in a ballot that a ride on the train would cost "about $50 a person."

Voters then approved billions in funding for the project.

In the years since, the state high-speed rail agency has projected the fare would be $83, $105 and, most recently, $86.

The current price estimate still would be one of the world's cheapest high-speed rail trips on a per-mile basis, a Los Angeles Times analysis found.

As a practical matter, no one can say how much a ride on the bullet train would actually cost if and when the system becomes fully operational.

The state says the train should be running full-time in 2028.

At that point, ticket prices will be set in consultation with a private company hired by the California High-Speed Rail Authority to operate the system, said Jeff Morales, CEO of the state rail agency.

Fares will be one of the most important factors in the decisions that millions of travelers will make when choosing to fly, drive or ride the bullet train.

And they are central to revenue calculations for a system that by state law must operate without extra money from taxpayers.

Morales and other state officials say the system will quickly become profitable.

But critics and some experts warn that long-range financial and ridership forecasts can be unreliable, and the high-speed train could prove to be a financial burden on the state.

Whenever you try to make predictions more than five years away, you are just guessing, said Lisa Schweitzer, who teaches classes about transportation and urban planning at the University of Southern California (USC).

"So many things can change dramatically in five years," she said.

According to official ridership estimates, between 18 million and 31 million passengers annually will board the train in its early years.

The project's most recent business plan predicts that by 2030, ticket sales will hit $2 billion a year.

That figure would be roughly $700 million a year more than operating expenses.

Even at the low end of ridership projections, state officials say, revenues will more than cover operating costs.

The current $86 fare is based on a formula that prices tickets at 83 percent of average airline fares.

The price is just an average of what different types of tickets would cost.

A premium same-day nonstop trip would cost more than $86.

But compared with current average prices on high-speed rail systems in Asia and Europe, $86 would be a bargain, equating to about 20 cents a mile or less, the Los Angeles Times found.

The analysis was based on a 438-mile route.

The average fare on Italy's 434-mile bullet train from Milan to Salerno was 25 cents a mile.

The fare on China's 809-mile line between Beijing and Shanghai was 22 cents per mile.

China discloses little about its high-speed rail finances.

Many experts say the state gives a lot of extra money to help reduce fares, as do many other foreign operators.

The French bullet train from Paris to Lyon is often cited as a line that is profitable.

However, it has a fare of 52 cents a mile.

The German bullet train from Hanover to Wurzburg charges 46 cents a mile.

Amtrak's Acela system on the East Coast is the closest thing to high-speed rail now operating in the United States.

It charges an average of about 50 cents a mile for the 454-mile trip between Washington and Boston.

Louis Thompson is the chairman of a state-created review panel for the bullet train project.

He said California's projected fares are low by world standards.

Thompson's panel is pressing the state to clarify how fares will be set and other key business decisions will be made in the future.

The authority expects to generate additional revenue from things like advertising and concession fees at stations.

But some outside experts questioned whether California's bullet train fares will be able to cover the system's full operating costs.

"The train will lose money and require" money from the state, said Joseph Vranich, former president of the national High-Speed Rail Association.

"I have not seen a single number that has come out of the California high-speed rail organization that is credible.

As a high-speed rail advocate, I am steamed."

William Grindley, a former World Bank executive and an opponent of the project, has warned that the system will fail to make money or even pay off its costs unless demand skyrockets and ticket prices increase.

"Can the proposed California bullet train break even?

The answer is unequivocally no," he said.

Grindley wrote a 2012 report — updated last year — that concluded the system would require extra state money "forever," in the range of $123 million to $1 billion or more annually.

Morales, the rail authority's chief executive officer, said past analyses by Grindley's group have been wrong and included errors in deciding the operating costs of foreign systems.

He said his agency's ridership forecasts have been checked and approved by a panel of outside experts.

In a series of reports, the outside panel has praised the ridership estimates, calling them "commendably high quality" in one report, and urging improvements other times.

"When we say we can hit the break-even point, we have a lot of reliability in the statement," Morales said.
