The train is called a bullet train.

If they build the train, it could take people from San Francisco to Los Angeles in only a few hours.

No one is sure yet how much a ride on the Californian bullet train will cost.

The train is not expected to be done until 2028.

Then the prices will be set using a private company, said Jeff Morales.

He is in charge of the California High-Speed Rail Authority.

His group is working on the train.

Californians voted to have the train seven years ago.

They decided to give a lot of state money to the train project.

When they voted, they were told a ride from Los Angeles to San Francisco would cost about $50.

Now the price has changed to $86.

It could change again.

The bullet train is very expensive to build.

The state law says the train has to be paid for with money from tickets.

The people who run the train cannot ask the California government for extra money.

Still, the train will be cheap compared to train rides in Europe.

It will also be cheaper than train rides in other parts of the United States.

People looking to travel around California will have choices.

They will look at how expensive train tickets are.

They might choose to fly or drive.

Some experts say it can be hard to say what people will do in 2028.

If people do not ride the train, the state would have to keep giving the train more money.

Whenever you try to predict things more than five years away, you are just guessing, said Lisa Schweitzer.

She is a transportation expert.

Things can change a lot in five years, she said.

The train builders expect millions of passengers to ride the train each year.

State officials say the cost to build the train will be paid off very quickly using money from passengers.

Some outside experts are worried.

The train will cost a lot to build.

It will also cost a lot to run.

William Grindley is a business expert.

He does not like the high-speed train project.

Grindley said the system will lose money unless ticket prices go up a lot and many people ride the trains.

He said the bullet train definitely will not make money.

Morales said Grindley's opinion is wrong.

He said outside experts have looked at the state's predictions.

Those experts think the state is right about many people riding the bullet train, according to Morales.
