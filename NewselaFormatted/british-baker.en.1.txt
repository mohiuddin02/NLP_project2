"The Great British Bake Off," a televised baking contest for amateur pastry chefs, has become one of the most popular shows in Britain.

Nadiya Hussain, the show's latest winner, has become an icon.

Hussain beat out two other finalists and was crowned winner of the contest on a program Wednesday night that was watched by 13.4 million people, one-fifth of the British population.

She is also an immigrant and a practicing Muslim who wears a traditional headscarf.

Famous for her baking abilities, she has also become a symbol of Britain's immigrant communities.

Hussain said on Thursday that winning the show was "one of the best moments of my life."

She said she made her winning creation, which she dubbed her "big fat British wedding cake," because she didn't have a cake when she got married in Bangladesh 10 years ago.

Millions of fans followed Hussain's progress through the series.

They winced when her vol-au-vents, a tricky French pastry, failed to come together.

They gasped at her impressive chocolate peacock cake.

Her victory on Wednesday over 41-year-old photographer Ian Cumming and 30-year-old doctor Tamal Ray was widely celebrated.

For many, Hussain represents the face of 21st-century Britain.

In recent years, more and more immigrants have become part of the British population.

As a result, British culture has become more varied, even as many British traditions continue to be passed on.

Since it first aired in 2010, "Bake Off" has been reflecting these changes.

Contestants bake old-fashioned British treats, but the contestants themselves are gay and straight, male and female and from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds.

One fan of "Bake Off" is Prime Minister David Cameron.

He backed Hussain to win and called Britain the "proudest multi-racial democracy on Earth" in a speech Wednesday.

Others in Britain have a less favorable view of immigration.

In the last decade, hundreds of thousands of newcomers have arrived from all over the world, and they have not always been warmly welcomed.

An anti-immigrant political party known as the U.K.

Independence Party has gained millions of votes in local and national elections.

Meanwhile, Theresa May, a government minister, gave a speech this week in which she said that mass immigration was incompatible with a united society.

Muslim immigrants are often singled out.

Certain extreme Muslim groups have committed large-scale violence in recent years.

As a result, Britain's 2.7 million Muslims are viewed with suspicion by some, even though the vast majority of Muslims worldwide are peaceful.

As a Muslim immigrant, and Britain's new "Bake Off" champion, Hussain has made her community proud.

The Muslim Association of Britain said her victory "has demonstrated the connection that young British Muslims have with British society."

It is somewhat surprising that the slightly hokey "Bake Off" has become such a cultural sensation.

Contestants toil over baking challenges in a large tent on the lawn of an elegant country house.

They then present their creations for judgment to cookbook writer Mary Berry and master baker Paul Hollywood.

Two hosts, comedians Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc, add encouragement and humor.

Unlike most reality shows, the tone is supremely good-natured.

The show had a modest start, but ratings rose from about 3 million viewers for the first season to 10 million by the fifth.

Every weekly episode is the subject of conversation on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter.

Sales of baking books and cake pans have soared as a result of the show's popularity.

The format has even been copied in other countries, including Australia, Sweden, Turkey, France and the United States.

Josh Abrams is a lecturer at London's Roehampton University who specializes in food and performance.

He described "Bake Off" as perfect for an "age when we're all digitized and spending so much of our time in front of screens."

He thinks the old-fashioned tone of the show is refreshing for people.

"The idea of getting your hands dirty — whether physically in the dirt of your back yard or mixing things in a kitchen — speaks to a nostalgia for a notion of a simpler time," he said.
