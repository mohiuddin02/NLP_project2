North Korea does not get along with its neighbors in Asia.

In fact, it is cut off from most of the outside world.

Now, it has become even more cut off.

North Korea now has its own time zone.

Time zones are a way of adjusting for time differences between countries.

When it is day in one part of the world, it is night in another.

It would not make sense to say it was noon everywhere.

The sun would be high in the sky in some places.

In other places, it would have already set hours earlier.

Within a particular time zone, it is the same time everywhere at a certain hour.

Other time zones are either ahead or behind.

The farther apart time zones are, the bigger the difference in time.

For example, imagine that it is noon in New York City.

At the very same time, it would be 6 p.m. in Paris, France.

Each time zone is set according to Greenwich Mean Time.

The others are either ahead or behind Greenwich Mean Time.

Greenwich Mean Time takes its name from Greenwich, England.

Some countries are so big they have more than one time zone.

For example, the continental United States has four.

On the other hand, smaller countries that are next to each other often use the same time zone.

North Korea was using the same time zone as South Korea and Japan.

The three countries were nine hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time.

Now, North Korea will be 30 minutes behind the other two.

The switch to a new time zone happened on Aug. 15 at midnight.

Bells rang as the nation's clocks were set back.

Crowds of North Koreans cheered.

The day of the switchover was chosen for an important reason.

Korea was ruled by Japan for 35 years.

The country finally won its freedom on Aug. 15, 1945, at the end of World War II.

Just three years later, North Korea split off from South Korea.

They have been two different countries ever since.

North and South Korea do not get along well.

Still, some South Koreans are praising the North for making the change.

North Korea has actually returned to a time zone Korea used long ago.

Korea began using that time zone in 1908.

However, two years later the Japanese took over Korea.

In 1912, the Japanese switched the country over to the Japanese time zone.

Many Koreans are still very angry at the Japanese.

Even in South Korea, many are happy about the time zone change.

It makes them proud to see Koreans get rid of something the Japanese forced on them.

North Korea has named the new time zone "Pyongyang Time."

Pyongyang is the nation's capital city.

North Korean scientist Jong Sok praised the change.

Now when the sun is at the highest point, it will be noon, he said.

Before, the time was a bit off.

Pyongyang Time is "the same as our ancestors used," Jong said.

It was "robbed from us by the Japanese."

North Korea said the South should not stick with the Japanese time zone either.

Instead, it should follow the North's example.

North Korea has more than its own time zone.

It also has its own way of counting the years.

Instead of 2015, this is Juche 104 on North Korean calendars.

The calendar begins from the birth of the country's first president, Kim Il Sung.

Dates before that are the same as in Western countries, such as the United States.
