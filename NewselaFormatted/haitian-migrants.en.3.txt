Thousands of people are leaving the Dominican Republic for Haiti.

They are Haitians, who have lost their chance to live in the Dominican Republic.

Many of them were born in the Dominican Republic or had lived there for many years.

Haiti and the Dominican Republic share the Caribbean Island of Hispaniola.

The deadline has already passed.

Many of them are not waiting around to see if the country will actually force them to leave.

Both countries have a difficult history.

Haiti is a very poor country.

Generations of Haitians have crossed into the Dominican Republic to take low-paying jobs like farming and construction work.

They have also been treated unfairly because their skin color is darker than the people from the Dominican Republic.

Among those who have left the Dominican Republic is Haitian farmworker Eragene Moncher.

He actually could stay in the country.

Yet he returned to Haiti because he could not get the papers for five of his children to stay in the Dominican Republic.

The children were all born there.

"We're arriving with nothing," Moncher said, getting on a truck with two of his children bound for the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince.

"I'm trying to figure out how we're going to make a living."

Dominican officials say Haitians in the country could stay if they prove they arrived before October 2011.

Nearly 290,000 of the estimated 524,000 migrants in the country had applied to stay by the June 17 deadline.

The government says those who did not apply or get legal permission to stay should leave.

Otherwise, they could be forced to leave.

The Dominican government says nearly 40,000 people had left as of July 6.

Many people going to Haiti say they are leaving because they are afraid of being kicked out of the country.

Violent deportations have happened in the past.

The Haitians also say they are frustrated.

The government told them they had to get papers they were unable to actually get.

Haitians said it was difficult to apply for permission to stay.

They had to find seven neighbors to say they were living in the country before October 2011.

There also were delays and high costs to get birth certificates and other documents from the Haitian government.

"It's complicated, you spend a lot of money, and you don't get your papers," said Miguelle Saint Juste, a construction worker.

He was loading suitcases and a TV onto a bus to Haiti with his family.

The Dominican Republic has been criticized for rules that affect mostly Haitians.

Pedro Cano is with the Jesuit Migrant Service.

It is a group that helps the Haitian migrants.

He said being forced out of the country can be very upsetting.

The Haitians have spent years, sometimes their entire lives, in the Dominican Republic.

They would "lose the meager belongings they've earned after many years and much sacrifice," he said.

Some Dominican officials had warned they would search for immigrants.

They also showed off buses to send them to Haiti.

No Haitians have been forced to take them, though.

The situation has caused problems between the two countries.

Haitian Prime Minister Evans Paul has accused Dominican officials of treating people badly.

Paul said 21 migrants, including eight children, were taken to Haiti on a 15-hour journey without a break to eat or drink.

The Dominican government denied this.

Moncher, the farmworker, said that after going back to Haiti, he would stay temporarily with a sister.

He hopes his relatives can help him find work there.

More than half of the people in Haiti survive on less than $2 a day.

"Who knows if they'll receive me?"

he said.

"They don't have anything to offer."
