She wants to be in the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.

But pursuing her dream takes hard work.

So one day this summer, she was at a training center in Illinois.

Evans was wearing a purple top and black tights.

She had pale turquoise sneakers with purple shoelaces.

In bobsledding, teams of two or four jump into a sled.

They race down a narrow, twisting track trying to get the best time.

The pusher has to be strong enough to get the sled off to a fast start.

She did a lot of exercises.

She lifted weights and flipped a 400-pound tire.

The most eye-catching of all were her box jumps.

In box jumps, you start by sitting.

Then you jump forward onto a pile.

Evans jumped to the top of a pile that was 4 feet, 3 inches high.

That's pretty good for someone her size.

She is 5 feet, 10 inches tall and weighs 175 pounds.

Evans did not know much about bobsledding growing up in Chicago.

She learned more about it during the 2010 Winter Olympics.

Her track coach, Mike Erb, noticed she could run and jump and was as strong as the people who pushed bobsleds at the games.

He encouraged her to try it.

She heard about bobsled tests in the summer of 2012.

She went and got the highest score.

She stunned everyone by being the best at pushing bobsleds on dry land.

Three months later, Evans was about to ride the bobsled for the first time.

She was going to sit in the back of a 375-pound sled for about 50 seconds.

The sled goes faster than 70 miles per hour.

That is about the speed of a car on the highway.

Bonny Warner was in the Olympics three times on another kind of sled.

One time she described what happens when a bobsled goes by.

"The ground shakes," she said.

She said steering it was like trying to drive an overloaded truck.

The bobsleds, she said, sound like a train in a tunnel.

Evans does not even like roller coasters.

After the first practice run, Evans wondered what she was doing there.

She called her mother, Sequocoria Mallory.

She encouraged her to try again.

Evans decided if she made it through that second run, she would stick with it.

The whole way down, she was thinking, "It's worth it, it's worth it, it's worth it."

It won't be easy to win a spot for the Olympics.

But Evans had a perfect score at the bobsled tests.

And she was the best pusher two years in a row.

Pushing comes at the beginning of a bobsled race.

The driver and pusher push for a little while.

Then they jump into the sled.

The pusher sits with her head down and tries not to move her upper body, which could move the sled off line.

It was special to Evans when she won her last match of the season in Sochi, where the Olympics will be held.

It still makes her eyes teary when she talks about it.

Evans' grandfather, Lemorse Mallory, had always supported her.

But he died six days before the race, and she wanted to be back with her family in Chicago.

Evans' mother persuaded her to stay.

Her grandfather would have wanted her to, she said.

Evans said she is proud she was able to fight all of those feelings and do well.

It made her even more excited to return this season.

"I feel like I have gotten through the hard part," she said.
