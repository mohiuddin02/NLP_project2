Very old-time baseball.

They play the sport like it was played in the 1800s.

The players pitch underhand.

Nobody uses a batting helmet.

There are no fielding gloves, or even a catcher's mask.

A man wearing a suit and tie yells "Striker to the line!"

What he means is: "Batter up!"

This is not your father's baseball.

It's not even your grandfather's baseball.

It's your great-great-grandfather's game.

The Athletic Base Ball Club of Philadelphia plays this way.

More teams are joining them.

They play in old-fashioned uniforms.

Teams use rules from the 1800s.

The players all have funny nicknames.

And "baseball" is two words.

"It brings people back to a simpler time," said Bruce Leith.

He runs the Mid-Atlantic Vintage Base Ball League.

His nickname is "Early."

He's never early to anything of course.

Leith is also president of the Eclipse Base Ball Club of Elkton, Maryland.

Eight years ago, he said, there were only three teams in that area.

Today there are 14.

People often say the game was invented in 1839 by Abner Doubleday.

The story was that Doubleday invented it in Cooperstown, New York.

But experts have done research.

They now say Alexander Cartwright and the Knickerbocker Base Ball Club of New York City began to write the rules down in the 1840s.

Those rules were changed many times.

So, today's old-fashioned teams have many old rulebooks to choose from.

The Mid-Atlantic league plays by what are called the 1864 rules.

One of the biggest differences between then and now is that fielders could catch a batted ball on one bounce to make an out.

Now players have to catch it from the air.

The old rule makes sense.

Players back then were trying to catch a hard ball without gloves.

Baseball gloves didn't become common until later.

The Athletic club is named after an old Philadelphia team.

The club formed about five years ago.

Scott "Big Deal" Alberts helped form it.

Alberts started researching the sport's long history in the city.

His teammates are called "ballists."

They are all different ages.

Some are more athletic than others.

They work at different jobs during the week.

The team plays once a week.

They try to do everything exactly as it was done in the past.

Their wool uniforms cost about $300.

They have fancy buttons, bow ties and square-like caps.

Home plate is a white disc and the bases are sand-filled bags.

"We try to do everything we can as close as possible" to the 1800s,  Alberts said.

"Because if we're not doing that, we might as well just be playing softball in the park."

Arthur and Alice Best had a special reason to enjoy a recent Athletic game.

The Bests happen to be people who like to dress up in Civil War clothes.

They recreate Civil War battles.

They try to make everything look as real as possible, just like the players.

Alice Best said she "loved" that the players try to follow history.

She noticed them drinking out of tin cups.

"And they have their bats in a barrel, or on an old wooden rack," she said.

"It's really, really nice."

Not all teams care about being so true to history, said Dennis "Pops" Wiegmann.

He is president of the National Vintage Base Ball Association.

The group has about 65 active clubs.

He figures there are dozens of other teams out there that are not in the association.

But all share a common goal.

They want exercise and to have fun with a historical twist.

"It gives people another way of looking at the game," Wiegmann said.
