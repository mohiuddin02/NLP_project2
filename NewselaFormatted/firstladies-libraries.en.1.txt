<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20140918_Pres_LIBRARIES.jpg" />CHICAGO — When a president leaves office, a library is built to preserve documents and historical materials from his time in the White House.

The first presidential library was a small room where Sarah Polk placed important letters and objects belonging to her late husband, President James Polk.

Today, presidential libraries are multimillion-dollar complexes that house thousands of official records.

Modern presidential libraries are not just concerned with the men who have occupied the White House, however.

They also showcase the work and lives of presidents' spouses, traditionally known as "first ladies."

Richard Norton Smith, a presidential scholar, explained that first ladies have become more prominently featured in presidential libraries.

"Her story is being more fully integrated with that of her spouse — just like in real life," he said.

That way, Smith said, libraries can capture the partnership between president and first lady.

Moreover, libraries are doing more to recognize the important roles that first ladies play.

Recent first ladies have led public campaigns to improve education and health, for example.

First ladies are also often national figures.

When they connect with the American public, they earn a place in history separate from their husbands.

It makes sense that presidential libraries are starting to document first ladies' lives and work.

Many of these women actually lead the way in planning and constructing the libraries.

Michelle Obama is an example of a first lady who is actively engaged in developing her husband's library.

She will assist in choosing where the library will go, raising private funds to build it, and deciding what it will look like after it is completed.

The work she has done as first lady will also be recorded.

A spokeswoman for the Obama foundation said Michelle Obama's public service "will be prominently featured in the library."

The first lady's involvement in presidential libraries varies from president to president.

Likewise, some libraries feature first ladies more prominently than others.

Although she did not play a major role in overseeing its design, Hillary Rodham Clinton is featured in at least two permanent exhibits in the library of her husband, President Bill Clinton.

An exhibit called "Putting People First" highlights her efforts to reform health care.

Another exhibit focusing on education includes several awards that she received.

First lady Laura Bush was a driving force behind President George W. Bush's library.

She chaired the library's design committee and helped select Southern Methodist University in Dallas as the site.

According to Sally McDonough, Laura Bush's press secretary at the White House, the first lady stepped naturally into her leadership role.

As a former librarian with a master's degree in library science, she was well-prepared to oversee the project.

"It's hard to look at the presidential center and not think of the touches she was involved in, from the location on campus to the landscape surrounding it," McDonough said.

When things needed tweaking, Laura Bush was the one to do it.

For example, she found it jarring to leave the section on the education program No Child Left Behind and go straight into an exhibit focusing on the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.

She thought it would be especially upsetting for children.

As a solution, she added a reading nook stocked with some of her favorite books so that children could stay behind and read as their parents went through.

Michelle Obama, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Laura Bush are modern examples of an old trend.

First ladies have long helped to preserve the historical materials of their husbands.

Sarah Polk created a shrine and museum in her home dedicated to her late husband, President James Polk.

She made sure that his historical objects, portraits and papers were available to the public.

First lady Lucretia Garfield took it a step further.

She added a wing to her home that included a fireproof research room and a vault to hold her late husband's presidential papers.

While many first ladies, including Nancy Reagan, Rosalynn Carter, Betty Ford and Lady Bird Johnson, were involved with their husband's libraries, Jacqueline Kennedy may have had the most direct role.

President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963 — after just more than 1,000 days in office — so the entire job of establishing the library fell to her.

"That became for her a very primary mission, almost from right after he was assassinated," said Carl Sferrazza Anthony, historian at the National First Ladies' Library.

"She was responsible for fundraising, choosing the architect, developing the exhibits and choosing which of the president's personal objects would go on display."

Today, first ladies continue to play large roles in overseeing presidential libraries.

According to Jeremy Mayer, a political science professor at George Mason University, this is part of a larger trend.

First ladies have taken on larger roles in developing and carrying out presidential policies in recent decades.

There may be another reason that first ladies often play such large roles in presidential libraries.

Mayer observes that the fact that women tend to live longer than men may have something to do with it.

"Given the life span of women versus men, women are typically outliving the presidents," Mayer said.

As a consequence, first ladies often take on the role of preserving their husband's memories.
