It was almost midnight.

The family was woken up after hearing a government helicopter.

They followed the sound of the helicopter's whirring blades.

They also listened to scratchy updates from rebels on a walkie-talkie.

Syria is a dangerous place right now.

The government is fighting its own people because many Syrians don't like the current president of Syria.

News came in that the helicopter had dropped two barrel bombs on nearby towns.

Barrel bombs are very powerful and can bring down buildings.

The family knew that the helicopters can carry up to four of the bombs.

They waited for the last two.

Lights came on in basement bunkers as others sought a small measure of protection.

A woman in the family, Khansa Laila, walked out to the balcony.

She wore several layers but still shivered from the cold.

"I woke up from the sound of the alarm, so I'm still cold," she said.

"Also, fear makes you cold."

A series of red streaks from a machine gun shot upward against a starry sky, but the streaks rose and fell without striking their target.

Eventually the sound of the helicopter grew faint and was replaced by that of a warplane.

"We don't take the warplanes seriously anymore," Laila said.

Warplanes launch rockets that hit one target, she said.

"But helicopters drop barrel bombs that can destroy dozens of homes with one barrel."

The family went to sleep that night to the sound of machine-gun fire and the occasional rocket.

It is almost three years into Syria's civil war.

The noise of war has become part of life here in the country's largest city.

Aleppo's neighborhoods are controlled by people who don't like Syria's government.

Government forces have dropped barrel bombs almost every day.

Some say that more than 2,000 people have been killed in these attacks.

Those still in the city have adjusted to enduring most of President Bashar Assad's military might.

In a shoe store, a woman tries on a pair of wedge heels.

She decides that they are not comfortable enough to run away in.

A 1-year-old with curly hair and big brown eyes speaks mostly in mumbles, but one word she knows clearly: "tabit" — it fell.

"A barrel falls and 10 minutes later people return to what they were doing," said a young man named Muhammad.

Hours earlier, a barrel bomb had struck a street.

It hit three vehicles and killed eight people.

With the blood fresh on the sidewalk, motorists stopped and peered at the deadly damage.

The next day people walked by without a glance; the destroyed vehicles had become one more addition to the city's scary backdrop.

"Every day we see the names of the dead scrolling across the TV screen; they've just become numbers," one man said.

"When I was a kid and someone died we mourned for 40 days, the TV could not be turned on.

Now someone dies on one side and you turn around and watch a soap opera."

On a recent day in an Aleppo vegetable market, a warplane's low rumble was heard.

It stopped all business and conversation.

People forgot about the unripe almonds and lettuce.

Everyone turned their faces upward to track the plane by its sound.

People did not return their attention to the everyday particulars of life until the rumble had faded.

The plane was now the concern of another Aleppo neighborhood.

"If it had been a helicopter, they would watch it till it dropped the barrel," Saleh Laila said.

Then "cars would start driving into each other and people would run, trying to get away."

A couple of charred and stripped vehicles mark the entrance of Aleppo.

The helicopters attack day and night along with warplanes and big guns.

There are also regular clashes between government and rebel forces.

The violence has transformed the area from one that was full of people and life into one with entire neighborhoods abandoned.

More than two-thirds of the city's population is estimated to have escaped and gone north.

They go to Turkey.

If they are not allowed into the country, they stay along its border in rundown refugee tents.

As one Aleppo resident said of the city, "There are fighters, activists and shop owners.

No one else is left."
