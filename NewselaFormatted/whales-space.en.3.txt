A satellite has spotted 55 whales hanging out in the waters off Argentina.

It helped that these particular whales are quite easy to spot from space, said Peter Fretwell of the British Antarctic Survey.

The whales are called southern right whales.

They got the name because the big, slow whales were once considered the "right" ones to hunt.

They were so easy to hunt that their numbers dropped to just 300 by the 1920s.

There had been 55,000-70,000 of them in the days before whaling.

Right whales spend a lot of time resting lazily near the surface of calm ocean water.

But that also makes them easy to find by satellite.

Fretwell wrote about using satellites in a paper published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One.

He argues that it's possible to track whales by satellite.

It's also easier than traditional whale tracking.

The traditional way of tracking involved standing on the bridge of a ship and looking out into the ocean.

Or, trackers could glide over the water in an airplane.

But both tracking styles are expensive and take great amounts of time, said Fretwell.

They're also often inaccurate.

Pictures taken by satellite are more correct and cover a wider area, he said.

If this works, he said satellites can be used to track other types of animals.

Fretwell and his fellow scientists purchased a huge picture taken in September 2012 by the WorldView2 satellite.

It covers 70 square miles.

It included an area off the Argentine coast where southern right whales are known to breed.

They also raise their young there from July through November.

The researchers looked at the same picture in different wavelengths.

One was even able to see 50 feet beneath the ocean.

They were able to spot 55 objects that were probably whales.

Another 22 were possibly whales.

They spotted another 13 whale-shapes underwater.

The pictures are far from crystal clear.

And the researchers admit that the satellite system is not perfect.

After all, it is possible that a flock of birds or a large rock could be mistaken for a whale.

What looks like a single whale could actually be a mother whale with a calf.

These uncertainties should go away with time, scientists say.

New satellites will take higher quality pictures.

That will allow scientists to spot whales with greater confidence, the paper said.

Scientists already have used satellites to count populations of penguins in Antarctica, as well as seals.

The key is not the size of the animal but how much it stands out, he said.
