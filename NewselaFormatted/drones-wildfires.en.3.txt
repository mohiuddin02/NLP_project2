Helicopter pilot Jason Thrasher was fighting a fire in California.

All of a sudden, he saw what he thought was another helicopter battling the blaze.

He realized the object was a remote-controlled airplane, called a drone.

It was only 10 feet from his windshield.

He had to turn the helicopter sharply to avoid hitting it, according to a report.

"If that drone came through my windshield, I have no idea what could have happened," Thrasher said.

If the drone hit the tail, the helicopter could have crashed.

The near-miss last September explains why firefighting pilots are worried.

The problems have led to calls for more laws to keep drones away from firefighting aircraft.

Drones are also called unmanned aerial vehicles or UAVs.

They are piloted by onboard computers or remotely by a person on the ground.

This year, there were 13 wildfires in which drones may have gotten in the way of firefighting aircraft.

There were 11 since late June.

Drones got in the way of only four fires last year.

Last month, five drones at a wildfire forced aircraft to land for 20 minutes, while flames spread.

"When you can't support firefighters on the ground, fires get bigger," said Ken Pimlott.

He is the director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

"It's a huge issue."

On Aug. 2, for the second time in three days, an airline pilot reported a drone while approaching a New York airport.

On Aug. 9, four airplanes spotted a drone while landing in New Jersey.

On Aug. 4, a drone got too near a fire in San Diego, California.

The Fire Department pleaded with the drone operator to leave.

They tweeted, "You are interfering" with firefighting.

There is a simple explanation.

Drones are getting cheaper, so more people are buying them.

The Consumer Electronics Association predicts sales in the United States will reach 700,000 this year.

About 430,000 drones were bought last year, compared to 128,000 in 2013.

The group estimates this year's average price for a drone is $149.

Drones cost $349 in 2013.

These laws would fine the drone owners and put them in jail.

The lawmakers also want to let first responders destroy interfering drones.

A first responder is a firefighter or police officer arriving at a fire or crime.

Flying near wildfires is dangerous.

Most drone owners probably do not know that, said Greg McNeal, a Pepperdine University professor and expert on drones.

Others are just reckless, he said.

Drones usually carry cameras, and drone owners may want to get pictures of forest fires in order to sell them.

The U.S. Forest Service reported possible drone sightings this year in 13 wildfires.

California had eight.

Washington state had two.

Colorado, Minnesota and Utah each had one.

A plane trying to put out a fire in California came near a drone on June 24.

That meant four firefighting aircraft had to be grounded for 2 1/2 hours.

An airplane spotted a drone on July 11.

Pat McCabe is with the U.S. Forest Service.

he was seated next to the pilot.

McCabe saw the drone land about 3 miles from the fire.

It was loaded onto an SUV.

Its driver sped away.

The Federal Aviation Administration states that drones should fly no higher than 400 feet.

They should stay away from stadiums and people.

They also should avoid flying within 5 miles of airports.

During wildfires and other emergencies, they cannot fly.

Jon Resnick works for SZ DJI Technology Co.

It one of the largest drone makers.

People need to have common sense, he said.
