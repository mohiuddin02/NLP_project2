Belen Sisa lives in Gilbert, Arizona.

Fifteen years ago she came to the United States from Argentina, a country in South America.

Sisa is now 21 years old.

She says it is time to change the language used to describe immigrants, people who come to live in America from other countries.

Many are workers or students from other countries.

Sisa says that the terms "alien" and "illegal alien" should not be used to describe immigrants from other countries.

The word "alien" is also used to describe a creature from another planet.

She said that being called an alien makes her feel as if "I'm not a human in the eyes of other people."

Sisa said that not calling immigrants "aliens" would be a big step to showing them more respect.

She may soon get her wish.

A new bill is being talked about in Congress, which makes U.S. laws.

It says that "alien" should be not be used by the government.

If members of Congress vote for the bill, it would become a law.

Joaquin Castro is a member of Congress from Texas.

He introduced the new bill, which is called the Correcting Hurtful and Alienating Names in Government Expression (CHANGE) Act, on Oct. 21.

Many other members of Congress are backing the bill.

Groups that support immigrants are backing it, too.

Roger Rocha Jr. is president of one of the largest Hispanic groups in the United States.

He said that the term is used by people who want to put others down.

He said the bill is important to changing how people think.

He noted that almost three-quarters of Americans support changing immigration laws.

This is not the first time there have been laws about words that some people found painful.

In 2010 and 2012 laws were passed suggesting less hurtful ways of describing people with illnesses and disabilities.

Raul Grijalva is a member of Congress from Arizona, and he also backs the bill.

He said the issue of immigration and civil rights are closely connected.

"The language and the racism demeans you," he said.

"It makes you less than a full American."

Sisa said the word has touched her personally.

When applying for a job, she said, an interviewer told her she is an "alien" and asked if she was even allowed to try for the job.

She said she understands why there needs to be words to describe immigrants.

Even so, she hopes that the bill encourages the government to use language that shows more respect.

"It would mean that we're taking a step forward," Sisa said of the bill.

That is just the message lawmaker Castro is trying to get across.

"Words matter," he said.
