Workers for restaurants like McDonald's and Taco Bell came together on Tuesday.

They protested in front of restaurants.

Protestors held signs.

Some shouted.

The workers want a raise.

They want more money for the work they do.

They want $15 an hour.

Tuesday's protests were not just about restaurants.

They were part of a larger fight.

The bigger fight is about the minimum wage.

It is called the "Fight for $15."

"Fight for $15" is for many kinds of workers.

It is about paying workers more money.

The minimum wage is set by law.

It says how much money all workers must get.

Workers can be paid more than that.

They cannot be paid less.

The minimum wage is $7.25 an hour.

The workers want to raise it to $15.

The raise would not be only be for restaurant workers.

Many other workers would get it too.

The U.S. will pick a new president next year.

Right now many people are running.

Such people are called candidates.

People vote for the candidate they want.

Whoever gets the most votes wins.

On Tuesday, protesters had a message for the candidates.

You must agree with the increase, they said.

If you do not, we will not vote for you.

Protests took place at many restaurants.

Groups gathered in more than 270 cities.

Dominique McCrae was outside a McDonald's in Durham, North Carolina.

McCrae is 23.

She works at a Bojangles' restaurant.

She gets $7.55 an hour.

McCrae has a young child to take care of.

Her pay is just not enough, she said.

Workers just want to take care of their families, said McCrae.

They need more money.
