Rainbow Sky Buck moved to the state of Utah this summer.

Soon after, she went to the hospital with a painful ear infection.

While she was at the hospital, she got some bad news.

The state of Utah would not pay for her to see the doctor.

In fact, it would not pay for any of her care if she did not feel well.

When Buck lived in California, she was a foster youth.

She was a young person who did not live with her biological parents.

Because of this, the state of California paid her doctor bills through a program called Medicaid.

The program provides free health care to Americans who do not have much money.

Now that she lived in another state, Buck would have to pay the bill herself.

She used all of the money she had in the bank and even had to borrow more money.

"Luckily, I got my antibiotics and I am OK now," she said.

"But what is going to happen next time?"

Foster youths can get free health care until they turn 26.

If they move to another state, however, there might be problems.

Not all states want to continue paying these costs.

Some lawmakers in Washington, D.C., are trying to change things.

They do not want to see people lose their free health care, even if they move.

They are trying to make a new law that would allow people like Buck to keep their free health care until they are 26 years old.

It would not matter what state they move to.

First Focus is a group that helps foster youths.

It has been hearing from young people who are worried about their health costs.

Many did not realize the government would stop paying their doctor bills when they moved.

"We really do feel an urgency about this," said Shadi Houshyar, who works for the group.

"So many people who have aged out have significant health needs and coverage is so important."

Fatima Morales works for another group that helps children called Children Now.

Morales is trying to let young people know what might happen if they move.

"They need to know how their health coverage might be impacted," she said.

"It's just something that they need to weigh."

Lezlie Martinez is 19 years old.

She is hoping to move from California to Colorado.

She wants to live in a place that is less expensive and her boyfriend is already in Colorado.

Martinez is looking for jobs to support herself and her 2-year-old son.

She has several health problems that need to be treated.

"It is causing foster youth to be stuck in the same state they were raised in," Martinez said.

"It is really stressing me out."

Buck, who moved from California to Utah, thought finding a job would be easier in her new state.

She said she was shocked to learn she would no longer get free health care.

Buck has stopped seeing one of her doctors and no longer takes her medication because she can no longer afford it.

She also worries about getting another ear infection.

If she does, she might not be able to pay for treatment.

"It is just scary to think I am completely on my own," Buck said.

Not long ago, she found a new job, but it does not pay for health care.

"I don't want to leave, but this is almost forcing me to move back to California."
