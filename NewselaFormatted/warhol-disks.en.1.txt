The Andy Warhol Museum, Carnegie Mellon University and the Carnegie Museum of Art — which all had a hand in the project — revealed the story Thursday morning.

Just the possibility that something — anything — new by the King of Pop Art had been discovered was enough to excite Warhol fanatics around the world.

The 28 images were apparently created and stored by Warhol on nearly-unreadable computer disks on his Commodore Amiga computer almost 30 years ago.

They include Warhol's version of "The Birth of Venus" by 15th century artist Sandro Botticelli, a Warhol self-portrait, and a Campbell's soup can.

Warhol was famous for his depictions of soup cans.

Also found on the disk were versions of some of his other most iconic artworks such as a banana and actress Marilyn Monroe.

It will take more research and debate before the find's historic value is clear.

But Matt Wrbican, the Andy Warhol Museum's chief archivist and an expert on Warhol, said the high interest is understandable for one of the world's most productive and studied artists.

"It's something that's new," he said, "and that doesn't happen very often with Warhol."

Within hours of the Warhol discovery hitting the Internet, Wrbican heard from someone who does not believe that Warhol himself created the images on the disk.

A man who worked with the now-closed Amiga World magazine called after reading a story about the discovery Thursday.

He said he "doesn't think Warhol actually made a lot of those images," Wrbican said.

The magazine did a story in 1986 about Warhol and his use of the Amiga computer.

Wrbican said he will talk more with the person who called.

But even if Warhol had help in making the images, they will still help experts understand the artist.

"Like a lot of his work, it was a collaboration," Wrbican said.

Warhol, who predicted  that "everyone would be world-famous for 15 minutes," is a Pittsbugh-born artist who died in 1987 in New York City.

Still famous today, his paintings now fetch more than $100 million at auctions.

Even if Warhol had created the images all by himself, Wrbican noted, "I want to emphasize we're not calling these artwork.

It was just Warhol learning a new tool."

The museum knew it had Warhol's Amiga computer and floppy disks for some time, Wrbican said.

Floppy disks were computer storage devices that held information, and even a computer's entire operating system, but are now obsolete.

Wrbican said he had wanted to look through Warhol's computer and set of disks for a while, but couldn't find the time.

It took a modern-day, multimedia artist — and self-professed Warhol fanatic — to finally get the ball rolling.

New York City-based artist Cory Arcangel was about to do a show at the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh in 2011.

The show's curator, Tina Kukielski, asked him if he had any ideas for any Pittsburgh-focused work.

Commodore used the video to promote the Amiga, the first advanced multimedia art graphics computer.

"It was always unclear to me if (Warhol) had an Amiga and if he had any disks with work on them," Arcangel said.

Arcangel then called his friend Golan Levin to see if he knew anyone with any retro-computer expertise.

Levin is an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon.

As it turns out, the university had an active and energetic Computer Club that has long been interested in outdated computer technology.

The members were not only interested in learning how computer technology evolved, but also what to do about future archiving issues.

"We were not optimistic when we first saw the floppy disks," said Keith Bare, a Carnegie Mellon graduate who was involved in the project.

They were system disks, not personal "disks with something handwritten on them like 'Andy Warhol's images' on them."

It turned out the disks, as well as the computer they were created on, were early versions, which made accessing the systems that much more difficult.

But by creating their own program — and also using a program called a KryoFlux to allow a modern computer to interface with a floppy disk — the team managed to pull the images up and save them.

"But I think we're going to have a lot of this in the future unless we start saving files in very standard file formats," said Michael Dile, who was deeply involved in the project.

This goes not just for world famous artists, but individuals, business, government and other organizations that need information which is still on old formats.

People might think that new computer images by Warhol could be sold by the museum for a lot of money.

But Wrbican said even if Warhol did create them, it's not so easy to begin printing Warhol's newly found work.

The museum might not even be able to use the Marilyn Monroe image found on the computer, for example, he said.

The people who own the rights to Monroe's image might sue the museum if it did.

Anyone who wants to use the actress's picture may need to get permission from her heirs.

And similar copyright issues plague much of his work because of the way he used publicly available images or products.

Moreover, Wrbican said, "We don't really see them as Warhol's artwork, so I don't think we're going to be putting them out there on coffee cups to sell any time soon."
