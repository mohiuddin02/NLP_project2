Grown-ups in China must visit their mothers and fathers.

It's the law.

If an old person feels their children don't come home enough, they can take their grown child to court.

Grandparents are important in China.

They have always been treated with a lot of respect.

When people grew old, their children let them move in.

Their children and grandkids would take care of them until they died.

But things are changing.

China is growing richer.

There are more jobs for young Chinese people.

They often move to cities or countries far away.

Grandparents feel left behind.

Newspapers wrote about the bad treatment of older people.

One newspaper wrote that a grandmother was forced to live with pigs.

China's leaders saw what was happening.

They decided to make the new law.

The court can order children to go visit their parents more.

The law may help people like Yan Meiyue.

Yan is 90 years old.

She said her 72-year-old daughter doesn't visit.

Yan is all alone.

Her husband died 10 years ago.

She now spends every weekday at a community center near her home.

Yan plays a board game with other old people.

Volunteers make meals for them.

"The volunteers keep us company," Yan said with a smile.

People like Yan are called orphan grandparents in China.

One of Yan's neighbors is Ma Qiaoying.

She is 82 years old.

Ma said her two sons live in other countries.

They only visit her once a year.

Ma said that she looks to other old people for company.

"We're like a big family," she said.

"We can talk to each other and share our problems."

Some are wondering why China's leaders made the law.

Are they worried about loneliness?

Or, are they worried about how much money it costs to care for all the old people?

Chen Honglin is a college teacher.

Chen thinks the law will save China money.

If people take better care of their parents, the government won't have to pay for so many community centers.
