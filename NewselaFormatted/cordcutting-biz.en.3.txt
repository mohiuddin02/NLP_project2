American kids are changing the way they are entertained.

They are watching less cable TV.

In fact, they do not really even need a television.

They watch Internet videos on their smartphones and tablets instead.

YouTube and Netflix are two of their favorite websites.

Kirsten Larsen is 12 years old and Soren Larsen is 15.

They do not turn on the TV before school.

On weekdays, they get up early and pull out their cellphones.

They watch YouTube.

This is the way they get the information they need before meeting up with their friends.

Young people have been moving away from television for a number of years, but now the change is a big deal, said Terence Burke of KidSay.

The company does reports on the viewing habits of all ages of kids.

"Kids still watch TV.

They still head to Disney and Nickelodeon," he said.

They just do not do it for as long.

Smarty Pants is another company that does similar studies.

It has a yearly study on the online behavior of kids ages 6 to 12.

It found that eight out of 10 kids who are 6 to 8 years old watch YouTube.

Three-quarters of 9- to 12-year-olds use it too.

The same number of 9- to 12-year-olds watch Netflix, the report said.

Many younger children do as well.

There is an endless choice of funny videos on YouTube.

Some are even educational.

As kids get older, they are watching more on Netflix.

It offers shows with longer stories.

Kids who are 9 to 12 years old often want to watch programs with plots, not just videos.

To attract kids and their parents, YouTube, Netflix and even Amazon have special spaces just for kids.

Those family friendly zones do well with preschoolers and kindergartners.

Older kids want the real thing, though.

YouTube now has a new service.

It is called YouTube Red and costs $10 a month.

There are no ads on YouTube Red.

Kids can also watch when they are offline.

The service will eventually have original programs with YouTube stars.  KidSay reports that YouTube is the most-used cellphone app for boys and girls ages 8 to 11.

It is also their favorite app and top website.

Boys' favorite YouTube channels include "JackSepticEye" and "PewDiePie."

These channels are part of an important group on YouTube.

It has made comedians and people who talk about video games famous.

Young girls have slightly different tastes.

KidSay's survey found that one-third of tween-age girls pick Netflix, Hulu and Amazon as their first choice for watching shows.

YouTube is still a winner with younger girls.

Susan Polizzotto's two daughters Rachel, age 9, and Lauren, 11, watch several YouTube channels.

They use their own iPad tablets.

The kids watch Stampy's Minecraft videos.

They also check out clips on how to paint their nails or do hair.

Their habits are like those of other pre-teen girls.

Pre-teens also love video posts, called vlogs.

"Shaytards" and "Bratayleys" were among their favorite channels in the KidSay survey.

The vlogs are created by real families.

Their real kids are the stars.

Young girls like seeing the families in the vlogs.

It feels more real to them than what is on TV, Burke said.

Now that more teens have cellphones, the move away from watching cable TV is speeding up.

Even many tweens have their own phones and tablets.

Some children as young as 8 years old are also getting their own phones, said Smarty Pants.

Most have their own phone by the time they are 12.

All the kids know how to work the latest technology to be able to watch what is out there.
