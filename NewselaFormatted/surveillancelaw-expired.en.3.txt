No one can listen in on your phone calls anymore â€” for a while, at least.

The National Security Agency (NSA) has lost the right to spy on you.

The NSA hunts for terrorists in the United States.

It relies on something called surveillance to find them.

Surveillance involves secretly looking and listening.

As part of its surveillance, the NSA has been collecting millions of phone calls.

Such phone calls are made by ordinary Americans every day.

The NSA hopes to spot terrorists talking to each other, among all the harmless chatter.

Many people feel that NSA surveillance goes too far.

Americans should not have to worry about being spied on, they say.

A man named Edward Snowden revealed to the public what the NSA has secretly been doing.

Snowden once worked for the NSA.

After Snowden spoke out, people began demanding that surveillance laws be changed.

A new set of surveillance laws called the USA Freedom Act was eventually introduced.

The new act is supported by President Obama.

Under the USA Freedom Act, the NSA will no longer be able to collect phone records.

However, it will still be able to search the records held by phone companies.

The Act passed in the House of Representatives on May 13.

Then, it went on to the Senate, which needs to pass it too before the act can become law.

After that, things got tricky.

A group of senators led by Mitch McConnell announced that they do not like the USA Freedom Act.

They say it makes it too hard for the NSA to keep Americans safe.

They want the NSA to be able to search phone records more quickly and easily than the USA Freedom Act would allow.

The senators would not agree to vote for the bill unless some changes were made to it.

The bill needed to be voted on by Monday to become a law.

Finally, as the deadline approached, McConnell and the others agreed to vote for it after all.

President Obama had strongly urged them not to miss the deadline.

But in the end, the bill did not go through.

A vote was delayed and the deadline passed.

Now there is no law allowing the NSA's surveillance, so collecting phone calls must stop.

What happened was that one senator prevented a Senate vote from taking place.

That man is Rand Paul, who is strongly against NSA surveillance.

Paul is now running for president.

"This is what we fought the Revolution over.

Are we going to so blithely give up our freedom?

...

I'm not going to take it anymore," Paul said.

No new vote is likely before Tuesday at the earliest.

Paul's stand angered many other senators.

Senator John McCain complained bitterly to reporters about Paul's actions.

Paul cares more about running for president than he does about the safety of the nation, McCain said.

Government officials warned that not passing new surveillance laws would be dangerous.

However, they said they were not too worried about a gap of a few days or weeks.

After all, surveillance of known terrorists will still be permitted.

They said the problem will become serious if no new laws are passed.
