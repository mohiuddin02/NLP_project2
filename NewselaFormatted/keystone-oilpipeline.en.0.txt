President Barack Obama announced Friday that he was rejecting the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline project because it wouldn't serve U.S. interests, dismissing its potential economic benefits as insignificant in the long run as he sought to close a long-running chapter in the political fight over global warming.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20151106_Keystone_pipeline.png" /> "For years, the Keystone pipeline has occupied what I frankly consider an overinflated role in our political discourse," Obama told reporters at the White House.

"It became a symbol too often used as a campaign cudgel by both parties rather than a serious policy matter."

The pipeline began as a project nearly a decade ago to carry more than 800,000 barrels of crude oil a day from Canada to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries, a shortcut intended to bring it to market more quickly.

But it grew over time into a political symbol: for opponents, of energy interests run amok, and for backers, of the zealous overreach of environmental advocates.

Opponents long warned about the negative effects of tar sands oil mining on wildlife and people.

Construction of the pipeline would lock the U.S. into dependence on an oil that is destructive and hard to extract, foes said.

Supporters, meanwhile, argued in favor of the economic benefits.

They pointed to the jobs that the construction of the pipeline would create as well as to the stream of North American oil as an important alternative to Middle Eastern sources.

But a State Department study found that the pipeline would create only about 35 permanent jobs after construction was complete.

And fluctuating oil prices affect the economics of tar sands oil, which is difficult and costly to extract.

At various times over the past year, the price of oil dropped below the point that would allow Keystone investors to break even.

The years of fighting obscured the fact that Keystone would "neither be a silver bullet for the economy, as was promised by some, nor the express lane to climate disaster proclaimed by others," Obama said.

His announcement came days after TransCanada, the company building the pipeline, asked that its permit application be put on hold while another challenge to the project played out in Nebraska.

It had become increasingly clear in recent months that Obama would probably reject the pipeline, and TransCanada's request was widely seen as a way to buy time until a more politically friendly atmosphere prevailed, including a new administration moving into the White House after the 2016 presidential election.

Environmentalists "are well aware that the next president could undo all this, but this is a day of celebration," said Bill McKibben, co-founder of the environmental group 350.org, in a statement.

Even as he dismissed the project's potential impact, Obama still argued that rejecting it makes an important statement about the U.S. commitment to fighting climate change.

"We are continuing to lead by example," Obama said.

If world leaders are going to protect the environment, he said, "we're going to have to keep some fossil fuels in the ground rather than burn them."

Obama and other world leaders are expected to agree on significant new efforts to curb global warming during a major international climate summit in Paris next month.

"America," he said, "is going to hold ourselves to the same high standards to which we hold the rest of the world."

Because the pipeline would cross a U.S. border, State Department officials were in charge of the review of the project, and for months the agency had been gathering comments from the public.

But the project had become so highly politicized that the decision about whether to clear or derail it was under consideration at the highest levels of the Obama administration.

Obama said he explained his decision earlier Friday to new Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who supports the pipeline but pledges oversight of its environmental impact.

Obama's decision swiftly drew reaction from across the political spectrum, with leading environmentalists pointing to the effectiveness of organized opposition and promising to fight other projects they see as harmful to the planet.

"The power of the American people decisively beat out the fossil fuel special interests," said Tom Steyer, a California billionaire who has poured tens of millions of dollars into fighting climate change.

"The D.C. establishment once called this pipeline a done deal, but a movement emerged that refused to accept the fossil fuel status quo."

Pipeline backers and political opponents labeled Obama's decision a give-in to special interests.

"Obama today demonstrated that he cares more about kowtowing to green-collar elitists than he does about creating desperately needed, family-supporting, blue-collar jobs," Terry O'Sullivan, president of the Laborers' International Union of North America, said in a statement.

House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., called the long wait for a decision "troubling."

"The president's approach to this process and his ultimate decision reveals a lack of leadership when facing tough issues," McCarthy said in a statement.
