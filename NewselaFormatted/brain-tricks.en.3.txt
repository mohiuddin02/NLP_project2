To the people at the website UFO Sightings Daily, NASA's pictures of Mars are better than a trip to a candy shop.

Every visit offers a new treat.

"Alien critter found on Mars, gazing at rover," one recent headline said.

The website posts what it claims to be UFO pictures.

UFO stands for Unidentified Flying Object.

To many people, that means aliens and flying saucers.

"There is so much evidence of intelligent life in this NASA photo," says the post's author, Scott C. Waring.

NASA is the U.S. space agency.

If you squint at the picture, you can almost see a tiny creature with skinny arms and a pumpkin-shaped head.

It seems to be looking out from behind a rock.

Also spotted were two alien ships, a reptile head and a face looking up.

All that came from just one photo.

In August, some on the Internet thought they saw a crab crawling up a Martian cliff.

In June, others saw a floating rock in the same picture.

Ashwin Vasavada works on the Mars rover project for NASA.

He insists that scientists are not trying to hide evidence of alien life.

"There is no group that would be happier to see such a thing," he said.

Though so far, they have not found aliens.

When people look at space rocks and "see" a crab, or a lizard, or an alien spaceship, they are being tricked, he said.

People are tricked by their own brains.

The phenomenon is called pareidolia.

It explains why some people see what they think looks a man in the moon or pumpkin-headed aliens on Mars.

Pareidolia comes from an ability to spot patterns and find something that looks familiar.

That skill is what lets people recognize things that are important.

It could be the sight of a smiling face, the sound of an alarmed voice or the growl of a predator.

Occasionally, people get it wrong.

Pareidolia comes from the brain's instinct to seek out meaning in unclear or strange images.

That instinct is partly about survival.

When it comes to ending up as someone else's meal, it is usually better to be safe than sorry.

It is also partly social.

Humans are ready to find faces in unfamiliar places.

The ability to recognize an expression is so essential to being human.

Scientist Carl Sagan wrote in "The Demon-Haunted World" that "As soon as the infant can see, it recognizes faces, and we now know that this skill is hardwired in our brains.

Those infants who a million years ago were unable to recognize a face smiled back less, were less likely to win the hearts of their parents," and thrive.

People make fun of those who claim to find aliens in NASA photographs.

Scientists say all humans think this way.

"Human brains are uniquely wired to recognize faces," said Kang Lee.

He is a psychologist who studies the human brain at the University of Toronto.

"So that even when there's only a slight suggestion of facial features, the brain automatically interprets it as a face."

Lee found an area of the brain that turns on when a person sees a face.

It is called the right fusiform gyrus.

Scientists still do not entirely understand how it works.

They know that it is linked to dyslexia.

The learning disorder affects the brain's ability to read letters and numbers.

Even when this area is working, it can lead us to see things that are not there.

Of course, pareidolia is more about what we expect to see than anything that is actually there, said Sophie Scott.

She is a scientist at University College London.

"We really want to see things like faces, we really want to hear things like voices."

Our brains will do just that.
