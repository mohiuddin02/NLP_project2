We know it as a great speech now.

But back then, a Pennsylvania newspaper called the speech "silly."

This week, the newspaper apologized.

Harrisburg's Patriot-News said the article was flawed.

It said the article's author sounded quite full of himself and did not think about how the speech would go down in history.

The newspaper wrote that the people who used to run it may have been influenced by politics.

Or they may have been drinking too much alcohol "as was common in the profession at the time."

The editors back then called President Lincoln's words "silly remarks."

It said the speech deserved to be forgotten.

The newspaper said the editors back then seemed to believe the address was just an ordinary speech.

"Just think: The speech, the exact words of it, are still looked at, thought about and" taken apart, said Michele Hamill of Cornell University.

One of five copies of Lincoln's handwritten speech is on display at Cornell.

It is being shown to celebrate Lincoln giving the address on Nov. 19, 1863.

"He was a very thoughtful writer, and it shows," Hamill said.

She was referring both to the penmanship and the meaning of the speech.

The speech was short.

It took about two minutes to say.

But it is something to remember.

The current Harrisburg editors ran their apology Thursday.

There was also an article explaining the decision to apologize.

Donald Gilliland wrote the article explaining the apology.

He noted that the newspaper's comments about Lincoln's address did not appear until five days after he had delivered it.

Days earlier, the paper had devoted a great deal of coverage to the president's visit to the Pennsylvania city.

The speech was given at the opening of a cemetery to honor Union soldiers killed during the battle there four months earlier.

This isn't the first time a newspaper has apologized many years after the fact.

In 2004, the Lexington Herald-Leader in Kentucky apologized for its failures in covering the civil rights movement in the 1960s.

The Meridian Star in Mississippi printed a similar apology.

It ran the apology when Barack Obama became president in 2009.

The Patriot-News apology lacks the serious tone of those apologies.

But it is no less significant, said Todd Gitlin.

He is a professor of journalism at Columbia University.

The Gettysburg Address was a speech about the country's fight for democracy and equality.

Gitlin said Lincoln's message is as true today as it was then.

He mentioned the current battles over issues such as voter ID laws.

Five copies of the speech exist: two in the Library of Congress, one in the White House, one at the Illinois State Historical Library and one at Cornell.

All are written in Lincoln's neat penmanship, but they contain slight differences.

The copy at Cornell, for example, reads "on this continent" instead of "upon this continent" in the first line.

That sets it apart from the two in the Library of Congress.

Those were written before Lincoln delivered the address.

Lincoln wrote the Cornell copy a few days after the speech.

He was asked to do it by George Bancroft, a historian.

Bancroft wanted to make copies of the document to raise money for wounded soldiers.

Hamill said Lincoln used high-quality paper and special ink and sent it to Bancroft.

But Lincoln had written on both sides of a piece of paper.

Technology did not allow the copying of double-sided documents, and Bancroft asked for another copy.

"Imagine, this is a time of war and you're asking Lincoln again to do this thing," Hamill said.

The president sent Bancroft a fresh copy.

This time he used two pieces of paper.

Bancroft was left with what at the time seemed to be a "piece of useless paper," Hamill said, but he held onto it and left it to his grandson, a chemistry professor at Cornell.

Hamill marveled at the idea that Lincoln had taken the time during the Civil War to write out his speech five times.

And in perfect penmanship.

The Patriot-Union said that with the anniversary of the speech, "the time was ripe" to clear the air.
