It's the start of a new school year, and C.J.

Pearson is busy.

C.J., 13, is hoping to help Ted Cruz become president.

Cruz is a lawmaker from Texas.

Pearson wants Cruz to win the Republican nomination.

Whoever wins the nomination would run for president against a Democrat.

The Democrats are in the White House now.

C.J.

is the leader of the group Teens for Ted.

He wants high schoolers to spread Cruz's ideas to other people who are old enough to vote.

He would also like to persuade their parents to vote for Cruz.

"The Internet allows really anyone to have a voice and build a following, and C.J.

is a great example," said Rick Tyler, who works for Cruz.

"He can make a real difference.

He's kind of the model that we want others to follow."

became famous after he criticized President Barack Obama in a YouTube video.

He received praise from conservative websites.

These websites have many Republican viewers.

Many people started to follow C.J.

on social media websites like Facebook and Twitter.

His writing and videos have become very popular.

C.J.

is an only child.

He lives in Grovetown, Georgia, with his grandparents.

C.J.

said he first became interested in government when he was in first grade.

He liked when his class pretended to vote for a president in 2008.

Last year, he decided he wanted to find a career in government.

He wants to improve education through government.

Someday, he would like to become a lawmaker.

Right now, Pearson is running for re-election as student council president.

The other members of C.J.

's family are Democrats.

They want Vice President Joe Biden to run for president next year.

Even so, C.J.

said, his relatives still support his work with Cruz.

Before his rise to stardom, C.J.

volunteered for several Republicans in his town.

Then he started a group called Young Georgians in Government.

Now, C.J.

is reaching out to other fans of Cruz.

He would like other young people to help him build a national group.

They'll use Twitter and Instagram to urge people to support Cruz.

And those teens can then urge the voters they know to support Cruz.

C.J.

said teens like Cruz because he drives older people crazy.

"He's a bold person.

He's really someone who's led on issues and stood up to everyone," he said.

C.J.

said he likes the fact that Cruz can get a little silly.

Once, he twirled around for the website BuzzFeed.

Another time, he cooked bacon on the barrel of a machine gun for a website called IJ Review.

C.J.

first met Cruz at a meeting of state Republicans.

Afterwards, he contacted someone who worked with Cruz and asked if he could get involved.

The Cruz team made sure C.J.

's family was comfortable with the idea.

Then they welcomed the young teenager on board.
