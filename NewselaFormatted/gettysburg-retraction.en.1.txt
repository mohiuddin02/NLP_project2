Back then, a Pennsylvania newspaper called the speech "silly remarks."

This week, in time for the speech's 150th anniversary, Harrisburg's Patriot-News apologized.

It called the critique "a judgment so flawed, so tainted by hubris, so lacking in the perspective history would bring, that it cannot remain unaddressed in our archives."

With that, the newspaper published an unusual media apology that has captured national attention despite its humorous approach.

It read in part: "Our predecessors, perhaps under the influence of partisanship, or of strong drink, as was common in the profession at the time, called President Lincoln's words 'silly remarks,' deserving 'a veil of oblivion,' apparently believing it an indifferent and altogether ordinary message, unremarkable in eloquence and uninspiring in its brevity."

"Just think: The speech, the exact words of it, are still looked at, thought about and dissected," said Michele Hamill of Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., where one of five copies of Lincoln's handwritten speech is on display through Nov. 23 in remembrance of its delivery on Nov. 19, 1863.

"He was a very thoughtful writer, and it shows," Hamill said.

She was referring both to the penmanship and the substance of the speech, which was short — about two minutes — but memorable.

So too was the disrespect it received in some media, an insult that haunted the Harrisburg editors until their editorial, which ran Thursday with a column explaining the decision to declare: "The Patriot-News regrets the error."

Donald Gilliland, the reporter who wrote the explanatory article, noted that the dismissive comments about Lincoln's address did not appear until five days after he had delivered them.

Days earlier, the paper — then called the Patriot &amp; Union — had devoted extensive coverage to the president's visit to the Pennsylvania city.

The newspaper printed the full text of his speech without editorial comment, Gilliland noted.

Gilliland wrote that the words that appeared on Nov. 24, 1863 earned the newspaper "an enduring place in history for having got Lincoln's Gettysburg Address utterly, jaw-droppingly wrong."

This isn't the first time a newspaper has apologized many years after the fact.

In 2004, the Lexington Herald-Leader in Kentucky apologized for its failures in covering the civil rights movement in the 1960s.

The Meridian Star in Mississippi printed an apology in 2009 when Barack Obama became president, saying in an editorial that it, and many papers across the South, had neglected its duty by not reporting on important civil rights events.

The Patriot-News Gettysburg apology lacks the somber tone of those apologies, but it is no less significant, said Todd Gitlin.

He is a professor of journalism at Columbia University.

He said Lincoln's message — that the nation was in a fight for democracy — is as true today as it was then.

He mentioned the current battles over issues such as voter ID laws, which civil rights activists say are designed to limit minority voting.

Five copies of the speech exist: two in the Library of Congress, one in the White House, one at the Illinois State Historical Library and one at Cornell.

All are written in Lincoln's neat penmanship, but they contain slight differences.

The copy at Cornell, for example, reads "on this continent" instead of "upon this continent" in the famous first line.

That sets it apart from the two in the Library of Congress, which were written before Lincoln delivered the address.

Lincoln wrote the Cornell copy a few days after the speech at the request of George Bancroft, a historian who wanted to make copies of the document to raise money for wounded soldiers.

Hamill said Lincoln used high-quality linen-based paper and special ink.

He sent it to Bancroft, but the effort fell flat.

That's because Lincoln had written on both sides of a piece of paper, and technology did not allow the copying of double-sided documents.

Bancroft asked for another copy.

"Imagine, this is a time of war and you're asking Lincoln again to do this thing," Hamill said.

The president sent Bancroft a fresh copy, using two pieces of paper.

Bancroft was left with what at the time seemed to be a "piece of useless paper," Hamill said, but he held onto it and willed it to his grandson, a chemistry professor at Cornell University.

During the Depression, the document was sold to a New York City dealer.

But it eventually ended up back in Cornell's hands, where it is guarded by a university police officer while it is on display.

Hamill marveled at the idea that a president with a war to run had taken the time to write out his speech five times.

And in perfect penmanship.

The Patriot-Union said that with the anniversary of the speech, "the time was ripe" to clear the air.

"Really, this isn't a question of journalism ethics, as would be the case with a serious retraction," wrote the paper's deputy opinion editor, Matthew Zencey.

"It was more a way of using the 150th anniversary to say, with a wink, 'Gee, can you believe what rock heads ran this outfit 150 years ago?'"
