This may prompt you to snicker.

Don't.

It's not funny, and the fact that nice people avoid talking about human waste contributes to what is an enormous and deadly problem.

In India, for example, the United Nations estimates that more than 600 million people don't use toilets.

They don't use latrines — toilets built over holes in the ground — either.

They go right on the ground.

And that's just one country.

While significant improvement has occurred in the past 20 years, an estimated 1 billion people worldwide still go in the open.

Another 700 million use unhygienic facilities such as "hanging latrines" that dump directly into streams, or buckets that may simply be emptied in the streets.

All told, estimates of annual deaths from diarrhea, the majority of them caused by feces-contaminated water, range as high as 1.5 million.

Most of the victims are under 5 years old.

"The statistics about the number of children that die every day from diarrhea-related diseases are shocking," said Robert Zimmerman, a Kohler engineer.

Can Kohler help?

The company is better known for producing upscale faucets and sinks — the firm's marketing describes its dedication to "gracious living" — than for focusing on basic sanitation for the world's poor.

But Kohler also is among the world's five largest manufacturers of plumbing products.

And when the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, considered one of the country's biggest and most generous foundations, announced its "Reinvent the Toilet Challenge" in 2011, Kohler took notice.

It's been a long time since the toilet changed much.

The modern flush toilet works in essentially the same way as the one invented in the late 1500s by Sir John Harington, an English author who installed one of his toilets for Queen Elizabeth I at her palace in Surrey.

And with advances in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the flush toilet has worked pretty well and has contributed greatly in reducing disease and prolonging life — when it's well-connected.

But it's not much help unless it feeds a system to treat the waste it swirls away.

In much of the world, that sort of infrastructure doesn't exist.

"That's very, very expensive," said Doulaye Kone, an environmental engineer who grew up in a village in Africa's Ivory Coast and now works at the Gates Foundation.

"It will work in very few (developing world) cities."

So the foundation called for off-the-grid designs without connections to water, sewer or electrical lines.

It issued grants to eight universities, including one to a California Institute of Technology (Caltech) team led by environmental science professor Michael Hoffmann.

The plan: Develop a self-contained toilet and waste treatment system powered by a solar panel generating enough energy to store, so the toilet can be used at night when there's no sun.

Kohler contacted Caltech and offered to supply fixtures for the first prototype model.

The Caltech toilet went on to win the Gates challenge in 2012.

Hoffmann and his students are preparing to fine-tune the prototype and get it ready for field testing in India, set to begin later this year.

So Kohler offered to provide Caltech with more parts, along with design support to create a toilet that is "culturally appropriate for the India market," Zimmerman said.

And that may lead to new markets for Kohler to sell its products.

The company at least is interested in the possibilities, Zimmerman said.

"We're going to find that out, but absolutely," he said.

The Caltech effort is just one of several the Gates Foundation is supporting.

Kohler competitor American Standard Brands, which has plunged more deeply and directly into the work than has Kohler, also received money from the foundation.

American Standard has taken a low-tech approach.

The company developed a plastic toilet pan that uses a mechanical trap door and water seal designed to close off pit latrines from the open air and prevent flies from entering.

Last year, American Standard donated more than 500,000 of the devices to organizations in Bangladesh, spokeswoman Nora DePalma said.

The firm now is working in Kenya on an effort, also supported by the Gates Foundation, to develop a similarly simple device for areas that lack abundant water, DePalma said.

American Standard has taken a cheaper approach, while the Caltech toilet is pricey.

Hoffmann estimates that initially it will take $1,500 to $2,000 to build.

The Caltech toilet — with its solar panel, electrochemical reactor and fuel cell battery — also has been criticized as being too complicated.

However, Hoffmann says it's a prototype built for research and can be simplified.

But Pete Kolsky, a water and sanitation expert and professor at the University of North Carolina, believes the "reinvent the toilet" idea needs to be put in the proper light.

The developing world's sanitation problems are immediate, and are far more organizational, motivational and social than they are technological, he said.

"If I were asked to advise on the investment of millions of dollars for sanitation in slum areas in India, you can rest assured I would recommend spending none of it pursuing this technology, and a lot more on 'looking at what can work locally, with what people already know how to do,'" he said.

At the same time, Kolsky said technological advances still should be pursued for potential future benefits.

Hoffmann, for his part, is convinced technology can help solve sanitation problems where other approaches, he said, have had little success.

"This can be done," he said.

"Fifty years ago, computers were too costly and complicated for the average person.

Today almost everyone carries a computer in their pocket."
