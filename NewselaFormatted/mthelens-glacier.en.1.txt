The site of the country's most deadly volcanic eruption in United States history has given birth to the world's newest glacier.

Ray Yurkewycz perched on the rim of Mount St. Helens, the Northwest's most restless volcano.

Rocks and boulders slid off the crater walls, kicking up plumes of dust as they clattered down the near-vertical slopes.

Steam rose from the twin domes formed after Mount St. Helens' eruption in 1980 and the quieter burst that started in 2004.

But Yurkewycz, operations director for the nonprofit Mount St. Helens Institute, was focused less on the volcano's fiery past than its icy present.

Few people realize that the hollowed-out crater where lava once flowed now holds the world's youngest glacier.

If that is not surprising enough, Crater Glacier is also growing at a time when most glaciers around the globe are shrinking.

"It's cascading down into this valley now," Yurkewycz said, pointing out a tongue of ice flowing over a rise and into a rocky ravine.

"It's only been in the last two years that it started doing that."

Yurkewycz led a small group of hikers to this ridge on the mountain's northeastern flank late last month to show a rare, close-up view of the glacier.

Even climbers on St. Helens' south rim sometimes cannot see into the crater because of overhanging snow.

A veteran mountaineer died in 2010 when a ledge collapsed and he fell 1,500 feet.

Not only are the rugged upper slopes treacherous, but the area serves as an open-air laboratory for scientists tracking the ecosystem's recovery.

The guided hike allows visitors to scramble off-trail to the lookout.

Mount St. Helens Institute debuted the outing three years ago and is expanding the schedule to nine dates this year, beginning in late July.

Critics object to the hike's $195 price tag and are pushing for greater access to the entire110,000-acre monument.

But scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) Cascades Volcano Observatory have been visiting the area since the early 1980s.

The scientists have documented the unique conditions that led to the glacier's formation and tracked its stunning growth.

"Nothing about this glacier is typical," USGS scientist Steve Schilling said.

Before 1980, Mount St. Helens was shaped like a cone and was draped with about a dozen small glaciers.

Most were destroyed during the eruption.

The mountain's north side collapsed, unleashing the biggest landslide ever recorded.

A blast vaporized everything for miles around and leveled 230 square miles of forest.

When the dust and ash settled, a horseshoe-shaped shell of a mountain was left, with a few remaining snow fields clinging to its flanks.

That shell provided a perfect nest to nurture a baby glacier.

It faces northward, which helps shield snow from the sun.

A thick layer of loose, volcanic rock on the crater floor provides an insulating barrier against volcanic heat rising from below.

When a lava dome began bulging upward, it formed a shelter along the crater's back wall where snow could pile up.

Normal snowfall alone cannot account for the glacier's formation, though, said USGS geologist Dave Sherrod.

An extra boost comes from the loads of snow and ice that fell into the crater off the rim and walls.

"It's as if you've doubled, tripled or quadrupled the amount of snow and ice accumulation in this small area," Sherrod said.

By 1988, a permanent snowfield more than 200 feet thick lay in the crater.

But things really got weird in 2004.

That's when the volcano sputtered back to life, intermittently spitting steam and oozing thick, pasty magma in an eruption that lasted for several years.

The lava quickly built a new dome more than 1,200 feet.

The USGS team feared the heat would melt the glacier and send water and mud tearing through the valleys below.

But the ice was so well insulated by its underlying rock layer that very little melted away.

Now, the glacier is creeping farther down the valley.

A steady stream of meltwater called Loowit Creek also springs from the base of the glacier, nourishing willow trees and flowers below.

The ice is now about 650 feet thick in places, Sherrod said.

Measured in a straight line, the glacier is 1.25 miles long.

The surface is so littered with volcanic rock that only a few glints of blue ice are visible.

In fact, Schilling estimates nearly a third of the glacier's mass is rock.

And just as the thick layer at its base provides insulation, so, too, does the layer on its surface.

"It's pretty exciting," Sherrod said.

"You can have rocks the size of a Volkswagen being hurled down at you."

Toxic gas occasionally wafts from the magma dome, and the interior of the glacier is full of caves.

A group of expert cave mappers got permission last year to explore those caverns for the first time.

They rappelled in through a funnel-shaped mouth they called the Godzilla Hole, said Jared Smith.

He is the lead guide for the Mount St. Helens Institute.

"It's probably 80 or 90 feet straight down," Smith said.

Inside, they found a steamy wonderland of sculpted ice and tunnels.

"It's just totally beautiful."
