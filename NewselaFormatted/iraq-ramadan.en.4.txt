From sunrise to sunset they fast.

They can't eat or drink the whole time.

At the end of the day, they break the fast.

Families get together for a huge dinner.

But an outbreak of violence in Iraq has made this year's Ramadan a difficult time.

At a refugee camp, police waved pots and pans to push back dozens of hungry Iraqis.

They are refugees who live in a camp for people left homeless by the fighting.

They were rushing to get food to end their first daylong fast of Ramadan.

Shouting men scrambled Sunday to reach pots of rice, meat and chicken stew in this dusty, hot refugee camp.

It sits near the northern city of Irbil.

The city is the capital of Iraq's Kurdish region.

Many Iraqis are fearful as they begin Ramadan.

The nation is having great troubles.

People are bitterly divided by their religious beliefs.

Sunnis and Shiites are the two largest Muslim groups in Iraq.

They are Arabs, but they practice two different types of Islam.

Most Iraqis are Shiites and the government is run by Shiites.

Sunni groups are fighting to change this.

They once ran the country.

Some are unhappy that Shiites are now in charge.

The Kurds are not Arab and have mostly avoided the conflict.

Their own region has some freedom from the Iraqi government.

Many Arab Iraqis have fled to the Kurdish region for safety.

Bashir Khalil, 39, is a Shiite and his wife Nidal is a Sunni.

For them, Ramadan has been robbed of its sense of community.

The couple fled Iraq's second-largest city of Mosul after it was captured by Sunni extremists earlier this month.

The family has always been poor.

But in their poor section of the city, neighbors shared food.

Here, when the food ended, there would be no more until another charity came by.

"When this food finishes, there'll be nothing else," 34-year-old Nidal Khalil sadly said.

She and her husband fled after being forcefully questioned by members of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS).

The group is made of Sunni fighters.

It was once part of the al-Qaida terrorist group.

Later it broke off.

In the last two weeks, ISIS has seized large parts of northern and western Iraq, including Mosul.

It is trying to set up a Sunni country in parts of Iraq and neighboring Syria.

ISIS doesn't consider Shiites to be true Muslims.

Bashir was questioned because he was a Shiite.

And Nidal was questioned because she worked as a cleaner in a Shiite charity.

They returned days later.

Local gunmen promised them that they wouldn't be harmed.

Yet, they came back to find their home had been damaged in clashes.

"We don't want this one or that one," said Nidal Khalil.

She was speaking of the Shiite-led government and the Sunni fighters.

"Neither of them cares about us poor people."

Her mother-in-law, Shamsa, sat nearby, smoking a cigarette.

Fasting Muslims are not supposed to smoke, eat or drink during daylight hours.

But the 70-year-old woman shrugged.

She said she couldn't fast in the heat.

A television station had donated the food on this day.

Bashir Khalil did not manage to get any of it.

However, his 10-year-old daughter, Sara, grabbed a bag filled with containers of soup, rice and meat.

At the camp's edge, it was quiet in tent D42.

There, another refugee named Umm Mishal watched the sun go down.

She sat alongside her youngest daughter Amal, who wore a torn red dress.

"Ramadan is a generous, blessed month.

We will not go hungry," the 49-year-old woman said.

Then she set out the family's dinner.

The donated food included soup, rice, a loaf of bread, a small roasted chicken and watermelon.

The evening's meal was taken care of.

Suddenly giddy, she exclaimed, "God has blessed us!"

She said with a giggle, "Eat some chicken!"
