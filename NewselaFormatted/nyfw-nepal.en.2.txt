They wander through museums and watch countless movies.

They flip through rare books and listen to unusual forms of music.

They love fictional characters who have totally impractical wardrobes.

The explanations for their clothing collections can be so complicated they are hard to understand.

Oftentimes, all those fancy ideas do not seem to do much for the clothes.

In New York City, it is Fashion Week.

Top clothing designers are showing off their spring 2016 collections in elaborate stage shows.

They are listing influences as varied as modern architect Frank Lloyd Wright and 1960s jazz singer Nina Simone.

However, some of the most beautiful clothes were produced by designers who simply drew on personal experience.

The clothes they presented reflect who they are and how they relate to the world around them.

Nepalese-American Prabal Gurung's collection was perhaps the most impressive.

Garung opened his Sunday night show with the solemn and soothing chants of a chorus of Buddhist monks.

As the audience waited in a large darkened room, the monks silently assembled.

With soft lights illuminating their orange-yellow robes, the low rumble of their voices moved gently across the room.

When the monks finished, they left silently.

Then, the show's music rumbled to life and the first models appeared.

They had on flowing dresses in shades of saffron, burnt orange and gold, a range of colors that echoed the robes the monk wore.

The collection reflected what has been a difficult year for Gurung.

The designer grew up in Nepal and felt the devastation of the 2015 earthquake there deeply.

As he wrote in his show notes, "Saturday, April 25, 2015 changed my life forever."

Gurung has family and friends in Nepal, and the images of the destruction there left him reeling.

He set out to raise money to help the victims.

So far, he has raised more than $613,000.

As Gurung worked to do what he could for Nepal, he also began to think back to his childhood there.

His mind began filling with memories of the sights, sounds and smells of Nepal.

Soon he decided to create a line of clothing that reflects those memories, as well as his country's deep history.

The result is a collection that is full of ease and beauty.

The clothes were graceful and flowing, and the embroidery was rich but not overwhelming.

Small differences in the thickness of the material created varying shades of color.

In some ways the show was Gurung's "thank you" to the fashion industry for supporting the people of Nepal — and him.

He offered his thanks by sharing a bit of what he holds dear.

Even though most in the audience knew little of Nepal, the collection was created with such personal feeling that it seemed both moving and familiar.

Gurung's was not the only collection to draw on roots in another country.

Designer Joseph Altuzarra turned to his background in the Basque region of France.

The results were beautiful.

The rich material Altuzarra used made his clothes seem luxurious.

Tiny white pearl buttons on a linen coat gave it the feeling of antiquity.

However, it was his colors that especially captured the imagination.

Shades of the sky on a shirt or of a sunset on a sweater almost seemed to bring back sweet childhood memories of picnics or days at the beach.

The ideas behind some other designers' collections were not as personal.

Still, the results were sometimes quite appealing.

Derek Lam's collection, for instance, successfully reflected his love for the music of Nina Simone.

His collection was a little bit old-fashioned, a little bit manly and a little bit girly.

The jackets looked sharp and the dresses were light and flowing.

Other designers, however, struggled to translate their ideas into striking clothing.

Designers Humberto Leon and Carol Lim, for example, were inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright.

They presented their collection in an elaborate set with lights inspired by the famous architect's work.

There were dancers, and a thick booklet with "further reading" about all the various elements of the show.

Some patterns and shapes did echo Wright's architecture.

Still, the connection between the presentation and the clothes was not always clear.

All in all, it was a fine collection but one that felt a bit overwhelmed by the ideas behind it.
