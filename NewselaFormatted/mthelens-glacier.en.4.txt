Mount St. Helens is a volcano.

It is in Washington state.

It came to life in 1980.

Lava started coming out of the volcano.

Then something else happened.

A glacier began to grow inside.

It is called Crater Glacier.

It is the newest in the world.

A glacier is a huge piece of ice.

Scientists are looking at how it formed.

The volcano blast destroyed one side.

It also wiped out everything for miles around.

The dust and ash settled.

Then the mountain was shaped like the letter U.

It was a perfect nest for a baby glacier.

Things were just right to make a glacier.

The mountain faces north.

That means it is cold.

Sun does not shine on the snow.

Rocks from the volcano are on the floor.

The rocks block heat from below.

A cone of rock lets snow pile up.

The snow will not melt.

Then the volcano woke up again.

In 2004, it started to spit steam.

It oozed lava for a few years.

Lava is hot melted rocks from the volcano.

Now the glacier is flowing down the mountain.

The ice is super thick, like big buildings, said Dave Sherrod.

He is a geologist.

Geologists are scientists.

They study rocks.

The glacier is just over 1 mile long.

The glacier is covered with rocks.

Just bits of blue ice can be seen.

Water is melting from the glacier.

It waters the flowers and trees below.

Inside the glacier are caves.

Hikers like to see the glacier up close.

Last year, cave mappers explored them for the first time.

They climbed in through a hole, said Jared Smith.

He is a mountain guide.

They went straight down.

It was a long way.

It was full of tunnels.

The cave looked like a wonderland.

It was very beautiful, Jared said.
