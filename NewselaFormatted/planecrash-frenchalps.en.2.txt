French officials fear that no one survived the crash.

It is a mystery why the Airbus A320 crashed mid-flight after a sudden eight-minute steep drop.

The pilots sent out no distress call and had lost radio contact with air traffic controllers before the crash, France's aviation authority said.

It crashed while flying from Barcelona, Spain, to Duesseldorf, Germany.

The crash left officials and families across Europe in a state of shock.

"The crash of the German plane with more than 140 people on board is a shock that plunges us in Germany, the French and the Spanish into deep sorrow," German Chancellor Angela Merkel said.

She is the head of the German government.

Merkel said that authorities do not know much beyond basic information about the flight.

She said it was still too soon to speculate why the plane crashed.

"All that will be investigated thoroughly," Merkel said.

She planned to travel Wednesday to the area where the plane crashed.

U.S. National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said there was no indication that terrorism was involved.

France's prime minister said a helicopter crew that landed briefly in the area saw no signs of life.

French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said a black box had been located at the crash site and "will be immediately investigated."

He did not say whether it was the flight data recorder or the cockpit voice recorder.

Germanwings, the airliner that operated the flight, said Flight 9525 carried 144 passengers and six crew members.

Officials believe 67 German residents were on board, including 16 high school students on a school exchange program.

Dutch officials said one Dutch citizen was killed.

The plane left Barcelona Airport at 10:01 a.m.

It began a rapid descent shortly after  reaching a cruising altitude of 38,000 feet, Germanwings CEO Thomas Winkelmann said.

The plane crashed at an altitude of about 2,000 meters (6,550 feet), at Meolans-Revels, near the popular ski resort of Pra Loup.

The site is 700 kilometers (430 miles) south-southeast of Paris.

"It was a deafening noise.

I thought it was an avalanche, although it sounded slightly different.

It was short noise and lasted just a few seconds," said Sandrine Boisse, the president of the Pra Loup tourism office.

Interior Ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet told French television that the mountainous area is very remote and hard to reach.

He expected "an extremely long and extremely difficult" search-and-rescue operation.

Weather in the area worsened Tuesday afternoon, and a chilly rain began to fall.

"No one can access the site from the ground," said Gilbert Sauvan, a lawmaker and president of the general council of Alpes-de-Haute-Provence.

Winkelmann said the pilot had more than 10 years of experience working for Germanwings and Lufthansa, Germany's biggest airline.

Germanwings is a lower-cost unit of Lufthansa and flies to mostly European cities.

The aircraft was delivered to Lufthansa in 1991 and had been flown 58,300 hours in about 46,700 flights, Airbus said.

On Monday, the plane was checked out in Germany, and it last underwent a regular full check in the summer of 2013.

Pierre Polizzi, who owns a nearby campground, heard the plane making strange noises shortly before it crashed.

"At 11:30, I heard a series of loud noises in the air.

There are often fighter jets flying over, so I thought it sounded just like that," he said.

"I looked outside, but I couldn't see any fighter planes," he said.

"The noise I heard was long, like eight seconds, as if the plane was going more slowly than a military plane.

There was another long noise after about 30 seconds."

Polizzi said the plane crashed about 5 to 8 kilometers (3 to 11 miles) from the campground.

"It's going to be very difficult to get there.

The mountain is snowy and very hostile," he said.

In Paris, French President Francois Hollande called the crash "a tragedy on our soil."

The A320 plane is a workhorse of modern aviation.

The single-aisle, twin-engine jet flies to cities between one and five hours apart.

The A320 is built to fly up to an altitude of 39,000 feet.

It can begin to experience problems as low as 37,000 feet, depending on temperature and weight, including fuel, cargo and passengers.

Worldwide, 3,606 A320s are in operation, according to Airbus.

The A320 family also has a good safety record, with just 0.14 fatal accidents per million takeoffs, according to Boeing.
