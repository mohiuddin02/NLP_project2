The nation's first transcontinental railroad line was completed in 1869.

For the first time, it became possible to travel from the East Coast to the West Coast by train.

It took thousands of men to build all those new tracks and tunnels.

Many of those workers came all the way from China to work on the huge project.

Once here, many were badly mistreated.

Now, Stanford University is helping to change that.

Scholars at the school have launched the Chinese Railroad Workers in North America Project.

Their goal is to put together as much information as possible about the experiences these migrants had in North America.

Very little is known of the 12,000 Chinese migrants who came here to build the railroad during the 1860s.

Many are listed in records only under nicknames like "China Sam" or "China Jim."

So far, no letters home or other writings by the men have been found.

Scholars believe that many of the men were were merchants and traders seeking opportunity in the United States.

Many were educated men.

"They were not just strong backs," said scholar Gordon Chang.

They had "different skills, including cooking, accounting, carpentry and masonry."

In early June, about 250 people came to Stanford University to talk about the migrants.

Descendants of about 50 railroad workers came from as far away as Hawaii.

They shared their family histories with scholars.

San Francisco filmmaker Barre Fong attended the June event.

He is working on a documentary movie about the migrants.

"Up to now, we kind of have this image of nameless, faceless men with big straw hats," said Fong.

"We got some pretty interesting details about who they were," he said.

Chin Lin Sou, for example, learned to speak English perfectly.

He went on to become a successful     businessman in Denver, Colorado.

Hung Lai Woh came over as a teenager and built sheds to protect the rail tracks from heavy snowfall.

He later ran a business in San Francisco, California.

Sandy Lee told scholars that her great-grandfather's work team was attacked by an American Indian tribe.

The tribe's chief had recently lost his son and took Lee's ancestor to live with him.

The young man was freed two years later.

He then went back to China, where he got married.

Then, he joined his brother in Maryland and took up farming.

Many Chinese who built the railroads were not eager to tell people about their experiences.

Filmmaker Fong himself had a great-grandparent who served as a cook on the railroad.

However, he rarely discussed it because he felt ashamed about those years.

"It was not a proud time in his life," Fong said.

"It was only mentioned in passing, never in detail."

However, many Chinese-Americans now feel differently, Chang said.

They now see what the migrants did as something to be honored.

"These workers were the ancestors of many Chinese-Americans today," Chang said.

More and more the migrants are seen as heroes.

Chinese railroad workers were treated very badly.

They received less pay than Irish workers and had to provide their own food and housing.

These days, Asians who move to the United States have a much easier time.

"With enough money you can buy a home anywhere you want, you can send your child to Stanford or UCLA, you can start a business anywhere.

But that was not the case even in my lifetime," said Fong, who is 48.

People who think things were always easy for Asians in the U.S. are badly mistaken, Fong said.

"The way was paved by several generations that really suffered and worked very hard," he said.

"I hope projects like this help the newly arrived see this."
