More than one-third of Americans are obese, or very overweight.

Being obese is dangerous for a person's health.

It can lead to serious diseases.

The government has made laws that try to help.

Fast-food restaurants now have to post calories for the foods they serve.

Calories are units used to measure energy in food.

Eating too many calories can make people gain weight.

The government thought that knowing how many calories were in foods would lead people to make better food choices.

It also hoped that showing calories on menus would make restaurants want to sell healthier foods.

A new study shows that they were half right.

Restaurant customers may not make healthier choices based on being told how many calories, for example, are in a cheeseburger.

Yet it may push restaurants into serving healthier foods.

The study was done by scientists from three universities.

They found that when eateries had to show the calories in foods they serve, they started selling lower-calorie meals.

When there are better food choices, some diners will choose them.

Restaurants that posted calories actually reduced the number of calories in foods.

They cut the calories in foods that they already sold by an average of 120 calories.

New dishes that were added averaged 146 fewer calories.

Two years after calorie information first appeared, only one-quarter of customers used it to decide what to eat.

Many customers said they did not even notice the information was there.

Having to post calories has made many restaurants change.

Places like Starbucks and McDonald's have cut calories and fat in some of the foods they serve.

They also offer more low-calorie foods.

For example, the Cheesecake Factory changed some of its dishes to make them healthier.

They also added "SkinnyLicious" meals that are only around 600 calories.

A new law will start in December 2016.

It says that more places, like movie theaters, snack shops and ice cream parlors, will also have to list calories for foods they sell.

Every day, about one-third of all Americans eat out.

Cutting the calories in those foods outside the home could make a real difference, the study said.
