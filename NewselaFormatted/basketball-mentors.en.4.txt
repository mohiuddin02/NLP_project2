Basketball is helping some sixth-grade boys behave better.

The boys love basketball.

A program in Akron, Ohio, uses this love.

The basketball program helps the boys become better men.

The idea is to teach the boys to show more respect.

They also gain respect from others.  There are 76 students in the program.

They come from seven elementary schools.

School officials think focusing on boys in middle school is a good idea.

It is an important age for boys.

Their bodies are changing.

Their feelings are changing, too.

More boys get in trouble at this age.

The basketball program costs less than $10,000 to run.

Akron school official Dan Rambler said it is paying off.

Students meet once a week after school.

They spend 15 minutes on the basketball court.

Then they spend another 105 minutes in a classroom.

They help each other with homework.

The mentors are adults who can give advice on life and talk with the students.  The seven teams play each Saturday. A student cannot play if he gets into trouble.

Students also have to finish their schoolwork if they want to play.  The boys in the program are behaving.

They are also doing better in reading and math, school officials said.

Kyle Earley decides who can play.

Kyle makes the kids do tough drills and exercises for bad behavior.

Kyle works with young people at a church.

He graduated from an Akron high school in 1998.

Then he coached middle school basketball.

Kyle was a mentor.

He saw students skipping school.

They also got into trouble.

So he suggested the idea of a sixth-grade basketball league.

Kyle got his sister involved.

Her name is Ciara Dennis.

She is a psychologist.

She helps people with how they think and feel.

Ciara came up with a plan.

It helps the mentors teach the boys to be responsible for their actions.

The boys learn to use their anger in a good way.

They also learn to understand and respect others.

They learn to be proud of who they are.
