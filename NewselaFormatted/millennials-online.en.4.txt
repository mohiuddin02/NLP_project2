All around us, things are happening in the world.

The news tells us what is happening.

People get news in different ways.

Maybe you watch TV or use a computer.

Perhaps you ask your parents.

A new study wanted to find out how people between the ages of 18 and 34 get their news.

These people are called millennials.

The study asked millennials how they use technology to get their news.

Computers and cellphones are types of technology.

The study found that black, white and Hispanic millennials get plenty of news.

Two out of every three millennials say they often read and watch news online.

Some people used to worry about this.

They worried that people of color would not have the same chance to use technology.

The study found that they were wrong.

Millennials like to use Facebook.

Some even get their news on Facebook.

African-Americans and Hispanics use some types of technology the most.

They like to use smartphones.

Nearly all millennials use smartphones.

Half of them use a tablet such as an iPad.

African-Americans are also more likely to use Facebook to keep up with "trending" stories.

Trending stories are ones that many people are talking about.

The study said the biggest thing African-American millennials do online is streaming music, TV or movies online.

Hispanic millennials like keeping up with their friends.

White millennials like sending email.

Tom Rosenstiel was in charge of the study.

"Millennials' similarities are much greater than the differences people thought that there were going to be," he said.

"We've created new common ground."

The study used a survey of 1,045 young adults.

They answered a list of questions.

The survey took place from Jan. 5 through Feb. 2, 2015.

The survey was conducted using online interviews in English and Spanish.

All the adults were age 18-34.
