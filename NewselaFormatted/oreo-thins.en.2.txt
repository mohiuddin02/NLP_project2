There is a new twist to the Oreo cookie.

Mondelez International, the makers of Oreos, just introduced Oreo Thins.

They are slightly wider and just a little over half as thick as the original version of the best-selling cookies in the world.

Oreo Thins are not a diet version of regular Oreos.

These sleek new cookies are designed to be a sophisticated and grown-up take on the classic.

Shoppers are meant to eat them the way they come instead of twisting them apart to lick the creamy filling.

These slimmed-down Oreos are faced with a big challenge: extending the empire of the most widely eaten cookie in history.

Oreo's incredible success puts them in a league of their own.

Nearly $1 out of every $5 spent on cookies in the United States is used to buy Oreos.

Their closest competitor, Keebler, is in a very distant second place.

Last year, Americans spent about twice as much on Oreos as they did on all of Keebler's 11 varieties added together.

This year, the Oreo brand sold more than 1 1/2 times as many cookies as it did just 10 years ago.

That is the largest jump for any of the top cookie brands sold in the United States.

Total cookie sales for all brands added together have gone up by about one-tenth, but most of that growth was due to higher demand for Oreos.

Of course, Americans are not the only ones who love Oreos.

The chocolate-and-creme sandwich cookies rule the global cookie market, too.

About 5 of every 100 cookies sold worldwide are Oreos.

That might not sound like much, but Oreo's slice of the pie is more than three times bigger than that of any other brand.

There are many reasons Oreos have become such a powerful product.

For one thing, people really like them.

Oreos that do not get gobbled up on their own or dipped into milk can be used to make other foods better.

They might be mixed with ice cream, blended into milkshakes, pounded into pie crust or crumbled up and used as a topping.

Sometimes they are even deep-fried.

People have also gotten used to the Oreo brand, which was introduced by Nabisco in 1912.

Cookie fans are drawn to its unique shape and familiar twisting and dunking experience.

Even though Oreos have a strong tradition, mixing things up has helped the variety to grow.

Over the years, the company has tried out lots of new Oreo flavors.

This has helped them reach out to new customers and keep loyal fans interested.

Some of the new recipes have become very popular.

Golden Oreos, which have vanilla cookies instead of chocolate, sold so well that the company decided to keep making them.

Wild flavors like Watermelon Oreos are more likely to be sold seasonally.

Even if the crazy versions are not big hits, they can still give the brand a boost.

Plus, they might remind Oreo-lovers that it has been too long since the last time they bought a pack of the originals.

Oreo Thins will soon hit store shelves in the United States.

They were successful in China, where they were introduced last year.

Mondelez International plans to eventually sell them worldwide.
