Dakar is the capital of Senegal.

The country is in Africa.

Dakar used to be a quiet city.

Now there is much going on.

Big buildings are going up across the city.

People are eating in restaurants.

They are shopping in stores.

Everyone seems to own a cellphone.

Some people even own two.

Africa is still a poor continent.

Countries are at war.

Yet, there are many big changes.

The new changes give people hope.

The future of Africa is looking better.

The Pew Research Center gives people information about the world.

Not long ago, it did a study.

It found that many Africans felt better about their future.

They felt their countries are getting richer.

Amadou Sy is an expert on Africa.

He said the study was right.

Many African countries are becoming richer.

There are still many poor people, though.

Almost half of the people in sub-Saharan Africa live on less than $1.25 a day.

Sub-Saharan Africa is the area south of the Sahara Desert.

Experts also see signs of trouble.

Africa sells oil.

Prices for oil used to be high.

High prices are good for Africa.

Now these prices are dropping.

African countries will make less money.

The study found many interesting facts.

More than half of Africans think their countries will become richer next year.

They are more hopeful than people in other parts of the world.

Just one out of three people in the United States are hopeful.

Many Africans felt good about their children's future.

More than half said children today will be richer than their parents.

They also saw serious problems.

There are not enough jobs.

Health care and schools are bad.

Most people thought their governments will fix these problems.

They also had complaints.

Too many government officials are not honest.

Dishonesty is a big problem in Africa.
