One December morning, Tony Castillo noticed something new as he skateboarded down Fairfax Avenue like he had for more than two years.

A bright red sign with white text stared him in the face, clasped to the streetlight pole in front of the sneaker store Flight Club.

It had the look of a standard street sign, but it offered no instructions on parking, driving or walking.

Instead, it displayed words to a rap song talking about the very spot Castillo had just blown past.

He set his fingers to work twisting off the nuts and pushing hard on the braces to pop out the bolts.

After about 15 minutes, Castillo held one of his most treasured pieces of street art.

"I can see the energy the artist put into it," he said.

"This is some really thoughtful stuff."

Artist Jason Shelowitz installed 45 of the 46 signs he had designed for Los Angeles County in December.

Shelowitz, also known as Jay Shells, believes all have since then disappeared.

The Times searched for 19 and found only fragments of one.

A spokesman for the city of Los Angeles said it is against the law to post signs on public property without a permit.

But the city has no record of removing any of the signs.

Some signs have been taken by street-art enthusiasts like Castillo.

At least one quoted artist took his sign for himself.

Rappers including Murs, Action Bronson and Lupe Fiasco have given big ups to the project via social media, sometimes posting pictures of their signs on Instagram, Facebook or Twitter.

Shelowitz said he plans to return to Los Angeles later this month to put up six new signs around town.

Gallery 1988 on Melrose Avenue plans to exhibit limited edition signs and photos of signs starting in April.

"I was thinking (the signs) would be a hidden gift for people who pay attention to their surroundings," Shelowitz said.

"I wanted it to be something where if you happened to see it, you'd be like, 'That's ...

awesome!'

— and just take a minute."

Growing up in the suburbs of New York, Shelowitz was surrounded by music.

He and his friends drove into the city to see live hip-hop.

As they got older, some became DJs and producers.

Years later, in his home studio on the Upper East Side, Big L's track "Lifestylez Ov Da Poor &amp; Dangerous" started playing one day.

The song warns against late-night trips to a park at the corner of West 139th Street and Lenox Avenue in New York.

Shelowitz contemplated the lyric, and the seed for the project took root.

"I think I just realized at that moment — I had never been there," he said.

And when he arrived, "I just thought it would be so cool to mark that corner with the lyric."

Soon he was sending mass emails and requests on social media asking for any rap lyric that mentioned a location.

After the suggestions rolled in, he put up more than 50 signs in New York.

Months later, he carted 46 signs to Los Angeles during a holiday visit.

Shelowitz took to Twitter in late December to send out pictures of each sign's location, weeks after he put them up.

But by then, the treasure hunt had already begun, and most of the signs were gone.

Anwar Carrots, 23, took it upon himself to steal his own sign.

Carrots showed up at a friend's listening party at Diamond Supply Co. several weeks ago.

He was immediately greeted by chatter about his sign.

"What quote?"

he wondered, so a friend took him a few steps outside.

There he saw words he had rapped at age 17 "just for fun" with his friend Casey Veggies.

"I kind of freaked out," said Carrots, who helps run a clothing and management company.

"I'm not a rapper ... the lyrics are off (and) I had seen those quotes when I go to New York sometimes, so I was like, 'This is legendary.'"
