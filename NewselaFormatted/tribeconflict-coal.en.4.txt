The Crow and the Lummi are two Native American tribes.

They live in different states.

The two groups are stuck in a big fight.

The Crow live in Montana.

They have much grassy land.

It is full of coal.

The Crow plan to dig up the coal.

They want to sell it.

People burn coal to make electricity.

People in Asia want to buy the coal from the Crow land.

The Crow need a way to get it over to them.

Asia is on the other side of the Pacific Ocean.

The Crow want to use trains and boats.

Trains will carry the coal to Washington state.

Then workers will put it on boats.

Boats will take the coal to Asia.

The Lummi do not like this idea at all.

They say the Crow will need to build a new station for the coal.

It would be built on top of a Lummi graveyard.

The Lummi believe it is not respectful to do so.

Lummi leaders are worried about fishing, too.

They say the new station would hurt the place where they fish.

The Lummi need to eat the fish they catch.

They need to sell them, too.

Now the Lummi are talking to other tribes.

They are asking for help.

The Lummi want to stop the Crow.

They do not want them to build the coal mine or the new station.

The Crow say they need the new mine.

They are running out of money.

Many people in the Crow tribe need to find work.

Crow leaders say the mine will give people jobs.

It will help them for many years to come.

Darrin Old Coyote is the leader of the Crow.

He went to visit the Lummi.

Old Coyote went fishing with their leader.

He invited them to visit the Crow tribe.

The Lummi would not come to Montana.

Old Coyote was sad.

"They don't want to understand where we're coming from," he said.
