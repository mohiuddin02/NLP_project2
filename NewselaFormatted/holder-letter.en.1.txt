_Eric H. Holder is attorney general of the United States, appointed by President Barack Obama.

As attorney general, Holder heads the U.S. Department of Justice, which is responsible for ensuring that justice is carried out in a fair and unbiased manner, among other duties.

The following is a letter by Holder written for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, adapted by Newsela.

_ Since the Aug. 9 shooting death of Michael Brown by a police officer, the nation and the world have witnessed the unrest that has gripped Ferguson, Missouri.

At the core of these demonstrations is a demand for answers about how this young man died and a larger concern about the state of our criminal justice system.

At a time when so much may seem uncertain, the people of Ferguson can have confidence that the Justice Department intends to learn exactly what happened.

A fair and thorough investigation will be held.

On Wednesday, I was in Ferguson to receive an update on the federal civil rights investigation that I launched more than one week ago.

I met personally with community leaders, FBI investigators and federal prosecutors from the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorney's Office.

They briefed me on details of the case.

The full resources of the Department of Justice have been committed to the investigation into Michael Brown's death.

This inquiry will take time to complete, but we have already taken significant steps.

Approximately 40 FBI agents and some of the Civil Rights Division's most experienced attorneys have been deployed to lead this process, with the assistance of the United States Attorney in St. Louis.

Hundreds of people have already been interviewed in connection with this matter.

On Monday, at my direction, a team of federal medical examiners conducted their own autopsy of Brown's body.

We understand the need for an independent investigation, free from the involvement of local law enforcement in Ferguson.

We hope that the independence and thoroughness of our investigation will bring some measure of calm to the tensions in Ferguson.

In order to begin the healing process, however, we must first see an end to the acts of violence in the streets of Ferguson.

Although these acts have been committed by a very small minority — and, in many cases, by individuals from outside Ferguson — they hurt, rather than help, the cause of justice.

And they interrupt the deeper conversation that the peaceful demonstrators are trying to advance.

The Justice Department will defend the right of protesters to peacefully demonstrate and for the media to cover a story that must be told.

But violence cannot be allowed.

I urge the citizens of Ferguson who have been peacefully exercising their First Amendment rights to join with law enforcement in condemning the actions of looters, vandals and others seeking to inflame tensions and create conflict.

Law enforcement has a role to play in reducing tensions, as well.

As the brother of a retired law enforcement officer, I know firsthand that our men and women in uniform perform their duties in the face of tremendous threats and significant personal risk.

They put their lives on the line every day, and they often have to make split-second decisions.

At the same time, good law enforcement requires forging bonds of trust between the police and the public.

This trust is all-important, but it is also fragile.

It requires that force be used in appropriate ways.

Enforcement and arrest patterns must not lead to treating groups of people differently under the law, even if such treatment is unintended.

And police forces should be made up of officers who reflect the different groups and races in the communities they serve.

Over the years, we have made significant progress in ensuring that this is the case.

But much more needs to be done.

Conversations should continue — but they must also be converted into concrete action.

And it is painfully clear, across our great nation, that more progress, more conversation, and more action are needed.

This is my pledge to the people of Ferguson: Our investigation into this matter will be full, it will be fair, and it will not be influenced by anyone.

And beyond the investigation itself, we will work with the police, civil rights leaders, and members of the public to ensure that this tragedy can give rise to new understanding — and strong action — aimed at bridging the gaps between law enforcement officials and the communities we serve.

Long after the events of Aug. 9 are gone from the headlines, the Justice Department will continue to stand with this community.

As we move forward together, I ask for the public's cooperation and patience.

And I urge anyone with information related to the shooting to contact the FBI by dialing 800-CALL-FBI, option 4.
