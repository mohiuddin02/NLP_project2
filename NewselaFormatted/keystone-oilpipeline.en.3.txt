President Barack Obama announced Friday that he will not allow the Keystone XL oil pipeline to be built.

The pipeline would have brought Canadian oil into the United States.

It would have stretched from northern Canada all the way to the southern United States and the Gulf of Mexico.

Since it would cross the U.S. border, the president has the power to stop it.

Tar sand oil is oil that is trapped in sand.

For it to be removed, the sand has to be heated enough for the oil to melt out.

Many people say doing that is bad for the air and water.

It can hurt animals and people too, they claim.

Many people also believe the United States should be using less oil, not looking for more of it.

Scientists say the world is getting hotter.

The steady rise in temperature is known as global warming or climate change.

Scientists say global warming is causing very serious problems, such as droughts, fires and rising sea levels.

They believe oil is the biggest cause of global warming.

When oil is burned, it releases gases, which stay in the air and trap heat.

Obama said the Keystone pipeline would not be good for the United States.

He said he did not believe it would lead to as many new jobs as some people say it would.

The pipeline was first thought up almost 10 years ago.

If built, it would carry more than 800,000 barrels of oil a day from Canada to the United States.

Those against it warned that mining for tar sands oil is dangerous.

It is harmful to wildlife and people, they said.

Meanwhile, supporters said the pipeline would bring a lot of new jobs.

A lot of people would be hired to build it, they said.

However, a government study found that most of the new jobs would not last long.

Once the pipeline was built, only 35 workers would still be needed to keep it running.

On the other hand, Obama said he does not think the pipeline would have been all that dangerous.

It would not have caused as much damage as some people were afraid it would, he said.

Still, Obama said it was important to stop the pipeline from being built.

Stopping it shows that the U.S. is serious about fighting global warming.

Obama said the United States should set a good example.

World leaders need to get serious about fighting climate change, he said.

Some oil will just have to just stay in the ground unused.

Many people were happy with the president's decision.

Leaders of the fight against the pipeline said people banding together helped stop the project and might have changed the president's mind.

They promised to fight other projects they believe are harmful to the planet.

The "power of the American people" beat the big oil companies, said Tom Steyer.

He is a billionaire from California.

Steyer has given tens of millions of dollars to the fight to stop climate change.

The pipeline once seemed like a sure thing, he said.

Then people who refused to accept it came together and managed to stop it.

Pipeline backers said President Obama has made a big mistake.

Obama's decision proves he is not looking out for the ordinary working man, labor leader Terry O'Sullivan claimed.

He represents the type of workers who might have built the Keystone.

The pipeline would have created many badly needed jobs, he said.

Congressman Kevin McCarthy said the president's decision shows he is not a strong enough leader.

Obama is not able to handle tough problems, he said.

McCarthy is a Republican, while Obama is a Democrat.

The two groups run against each other in elections.

Both groups hope to control the country.
