Michael J. Zogry teaches at a college.

Not long ago he found a recording.

He listened to it.

He heard the voice of James Naismith.

James was talking on the recording.

He was talking about how he made up the sport of basketball 124 years ago.

James died 76 years ago.

Michael got it from the Library of Congress.

It is the biggest library in the world. The recording was from an old radio show.

It was made in 1939.

James told how he set up the game.

James was a gym teacher.

He taught at a school in Massachusetts. There was a bad snow storm.

His students were stuck inside.

He had to make up a new indoor game for his students.

They were restless.  James said he tried everything to keep the students quiet.

First, the kids played indoor football.

They soon got bored.

James had an idea.

He got an old soccer ball.

He made two teams of nine players each.

He described the game to his students.

Each team had a peach basket. They would try and throw the ball into the other team's basket.

He blew a whistle.

The first game of basketball began.

It did not go well.

There were 18 players.

They tackled each other.

Two young men got black eyes.  James did not make up enough rules.

That was a big mistake.

Many players got hurt.

But they liked the game.

The players begged James to make better rules.

Then the game would be safer.

They would not get hurt.

James quickly made more rules.

He invented 13 rules of the game.  James has a grandson.

His name is Jim.

He had never heard his grandfather's voice.

Then he listened to the recording.

It helped him get to know his grandfather.

The recording helped people learn how James created the rules of basketball.  Michael was surprised to find the recording.

He was excited to share it.

Now people could hear James' voice.

They could hear him talk about how basketball was invented.  James worked at a university in Kansas for 40 years.

Now Michael works there. James was the first basketball coach at the school.

His 13 rules will be on display at the school.

Everyone can see them.
