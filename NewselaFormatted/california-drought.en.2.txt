After a bit of calculating, they realized they only had enough water to last 100 days.

It was time to adopt the toughest rationing measures they could.

The 5,000 residents of this former lumber town in Mendocino County are now on a crash water diet.

A family of four is rationed to no more than 150 gallons a day.

Outdoor watering, car washing and hosing down the pavement are banned.

Businesses have been ordered to cut water usage by 35 percent.

"The more we looked at the data, the more we realized the situation is bleak," Willits City Manager Adrienne Moore said.

California was already parched from last year's dry weather.

Now as the winter progresses, concern is mounting that California may be headed for a replay of the big drought of the late 1980s through the early 1990s.

Or, even worse, the drought of 1977.

The rainy season is only about half over, so rain and snow could still come.

But if monotonously sunny weather continues to curse the state, the pain of water shortages will spread, albeit unevenly.

"A lot of the smaller systems are going to be really hurting because they really don't have a lot of carry-over" of supplies from one year to the next, said Maury Roos, the state's chief water supply expert.

Water managers in Southern California, on the other hand, say they have enough reserves to get the state's most heavily populated region through the year without rationing.

San Francisco's water stores are also in decent shape.

The huge Imperial Irrigation District in Imperial County is also in good shape.

One of the nation's major sources of winter lettuce and vegetables, it will get its regular Colorado River irrigation deliveries this year.

And many growers on the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers won't suffer more than a 25 percent cut.

The story will be different for many San Joaquin Valley growers, particularly on the valley's south and west sides.

And also for ranchers and communities that depend on local surface supplies.

"I shudder to think if rain doesn't come," said Carre Brown, a supervisor in Mendocino County, which last week declared a drought emergency.

"All our reservoirs are very, very low."

Willits officials are looking into developing alternative water supplies.

For example, Moore said, a portable treatment system could be used to purify well water.

And the town may also drill new wells or tap a local recreational lake.

Residents significantly cut water use even before the rationing went into effect.

"This is an area where people are good at conservation, so they're geared for that," Moore said.

But there's one local industry that could be a problem.

"Quite honestly, the elephant in the room in several different ways in this matter is the marijuana industry," she said.

"They are heavy water users."

If pot growers don't cut back, they will be getting a knock on the door from local enforcement officers, who "will address the situation," she added.

Although 2013 was California's driest year in 119 years of records, from the point of view of water supply, the state is just now tipping into drought.

Gov.

Jerry Brown on Friday officially declared that California is in a drought emergency.

He called it an "unprecedented," or never-before-seen, situation.

Storage in most major reservoirs is well below average for the date and dropping when it should be rising.

But several reservoirs, including Shasta and Lake Oroville, the state's two biggest, had less water in them in January of 2009 and 1991.

"We're pretty low but there were worse" years, Roos said.

There's always a chance the weather could change.

And the stubborn, storm-blocking high pressure ridge parked off the West Coast could finally go away.

In early 2009, the state echoed with doom-laden drought warnings.

Then a series of February storms arrived.

And many remember the "Miracle March" of 1991 which brought triple the month's normal precipitation.

Some of the grimmest measurements this year are from Folsom Lake on the American River northeast of Sacramento.

The reservoir is only 18 percent full, a near record low that has gotten the attention of places not known for their thrifty water ways.

"Folsom Lake — it's pretty obvious there's a problem," said Shauna Lorance, general manager of the San Juan Water District.

Her system delivers Folsom water to Sacramento suburbs.

The area is known for big landscaped lots and irrigated horse pastures drive the district's per capita water use to about 369 gallons a day.

That is three times the rate in Los Angeles.

The district has asked customers to stop all outdoor watering.

If it remains dry, Lorance said, that request probably would turn into an order.

In nearby Sacramento, which draws some supplies from the American River, the City Council on Tuesday approved required rationing.

"We're not going to have Gestapo-type tactics here, but we're asking all water users to reduce their usage by 20 percent," City Manager John Shirey said.

"For an average residential customer, we think that's entirely attainable."

Situated on two rivers, California's capital city has traditionally been something of a water hog, especially during its scorching summers.

Still, water use has dropped in recent years.

Shirey said rainless seasons like this will further drive home the need to conserve — all the time.

"With [climate change](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming) occurring we have to assume that we could see long-term shortages of water in California, " he said.

"We just have to change, I think, the mindset here and everywhere — we're going to have less water to rely on."
