In 1492, Christopher Columbus left Spain.

Columbus was an explorer.

He wanted to go to Asia.

He found America instead.

He traveled with three ships.

But only two ships made it home.

One ship crashed into a reef.

This ship was named La Santa Maria.

The ship sank the next day.

Columbus and his men sailed the other two ships back to Spain.

Columbus wrote about the shipwreck in his journal.

His journal is now a treasure map for explorers.

Barry Clifford is an explorer.

He said he found the shipwreck of La Santa Maria near Haiti.

Haiti is an island in the Caribbean Sea.

"It was where Christopher Columbus said it would be," Barry said.

If Barry is right, he solved a mystery.

Barry found La Santa Maria because of a photo.

Years ago, Barry explored a shipwreck.

He took photos.

In one photo, he saw a very old cannon.

This type of cannon is called a lombard.

"There are only seven lombards that have been found," Clifford said.

"We found the eighth."

The cannon made Barry think the shipwreck was La Santa Maria.

No one knows yet if Barry is right.

Some people do not think Barry found La Santa Maria.

One of these people is another explorer.

His name is Daniel Koski-Karell.

Daniel also thought he found La Santa Maria.

But he was wrong.

Many ships sank near Haiti, Daniel said.

He said Columbus would not have left that cannon behind.

Columbus would have put it on another ship.

Barry will not say where the shipwreck is.

This summer, scientists will explore the ship.

They will run tests on it.

The tests will see how old the ship is.

If the ship is 500 years old, it may be La Santa Maria.
