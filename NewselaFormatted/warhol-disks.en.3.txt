The possibility of the new art has excited Warhol fans around the world.

The 28 images were probably created by Warhol on computer disks nearly 30 years ago.

The disks, however, were nearly unreadable.

That's where a group of Carnegie Mellon University students came in.

The students discovered how to get Warhol's pictures from the old disks into a modern computer.

It will take more research and debate before their historic value is clear.

But the high amount of interest is understandable for one of the world's most productive and studied artists.

"It's something that's new," said Matt Wrbican, who works at the Andy Warhol Museum and is an expert on Warhol.

"And that doesn't happen very often with Warhol."

The whole story was revealed Thursday morning.

The Andy Warhol Museum, Carnegie Mellon University and the Carnegie Museum of Art all had a hand in the discovery.

Warhol predicted  that "everyone would be world-famous for 15 minutes."

He died in 1987 in New York City.

He is still famous.

His paintings now cost more than $100 million at auctions.

The museum knew it had Warhol's Amiga computer and floppy disks for some time, Wrbican said.

Floppy disks were computer storage devices that stored information.

They have been replaced by CDs.

Wrbican said he had wanted to look through Warhol's computer and disks for a while, but couldn't find the time.

It took a modern, multimedia artist — and  Warhol fanatic — to finally get the ball rolling.

In 2011, New York City artist Cory Arcangel was doing a show at the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh.

He was asked if he had any ideas for any Pittsburgh-focused work.

The video shows Warhol "painting" rock singer Debbie Harry on an Amiga computer.

The Amiga was the first advanced multimedia art graphics computer.

Arcangel then called a friend to see if he knew anyone with expertise with old computers.

It turns out that the university had an active and energetic Computer Club.

The club has long been interested in old computer technology and how it developed.

Club members didn't think much of their chances when they saw the disks, said CMU graduate Keith Bare.

The disks had the computer's operating system on them, not personal information.

They weren't "disks with something handwritten on them like 'Andy Warhol's images' on them," he said.

It turned out the disks and the computer were early versions.

That made getting at the information on them more difficult.

The students created their own program.

They also used a program called a KryoFlux to allow a modern computer to read the floppy disk.

Combing the two, the team managed to pull the images from the disk and save them.

The images included Warhol's version of "The Birth of Venus" by 15th century artist Sandro Botticelli, a Warhol self-portrait, and a Campbell's soup can.

Warhol was known for drawing and painting soup cans.

Within hours of the discovery, Wrbican heard from someone who didn't think Warhol created the images.

It was a man who worked with the now-closed Amiga World magazine.

He said he didn't think Warhol made a lot of those images.

The magazine published a story in 1986 about Warhol and his Amiga computer.

But even if Warhol didn't make them by himself, they would be helpful in understanding Warhol's artwork, Wrbican said.

A lot of Warhol's art was created with other people, Wrbican said.

But even if Warhol had created the images all by himself, Wrbican noted, "I want to emphasize we're not calling these artwork.

It was just Warhol learning a new tool."

People might think the museum could sell the Warhol images for a lot of money.

But even if Warhol did create them, it won't be so easy to make money from them.

Warhol often used popular images or products.

like the Campbell's soup cans, in his work.

Other people or companies may own the rights to the images.

That means they can't be used without permission.

"We don't really see them as Warhol's artwork," Wrbican said.

"So I don't think we're going to be putting them out there on coffee cups to sell anytime soon."
