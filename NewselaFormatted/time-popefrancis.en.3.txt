The newsmagazine said the Roman Catholic Church's new leader has really changed how people see the church in just a short time.

The magazine has been naming a Person of the Year each year since 1927.

The [pope](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=pope) beat out National Security Association leaker Edward Snowden for the honor.

Snowden sent out information on the United States' secret spying program.

Pope Francis used to be an Argentine Cardinal named Jorge Mario Bergoglio.

He was elected in March as the first pope from Latin America.

He was also the first Jesuit to be elected pope.

Jesuits are a group of priests in the Catholic Church.

They are often involved in education and social causes.

He took the name Francis in honor of Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of the poor.

The pope has urged the Catholic Church not to be focused on "small-minded rules."

He has said the church should emphasize compassion when dealing with touchy topics like gay marriage.

He has condemned the world's worship of money.

He also says it is an embarrassment that nearly 1 billion people today go hungry.

Pope Francis also has charmed the masses with his simple style and wry sense of humor.

Tens of thousands of people come out to see him.

He also has more than 10 million followers on his Twitter account.

The Catholic Church is one of the world's largest organizations.

The pope has changed the way the church acts and how people see the church in a short time,  said Nancy Gibbs, Time's managing editor.

That made him stand out, she said.

The Vatican, the Roman Catholic Church's headquarters, said the honor wasn't surprising.

It pointed out the impact that Francis has had with the general public.

"The Holy Father is not looking to become famous or to receive honors," said the Vatican spokesman, the Rev.

Federico Lombardi.

"But if the choice of Person of Year helps spread the message of the Gospel — a message of God's love for everyone — he will certainly be happy about that."

It was the third time a Catholic pope had been Time's selection.

John Paul II was selected in 1994.

John XXIII was chosen in 1962.

Padre Toto is one of the many poor-people's priests in Argentina the pope supported for years when he was archbishop of Buenos Aires.

Toto praised Time's choice.

"Hopefully his way of being will catch on with other political leaders, business executives, sports figures.

His leadership is inspiring," Toto said of the pope.

President Barack Obama was Time's selection for 2012.
