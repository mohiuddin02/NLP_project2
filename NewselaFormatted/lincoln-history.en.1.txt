Abraham Lincoln was shot by assassin John Wilkes Booth 150 years ago on April 14.

Since then, views of his presidency have shifted and evolved over time.

As recent scholarship and events have shown, some of the issues behind the Civil War and Lincoln's struggle to abolish slavery are still with us.

They play a part in difficulties that continue in today's struggles over equality and race.

As the anniversary of his death approached, historians and moviemakers took a fresh look at Lincoln's words and actions, and at his unique relationship with black Americans.

Many of the problems Lincoln grappled with remain as troubling today as they were in his time.

Recent events in Ferguson, Missouri, and in North Charleston, South Carolina, where white police officers shot black men to death, demonstrated that the country is still plagued by the same racial divisions that Lincoln confronted in 1865.

Ceremonies commemorating the assassination's anniversary are planned at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield, Illinois, and at Ford's Theater and the Lincoln Memorial in Washington.

The election of Barack Obama, another son of Illinois, who frequently quoted Lincoln in his 2008 campaign, was supposed to mark a move into post-racial politics.

However, many of the same issues that confronted Lincoln have been revisited during Obama's presidency.

"All generations rethink Lincoln," historian Martha Hodes said.

"For this generation, it's about rethinking the meaning of freedom in a moment that is decidedly not the post-racial moment some expected with the election and re-election of the nation's first black president."

Memories of Lincoln are linked to painful current events and to "renewed calls for justice," Hodes said.

Other historians agree, pointing to ongoing political fights over voting rights.

In certain states, some feel that laws reduce the number of blacks who qualify to vote.

Lincoln was not murdered because he freed the slaves, historian Michael Burlingame said.

He was killed "because on April 11, 1865, he publicly called for black voting rights."

Booth, who was in the audience for that speech, vowed then to kill Lincoln, Burlingame said.

"It seems to me appropriate that we consider Lincoln as much a martyr to black civil rights as Martin Luther King, Medgar Evers ... or any of the other champions of the civil rights movement of the 1960s," Burlingame said.

Lincoln has not always been seen that way, and at times he has even been seen negatively.

Lincoln was viewed extremely favorably during the 1950s, but following that decade "a big change took place," historian Richard Wightman Fox said.

In the 1960s and 1970s the positive view of Lincoln as the man who freed the slaves and kept the Union together was pushed aside.

Historians and civil rights activists questioned whether Lincoln was committed enough in his push to abolish slavery, regardless of the obstacles he faced.

Liberal scholars began arguing that Lincoln pursued the Civil War for mainly economic reasons.

"Opinion about him became entirely less favorable," Fox said, though Lincoln never "faded from view."

For African-Americans, Lincoln's reputation began to decline during the Great Depression of the 1930s, when blacks suffered severe losses of jobs, said historian Edna Greene Medford.

Lincoln suddenly became a symbol of disappointment and unfulfilled promise for many African-Americans.

"These former slaves recalled what life was supposed to be and what it was not," Medford said.

"They were saying, 'Lincoln freed us, but he didn't give us anything but our freedom.

We needed land, we needed more opportunity.'"

However, the connection with Lincoln "never totally dies out," Medford said.

In 1963, King delivered his famed "I Have a Dream" speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.

King talked "about emancipation and how people are still suffering" in ways that recalled and pointed to Lincoln, Medford said.

Today, many black Americans "understand the complexity of the man," Medford said.

They "are understanding more what Lincoln was about, why he did what he did" as a leader in a more openly racist era in American history.

Newly examined letters show that Lincoln was very concerned about the suffering the Civil War caused.

James Cornelius, of the Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, said that letters Lincoln wrote to families of soldiers show the president "cared deeply, individually, about each man he sent off to war, and possible death."

The letters reflect Lincoln's "understanding of his duty as commander in chief to every soldier," Cornelius said.
