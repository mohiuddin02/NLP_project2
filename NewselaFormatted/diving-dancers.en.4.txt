Fourteen dancers got into wet suits.

They put flippers on their feet.

They wore air tanks on their backs.

Then they dived under the sea and danced.

It was the first dance like that in the world.

Their ballet is called "Drops of Breath."

They swam in the Aegean Sea near Athens, Greece.

Music came from two underwater speakers.

There were seats for people to watch underwater.

Other people could sit on land.

They could watch the dance on a giant screen.

On Friday, people had to watch the dance on land.

The water was too cloudy.

They would not be able to see much.

The dancers are mostly French and Greek.

Three dancers cannot walk on their own.

They use wheelchairs.

Three other dancers are children.

Sophie Bulbulyan and Apostolia Papadamaki invented the underwater ballet.

Sophie is from France.

Apostolia is from Greece.

They both create dances.

The two women also are divers.

They met three years ago during a dive.

They liked each other.

They began talking about dance.

After a dive, they came up with the idea of an underwater ballet, Apostolia said.

It was not easy.

Sophie said it was like trying to go the moon on a bike.

First, the dancers had to learn to dive.

They also had to learn to dance underwater.

There were many other problems.

Trifonas Koutsourelis wrote the music.

He had to learn how sound moves underwater.

People had to hear his music clearly.

Also, the dancers had to be able to dance to it.

People move more slowly underwater.

All the dancers loved dancing underwater.

The disabled dancers were especially excited, Apostolia said.

They feel equal, she said.

For the first time, they moved without a wheelchair.

Irini Kourouvani is a dancer who uses a wheelchair.

At first, she worried about the water.

But she loved it from her first dive.

Irina said she forgot to be afraid.

She said she felt like she was floating in space.
