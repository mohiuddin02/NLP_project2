The whales are called southern right whales.

It turns out that these particular whales are quite easy to spot from space, said Peter Fretwell, of the British Antarctic Survey.

They got the name because they were once considered the "right" whales to hunt because they are large and slow and spend a lot of time relaxing near the surface of calm waters.

For this reason, their numbers dropped from a pre-whaling population of 55,000-70,000 to just 300 by the 1920s.

Fretwell said what makes them the right ones to catch also make them the right ones to track by satellite.

In a paper published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One, Fretwell argues that it's possible to track the southern right whale population by satellite.

It's also more efficient than the traditional ways.

Standing on a bridge of a ship and looking out into the ocean, or gliding over the water in an airplane, are expensive and time-consuming, Fretwell  said.

Those methods are also often inaccurate.

Pictures taken by satellite are much more correct and have wider coverage, he said.

If this works, he said satellites can be used to track other types of animals as well.

Fretwell and his fellow scientists purchased a huge picture taken in September 2012 by the WorldView2 satellite.

It covers 70 square miles including an area off the Argentine coast where southern right whales are known to breed.

They also raise their young there from July through November.

The researchers looked at the same picture in different wavelengths.

One was even able to see 50 feet beneath the ocean.

They were able to spot 55 probable whales and 22 possible whales as well as 13 whale-shapes underwater.

The pictures are far from crystal clear.

And the researchers admit that the satellite system is not perfect.

After all, it is possible that a flock of birds or a large rock could be mistaken for a whale â€”or that what looks like a single whale is actually a mother whale with a calf.

These uncertainties should go away with time, scientists say.

New satellites will take higher quality pictures and will allow scientists to spot whales with greater confidence, the paper said.

Scientists already have used satellites to count populations of penguins in Antarctica, as well as seals.

The key is not the size of the animal but how much it stands out, he said.
