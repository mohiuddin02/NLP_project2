Basketball player Vaughn Gray says his game has improved.

He has noticed some big changes over the past two seasons.

Gray is now able to "see the game slower" and can "react to things" better during play.

Gray was a forward for the George Mason University (GMU) Patriots in Virginia until he finished with school.

He says his playing was helped by breathing exercises he learned.

Gray learned the exercises during several classes he and his teammates took in 2013.

The classes were part of a GMU study.

The goal of the study was to see if teaching athletes mindfulness would help them.

Mindfulness is a state of mind or way of thinking.

A mindful person is able to give complete attention to what they are doing at the moment.

At the same time, they do not try to block out their worries and fears.

Instead, they recognize and accept them.

It has long been known that an athlete's thoughts can affect their game.

For example, if an athlete is too worried about losing or feeling angry, they may end up playing badly.

Sports psychology is the usual way of dealing with that problem.

Psychology is the study of how thoughts and feelings affect behavior.

The GMU study suggests that teaching athletes mindfulness can do a lot of good.

Indeed, the approach may work better than sports psychology.

Mindfulness programs have been around for a while.

However, the GMU study added something new: yoga.

Athletes are used to physical exercise, said scientist Fallon Goodman, who led the study.

She felt that adding yoga to the study would help keep the athletes interested.

A mindfulness class is just talking for 90 minutes, she said.

The Patriots were first given a long list of questions to answer.

Then they all took eight 90-minute mindfulness classes and eight yoga classes.

The yoga classes introduced them to breathing exercises and to different ways of loosening up their bodies.

The Patriots were given a second set of questions after the classes were done.

They were asked if they noticed any changes.

The team members reported feeling more relaxed and mindful.

The new mindfulness was felt not just on the court, but in everyday life as well.

The players said they were able to concentrate more on their life goals, and to ignore peer pressure.

Gray said he got something out of both the mindfulness classes and the yoga.

"It was good to add the yoga," he said.

Gray hopes to play basketball for a living.

Meanwhile, he still does yoga "every once in a while ... because I like the way it loosens my body up."

He prefers to do it in the morning: "It wakes you up," he said.

Following the classes, the Patriots joined a much tougher basketball league.

As a result, they faced a difficult couple of seasons.

However, Gray said the team did not get upset or angry because of the mindfulness classes.

"Even though things may have been rough at the time, when we were losing or whatever, we tried to always stay as a family," he said.

Goodman said there is one big difference between mindfulness programs and sports psychology.

Sports psychologists tell athletes to push away unpleasant thoughts and feelings, she said.

With mindfulness classes, athletes learn to better understand their bad thoughts and feelings.

They accept them and learn to behave better, in sports and in life.

Goodman is certain that the yoga classes helped get the idea of mindfulness across.

Mindfulness is "hard to explain to someone and to talk about," she said.

With yoga, "you're actually kind of living it, or acting it out with your body."

In the future, many more athletes may learn to become mindful.

Goodman says "a lot of other teams are interested."

"I guess that's a sign that something went well" with the study, she said.
