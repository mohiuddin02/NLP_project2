Most people do not like waiting in line.

Parks like Disney World have lots of lines for rides and food.

They are looking for new ways to make them shorter.

Disney uses computers to speed things up.

It does not want people to get tired of waiting.

They are there to have a good time.

Things are getting better.

Lines for rides are getting shorter.

Food lines are moving faster, too.

Now people do not have to stand in line to order food.

Sometimes they can use computers to order their food.

Parks like Disney let people do that.

Sometimes people can use a cellphone to order food.

They use apps on the phone.

People can even pay for food that way.

Disney uses computers to make things faster.

Computers also help Disney save money.

Computers cost a lot of money.

Robert Niles is a writer.

He knows a lot about parks like Disney.

Robert says people visit parks for the rides.

Food is not such a big deal.

So, first they are fixing the lines for rides.

After that, they fix the lines for food.

Disney wants to get better at everything.

It has lots of ideas.

Most of their ideas have to do with computers.

One idea is to give workers computer tablets.

Workers could walk next to the lines for rides.

They could ask what people want to eat.

Then they could type it on their tablets.

People could get their food when the ride is over.

Niles likes that idea.

He says Disney still has to be careful.

Starting new things can be tricky.

A vacation is not a good time to learn something hard.

People do not want to think too much.

They just want fun rides and fast lines.
