<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20140117_CALIF_DROUGHT.jpg" />LOS ANGELES — Last week, officials of the small town of Willits, Calif., checked the two reservoirs that store all the town's water.

The news was shocking: They only had enough water to last 100 days.

It was time to get tough.

The town's 5,000 inhabitants now have to make do with a lot less water.

A family of four isn't supposed to use more than 150 gallons a day.

Outdoor watering is banned.

So is car washing.

Businesses have been ordered to cut water use by 35 percent.

As the dry weather continues, concern is growing.

It appears California may be headed for a bad drought.

It could be a replay of the big drought of the late 1980s through early 1990s.

Or, even worse, the drought of 1977.

The snow and rain might still come.

Only about half the rainy season is over.

But if the non-stop sunny weather continues, things may get nasty.

A lot of the smaller water systems "are going to be really hurting," said state water expert Maury Roos.

They don't have much water stored up.

Things aren't the same everywhere: crowded Southern California is doing all right.

It has enough water to get through the year without having to cut back.

The huge Imperial Irrigation District is also in good shape.

This region is where much of the nation's winter lettuce and vegetables are grown.

It will get the usual amount of water from the Colorado River this year.

And many growers on the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers will also do fairly well: They won't suffer more than a 25 percent cut.

But the story will be different for many San Joaquin Valley growers.

And also for ranchers.

And for communities that depend completely on their own reservoirs.

"I shudder to think if rain doesn't come," said Mendocino County official Carre Brown.

"All our reservoirs are very, very low."

Last year was California's driest year on record.

But only now is the state's water supply dipping dangerously low.

On Friday, Gov.

Jerry Brown officially declared that California is in a drought emergency.

He called it an "unprecedented," or never-before-seen, situation.

Water levels are well below average in most of the big reservoirs.

And levels are dropping when they should be rising.

Some of the worst news concerns Folsom Lake on the American River northeast of Sacramento.

The reservoir is only 18 percent full.

This is a near record low.

"Folsom Lake — it's pretty obvious there's a problem," said water manager Shauna Lorance.

Her system delivers Folsom water to the suburbs surrounding Sacramento.

And water use per person in those areas is very high: three times as high as it is in Los Angeles.

Big lawns and gardens there drain huge amounts of water.

The district has asked people to stop all outdoor watering.

If it remains dry, Lorance said, that will probably become an order.

Sacramento itself draws some supplies from the American River.

Starting Tuesday, people there will have to use 20 percent less water.

Sacramento has traditionally been something of a water hog.

It is situated on two rivers.

And its summers are scorching.

Still, water use has dropped over the last few years, said City Manager John Shirey.

And, he said, rainless seasons like this will make more people understand the need to conserve.

All the time.

Because of [climate change](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming), Shirey said, California probably will continue to have problems with its water supply.

"We just have to change, I think, the mindset here and everywhere."

The fact is, "We're going to have less water to rely on."
