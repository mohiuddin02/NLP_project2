<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/US_NEWS_BALDEAGLE_FL.jpg" />SEATTLE â€”  The government said Friday that some wind power companies will be allowed to kill, by accident, bald and golden eagles.

They'll be able to do it for up to 30 years.

And they won't get in trouble.

The White House wants to produce power from wind farms.

It wants the U.S. to use less oil and coal for power.

Those types hurt nature.

But, it also wants to preserve wildlife like the bald eagle.

The problem is that eagles die by accident when they fly into the wind farms.

The farms have turbines which spin around.

The birds get caught in them.

Groups trying to help eagles slammed the new rules.

They said it was a bad move for wildlife.

David Yarnold is president of the National Audubon Society, a group that helps save birds.

He said "it's outrageous" that the government is allowing the killing of America's symbol.

Peter Kelley works for the American Wind Energy Association.

He disagrees.

He said it's not easy for wind farms to get permits under the new rules.

They will have to list all of the different ways they'll preserve the eagles.

The government began giving permits to wind farms in 2009.

Those permits allowed for the killing of bald and golden eagles.

Both types of eagles are protected by the government.

The permits lasted five years at most.

Wind businesses said that was not enough.

They said the permits needed to be longer.

Otherwise it wouldn't be worth spending money to build wind power farms.

The new rules extend the permits.

But, to no more than 30 years.

And, they will be given only to companies that make sure eagles are preserved.

Kelley said the new rules would "increase the protection of eagles and will help develop more wind farms."

He said wind farms are important.

They can help stop climate change.

Climate change is a shift in weather patterns.

It's thought to be caused in part by humans burning fuels.

That leads to [global warming](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming).

He says that climate change is "the No.

1 threat to all eagles and all wildlife."

Not wind farms.

Under the new rules, permits will be looked at every five years.

And the number of eagle deaths will be counted.

Population levels of the birds will be checked.

Government officials could make companies change their ways to kill fewer eagles.

And they could take away their permits.

But the American Bird Conservancy says that the new rules are voluntary.

Wind farms don't have to pay attention to them.

And it said the government is asking the companies to say if they've killed the eagles.

No one is checking up on them.

Kelley, from the American Wind Energy Association, said that wind farms hadn't had a big effect on bald eagles.

He said that only a tiny amount of the golden eagles killed by humans died because of wind farms.

The population of golden eagles in the West isn't going down, he said.

It might even be going up.

Michael Hutchins is an expert on wind power at the bird conservancy.

He pointed to a new study.

It found that 573,000 birds and 888,000 bats are killed every year by wind farms.

And that could get worse, Hutchins said.

The White House wants 12 times more energy to come from wind and the sun by 2030.

He asked, "If it's not done right, what kind of an impact is that going to have on birds and bats?"

Fifty years ago, chemicals were the greatest danger to eagles.

They were used on crops to kill bugs.

And, now, it's wind power.

But, he supports wind power.

"But it ought to be done right," Hutchins said.

It's not helping nature "if it's killing hundreds of thousands of birds and bats annually and if it's killing large numbers of protected eagles."
