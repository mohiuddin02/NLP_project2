There is a new exhibition at The Dali Museum in Florida.

Visitors will not just look at art.

They will feel like they are walking around inside a painting.

Virtual reality will make this experience possible.

VR is a three-dimensional world created by computers.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/disneydali.jpg"/> The new exhibition is called "Disney and Dali: Architects of the Imagination."

It tells the story of a friendship between two men, Salvador Dali and Walt Disney.

Dali was a famous artist known for his unusual paintings, sculptures, and life-size art. Disney was the great American animator and creator of Disneyland.  Visitors will first look at the two friends' paintings, story ideas, letters and photos.

Then they will put on a headset and try the virtual reality (VR) experience.

It is called "Dreams of Dali."

The VR movie takes viewers inside a Dali painting.

It is called "Archaeological Reminiscence of Millet's 'Angelus.'"

In the painting, giant stone figures are in the middle of a desert. There are elephants and birds. Users can move around.

They feel like they are moving up through a stone tunnel.

They hear piano music and the cries of birds.  "You actually have a three-dimensional feeling that you're inside a painting. It's not like anything you've ever felt before," said Jeff Goodby.

His company is called Goodby Silverstein & Partners.

They created the VR experience.

It seems like there are objects closer and farther away as you are walking by them, he added.  Hank Hine runs the museum.

He said Disney and Dali met in Hollywood in 1940\.

They had the same interests.

Both wanted to take art off the paint canvas and out into the world, he said.

The exhibition shows drawings of the castles that Walt Disney loved.

The castle became a symbol of Disney parks.

The exhibit also looks at Dali's "Dream of Venus" pavilion from the 1939 World's Fair.

It was a huge piece of art.

It was the size of building, both inside and out.

It was like a dream world with an inside swimming pool.

Dali led the way for many other artists to create large works of art.

Disney and Dali also worked on a short animated movie called "Destino."

The six-minute movie can be found on YouTube.

It features a dancing girl with long dark hair, and a song with the line, "You came along out of a dream.

... You are my destino."

Clips will be played within the gallery for the Disney-Dali exhibition.

The full movie will be shown at the museum's theater.

People can also see the Dali painting that inspired the VR experience at the museum.

"Archeological Reminiscence of Millet's 'Angelus'" was first done by an artist from the 1800s named Jean-Francois Millet.

Dali then painted the same picture.

Dali's version shows two workers in a field.

Their heads are bowed in prayer.

Dali said that his work was a fantasy.

He imagined sculptures of two figures carved out of the highest rocks.

Kathy Greif works at the museum.

She said many visitors came to see its last two big shows.

Those exhibits explored Dali's friendships with artists Andy Warhol and Pablo Picasso.

Many people love Disney and want to try VR.

She thinks many visitors will come to see this show, too.

Dali "wanted art that took you over," said Goodby.

"He wanted to take you away and do something different with your head and that's what this does."
