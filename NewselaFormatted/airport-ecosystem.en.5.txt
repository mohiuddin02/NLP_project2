Steve Osmek is a wildlife biologist.

He studies living things.

He works at the Seattle-Tacoma Airport.

It's his job to make sure animals play nice with planes.

He's responsible for everything that moves and has legs.

Sometimes, he just needs a fence to keep them out.

There's a tall fence around the airport.

It keeps coyotes and deer away from the runways.

But it gets more complicated with birds.

When birds hit planes, it costs airlines lots of money.

It can hurt people, too.

You can't fence birds out.

So Osmek tries other things.

Osmek has to think about plants.

The grass is cut short.

That way, rats and bugs that birds eat will stay away.

Plants with berries, nuts and seeds are few.

Birds like to eat those plants.

The airport plants shrubs to keep birds from nesting.

Sea-Tac was the first airport to hire a wildlife biologist.

A few others now have the biologists, too.

Airports are working harder to keep birds away.

It seems to be working.

There are more planes and animals around.

But there are fewer accidents.

Osmek traps and moves many birds.

His team tags them and takes them away.

Some birds are killed.

Their bodies go to the Burke Museum for classes to study.

Seattle is the first airport with bird radar.

The system is better now than when it started.

Airport workers would answer any time a bird showed up.

But by the time they got there, the bird would be gone.

Now they know to look only for flocks.

When they find them, they scare them away with loud noises.

There's no way for an airport to be perfectly friendly to nature.

People are mixing with wildlife.

But the wildlife was there first.

People can play by nature's rules, and not fight.

And that's why even airports need a wildlife biologist.
