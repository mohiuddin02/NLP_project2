Home-cooked meals are better for you.

Michelle Obama has a new plan to get young people healthier.

The first lady wants people to cook more meals at home.

Home-cooked meals are healthier.

They also save money.

Obama spoke at a health meeting in Washington on Friday.

Home-cooked meals have less fat and salt than restaurant meals.

Fat and salt can cause heart disease.

Too many people think they don't have the time to cook.

People also think they aren't good enough cooks.

But plenty of meals can be cooked in less than 30 minutes, she said.

Growing up, Obama said her own mother cooked at home.

Her mother planned meals in advance.

She shopped for groceries every Saturday.

Obama is worried that too many children are at an [unhealthy weight](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity).

Having too much body fat is not healthy.

It can lead to health problems as adults.

The first lady promised that she won't give up on this.

She believes in finishing what she starts.

Every child should have a chance for a healthy life, she said.

The body weight of children ages 2 to 5 is improving.

She said this is a small, though important, step.

But the problem isn't solved.

Mrs. Obama urged everyone to keep working.

Schools are beginning to serve healthier meals.

Obama said the schools should teach students basic cooking skills.

Some food makers promised to make healthier foods.

Among them was yogurt maker Dannon.

It plans to make foods with less sugar and fat.
