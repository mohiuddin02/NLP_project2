On Thursday the government announced changes to the way food is labeled.

The changes are the biggest in more than 20 years.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20140227_FOODLABELS.jpg" /> The new food labels provide more information.

For example, they show how much sugar has been added.

And they are based on new, mostly larger serving sizes.

These reflect how people really eat.

The changes are meant to help in the fight against some serious health problems.

Among these are obesity.

An [obese](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity) person is someone who is very overweight.

Far too many Americans are obese.

The public will be allowed to comment on the planned changes.

Final rules for the new labels will be released within a year.

Government officials believe the new labels will be helpful.

They will allow shoppers to make healthier choices.

And they may encourage food companies to cut down on added sugars.

First lady Michelle Obama was to announce the new labels from the White House.

She has made better eating an important part of her "Let's Move!"

campaign.

Its goal is battling obesity in children.

When you "walk into your local grocery store," she said, there shouldn't be any mystery.

You should be able to tell if something is "good for your family."

Nutrition labels are found on about 700,000 products.

The new labels will be easier to read.

And there will be more information about sugar.

For the first time, two kinds of sugar will be listed separately: natural sugar and added sugar.

Natural sugar is already in some healthy food, such as fruit.

Added sugar is put in by food companies.

Government officials said knowing the difference is important.

It will help shoppers cut down on unhealthy added sugar.

Nutrition expert Marion Nestle said food companies may object.

They really don't want you to "know how much sugar there is," she said.

Some claim the new labels don't go far enough.

They shouldn't just give the amount of sugar, argued scientist Michael F. Jacobson.

They should also say how that amount compares to another number: the total amount it's safe to take in every day.

Many people get far too much sugar, he said.

The American Heart Association recommends that people take in very little added sugar: For women, no more than 25 grams a day.

And for men, no more than 35 grams a day.

One can of soda alone contains about 40 grams.

The new labels will also change serving sizes.

The serving size for soda, for example, is now 8 ounces.

That amount is supposed to equal how much people usually drink at one time.

However, people often drink 12-ounce cans or even larger bottles.

The new serving size for soda will have to be at least 12 ounces.

There will be an increase for some other products, such as ice cream.

"The serving sizes for many foods are a joke now," said Jacobson.

Look at "the half-cup of ice cream" or "2-ounce muffins and bagels."

Few people eat that little at one time.

Some packaged foods and drinks are usually finished all at once.

These will be scored differently on the new labels.

Nutrition information will be given for the entire package, not just the serving size.

This would be the case, for example, with a 20-ounce soda bottle.

There will also be new rules for another kind of food or drink: a food package that is two times the serving size and could be finished all at once.

For example, a 24-ounce soda bottle would contain two servings of 12 ounces.

The food label would be required to have two columns.

One column would give nutritional information based on serving size.

The other would be based on container size.

Officials said obesity was one of the main reasons for the update.

They admitted that the new labels alone will not solve the problem.

But, they said, they believe the labels can help.
