A good pushup can be more important than a great fastball.

Trainers want to know if kids can do a pushup without wobbling.

Are they able to touch their toes?

Pull up to their chin?

Can they move back and forth?

Playing soccer or baseball is fine.

But trainers want kids to learn how to move correctly and safely.

Simple movements make great athletes.

These movements include skipping, twisting, jumping, stopping and starting.

Proper movement also leads to lifelong fitness, said Larry Meadors.

He was a high school coach.

Correct movement can also lead to good health.

But people don't know how to move correctly, Meadors said.

He compared moving well with learning to read.

"We all learned the alphabet," he said.

Then kids put two letters together, then three and four letters to form words.

"And pretty soon we had a word, a sentence, a paragraph, a chapter, a book."

The same thing goes for sports.

Movements are the building blocks of sports.

If kids don't move right in sports, they can get hurt.

There a lot of reasons why kids get hurt.

Few kids take regular fitness classes.

Few schools offer gym class every day.

[People also are less active.

Kids learn to play a sport.

But they don't usually learn how to move their body so they don't get hurt.

In soccer and baseball, kids use one arm or leg more than the other.

Kids tend to kick with one leg in soccer.

They also tend to throw with one arm in baseball.

This makes the other arm or leg weak.

And this can cause kids to get hurt.

Also, kids aren't strong enough.

Many kids don't know how to slow down and stop when running.

Others don't know how to land a jump correctly.

This also can cause an injury.

More than 3.5 million kids under 15 get hurt in sports.

The injuries are increasing.

"There's something wrong about that," Meadors said.
