The United Arab Emirates is a country in the Middle East with lots of oil and lots of money.

It is known for its flashy hotels and dry deserts.

Now the country wants to have a lot of art, as well.

The country has spent $550 million on art for a new museum in the capital, Abu Dhabi.

The Louvre Abu Dhabi will open its doors in December 2015.

The Louvre in Paris is one of the world's biggest and most famous museums.

Last week, it showed the 160 pieces of art the Abu Dhabi project has bought.

The United Arab Emirates has spent a lot of money.

It bought lots of different types of art.

It bought works by famous artists such as Pablo [Picasso](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Picasso).

It also bought religious items, like a Torah from the 1800s and a Bible from the 1200s.

The exhibition in Paris was called "Birth of a Museum."

France's president, Francois Hollande, was there to open it.

Khalid Abdulkhaliq Abdulla helped put together the exhibition.

He wants visitors to come to Abu Dhabi for the art.

Abu Dhabi plans to build a museum district.

One of the other museums will be a branch of New York's Guggenheim.

But some people in France say that money can't buy culture.

Jean Nouvel designed the Abu Dhabi Louvre museum.

He said these people are wrong.

He thinks they are jealous.

That's because Europe now doesn't have the money to pay for big new museums.

Vincent Pomerade works for the museum.

He said Abu Dhabi today is like the U.S. one hundred years ago.

Then, the U.S. was becoming rich.

And private collectors started buying a lot of art and opening museums to show it.

"During this period we said the same thing," said Pomerade.

But European and Asian art helped make American culture, he said.

Also, many European art collections were built by stealing from other countries, said Julian Radcliffe.

He tracks stolen and missing works of art.

"Buying in culture is far better than looting it," he said.
