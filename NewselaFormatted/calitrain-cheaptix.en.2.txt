<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20150526_Bullet_fare.png" /> LOS ANGELES — Riding California's bullet train from Los Angeles to San Francisco was supposed to cost "about $50 a person."

The train's supporters told voters about the fare and the train project raised billions in funding.

Now the state estimates an average ticket would cost $86.

The estimate would still make the train one of the world's cheapest high-speed rail trips, the Los Angeles Times found.

It based the comparison on the price per mile for bullet trains in different countries.

No one can really say how much a ride on the bullet train would actually cost if and when the system is finished.

The state says the train should be running full-time in 2028.

At that point, ticket prices will be set in consultation with a private company, said Jeff Morales, CEO of the California High-Speed Rail Authority.

The price of the ride will be one of the most important things to consider when millions of travelers are deciding whether to take the high-speed train.

They could choose to fly or drive instead.

It is also important for the government to get the fares right.

By state law, the train system must operate without having to ask for extra money from taxpayers.

Morales and other state officials say the system will quickly make money.

But critics and some experts disagree.

They say long-range financial and ridership forecasts can be unreliable.

They worry the high-speed train could become a financial burden on the state.

Whenever you try to make projections more than five years away, you are just guessing, said Lisa Schweitzer.

She teaches classes on transportation and urban planning at the University of Southern California (USC).

"So many things can change dramatically in five years," she said.

According to official ridership estimates, between 18 million and 31 million passengers will board the train every year in its early years.

The project's most recent business plan predicts that by 2030, ticket sales will hit $2 billion a year.

The ticket sales would be $700 million a year more than the costs of the bullet train.

Even if only 18 million people rode the train every year, state officials say, the train system would pay for itself.

The current $86 fare is based on a formula.

The calculation averages the cost of airline fares.

Then the train costs around 83 percent of that average.

The $86 is also an average.

There could be premium tickets that cost more.

Still, compared with current average prices on high-speed rail systems in Asia and Europe, $86 would be a bargain.

The fare would be about 20 cents a mile or less, the Los Angeles Times found.

The average fare on Italy's 434-mile bullet train from Milan to Salerno was 25 cents a mile.

The fare on China's 809-mile line between Beijing and Shanghai was 22 cents a mile.

China discloses little about its high-speed rail finances.

Many experts say the Chinese government gives a lot of extra money to help reduce fares, as do many other foreign operators.

The French bullet train from Paris to Lyon is known to make money.

However, it also costs a lot — 52 cents per mile.

The German bullet train from Hanover to Wurzburg charges 46 cents per mile.

Amtrak's Acela system on the East Coast is the closest thing to high-speed rail in the United States.

It charges an average of about 50 cents a mile for the 454-mile trip between Washington and Boston.

Louis Thompson is in charge of a state-created review panel for the bullet train project.

He said California's projected fares are low by world standards.

The train system is expected to make extra money from advertising and other things.

Still, some outside experts questioned whether California's bullet train fares will be able to cover the system's full operating costs.

"The train will lose money and require" money from the state, said Joseph Vranich, former president of the national High-Speed Rail Association.

"I have not seen a single number that has come out of the California high-speed rail organization that is credible."

Since Vranich has supported high-speed rail, he said he is angry with what he sees as bad information.

William Grindley, a former World Bank executive and an opponent of the bullet train project, has warned that the system will fail financially unless more people want to use it and ticket prices increase.

Can the California bullet train pay for itself?

Grindley said the answer is definitely no.

Grindley wrote a 2012 report that concluded the system would require extra state money "forever."

He said the state would need between $123 million and $1 billion or more from taxpayers every year.

Morales, the rail authority's chief executive officer, said past analyses by Grindley's group have been wrong.

He said his agency's predictions of how many people would ride the train are accurate.

He said they were checked and approved by a panel of outside experts.

When we say the train can pay for itself, "we have a lot of reliability in the statement," Morales said.
