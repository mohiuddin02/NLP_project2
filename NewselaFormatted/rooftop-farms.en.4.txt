Chicago is a green city.

It has many gardens on top of buildings.

People there are now building farms on rooftops.

It is an idea many other cities are trying, too.

Rooftop farms are sprouting all around Chicago.

You can see them on big buildings.

One group is making the biggest one in the world this summer.

Even small stores and schools have gardens on roofs there.

There are 13 rooftop farms in Chicago.

There could soon be more.

Other cities are doing it too.

Washington, D.C., has three rooftop farms.

Toronto, in Canada, has two.

Michael Bryson is a teacher at a school in Chicago.

He says rooftop farms are a very good idea.

Farming in cities helps us to learn about food.

The people of Chicago really like city gardens and farming, he said.

The last mayor of Chicago was Richard M. Daley.

He went on a trip to Germany.

There, he saw a rooftop garden for the first time.

When he came back, he built one on top of Chicago's city hall.

No one knows how many farms are on roofs in the United States.

They are most popular in Washington and Chicago.

Chicago is like New York.

It has lots of tall buildings with flat roofs.

They are perfect for rooftop farming.

Some rooftop farms are inside greenhouses.

They can use computers to know how hot or how cold it is.

This means Chicago's cold winters are not a problem.

People can use computers to change heat and light.

Then plants will grow better.
