Pardeep Kaleka spent several days after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks at his father's South Milwaukee gas station, fearing that his family would be targeted by people who assumed they were Muslim.

No, Kaleka explained, the family was Sikh, a southeast Asian religion based on equality and not related to Islam.

But there has been a new wave of anti-Islamic sentiment since the terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino.

Now Kaleka is vowing to take an entirely different approach.

"For us it does not matter who they're targeting," said Kaleka.

He is a former Milwaukee police officer and teacher whose father was one of six people killed in 2012 when a white supremacist opened fire at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin.

"This time we cannot differentiate ourselves; when hate rhetoric is being spewed we cannot be on the sidelines."

Across the United States, Sikhs and Muslims are banding together to defend their religions.

Someone bent on harming Muslims wouldn't understand — or care about — the distinction between the two faiths, which both deserve to live in peace.

So they plan educational sessions and rallies and successfully pushed the FBI to track hate crimes against Sikhs.

They speak to lawmakers and support each other's legal action.

One such action is a lawsuit filed over a New York City police surveillance program that kept a close watch on Muslims.

"We are in this fight together," said Gurjot Kaur, a attorney at The Sikh Coalition, which was founded the night of Sept. 11, attacks.

Sikhism, a monotheistic faith like Christianity, Judaism and Islam, was founded more than 500 years ago in Southeast Asia.

It has roughly 27 million followers worldwide, most of them in India.

There are more than 500,000 Sikhs in the U.S.

Male followers often cover their heads with turbans, which are considered sacred, and do not shave their beards.

Reports of bullying, harassment and vandalism against Sikhs have risen in recent weeks.

Last week, a Sikh temple in Orange County, California, was vandalized.

A truck in the temple's parking lot was also damaged.

Someone had tried to write the word "Islam" on it and made an obscene reference to the Islamic State extremist group (also known as ISIS and ISIL).

A Sikh woman who is nursing a child said she recently was forced to show her breast pump before taking her seat on an airplane in Minneapolis.

Another passenger thought she might be an extremist and carrying a bomb.

Several Sikh football fans said they initially were not allowed into Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego to watch a football game last Sunday because some of them were wearing turbans.

Schoolchildren also say they've been bullied.

For most Sikhs, much of the backlash has been frequent stares or comments and occasional online insults.

Former NCAA basketball player Darsh Singh said he has heard insults throughout his life.

Recently, someone yelled "Osama!"

at him as he was crossing a street, referring to Osama Bin Laden, who was responsible for the 9/11 attacks.

Then last week, a photo on Facebook showed the former Trinity University basketball player — the first turbaned Sikh to play in the NCAA — with the caption, "Nobody wants to guard Muhammad, he's too explosive."

A friend came to his defense with a lengthy post.

"Do the world a favor and educate yourself," said the post, which got tens of thousands of likes.

"A lot of people act out of fear or ignorance," said Singh.

"I don't know who started it, but whoever they are, I forgive them."

Rajinder Singh Mago is the community outreach director at the Sikh Religious Society of Chicago.

He said it's especially difficult for Sikh schoolchildren, who sometimes are bullied.

"Ninety-nine percent of Americans are good ... then that one person who just came out of a tavern after a few beers, you don't know what he's thinking at that point," Mago said.

Madihha Ahussain is a staff attorney at the national group Muslim Advocates.

She said people who are misinformed about both religions not only are "blaming entire faith communities, now they're blaming multiple groups for the acts of a couple of individuals."

As a result, some Sikhs have been the victims of violence.

A Chicago-area teenager was charged with a hate crime against a Sikh taxi driver.

He allegedly called the 53-year-old man "Bin Laden" and repeatedly hit him in the face, breaking his cheekbone.

In 2013, a Green Bay, Wisconsin, man was charged with a hate crime.

He allegedly set fire to a convenience store owned by a Sikh-American.

That was less than a year after white supremacist Wade Michael Page killed six people and wounded four others at the Oak Creek temple.

Kaleka said his father, Satwant Singh Kaleka, was the last person killed inside the temple, after Page broke into an office where he was calling 911.

Kaleka said the Muslim community reached out to Sikhs after the attack, and members of both faiths — along with Christians, Jews and others — are continuing to work together to combat inflammatory speech.

Last weekend, he spoke at a Muslim women's coalition.

"I think this is just another test," Kaleka said.

"Unfortunately," he added, "I think as bad as the comments are from some politicians, it does surface some underlying issues we haven't addressed."
