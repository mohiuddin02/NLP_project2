There were ideas about how the universe worked.

But scientists did not know how the small blocks, or particles, could form the world we know today.

Two physicists, Francous Englert of Belgium and Peter Higgs of Britain, had a thought.

They came up with the idea of the Higgs particle.

It was also known as the Higgs boson.

Some people even call it the "God particle."

Last year, scientists at CERN laboratory in Geneva showed that a Higgs boson actually existed.

On Tuesday, Englert and Higgs won the Nobel Prize in physics.

The 80-year-old Englert said he did not imagine getting a Nobel Prize when he stated the research 50 years ago.

"You don't work thinking to get the Nobel Prize, that's not how you work," Englert said.

But he and Higgs, now 84, believed they were doing something important back then, he said.

They thought their work "would later on be used by other researchers."

Giving the award to just Englert and Higgs bsp;solved a tricky problem for the Nobel committee.

It did not have to choose one of the thousands of scientists at CERN to share the award.

Only three people can split the prize at most, according to the rules.

Academy member Ulf Danielsson noted that the prize document also praised the work done at CERN.

He also said the discovery was a major event in the history of physics.

Physics is the study of energy and matter, or what stuff is made of.

"This is a giant discovery," Danielsson said.

Englert and Higgs came up with the idea of the Higgs particle to answer a riddle: Why matter has mass.

They believed the tiny particle acts like molasses on snow.

It made other basic building blocks of nature stick together, slow down and form atoms.

Without it, they would never come together.

The universe would just be a bunch of particles flying around.

Scientists wanted to know how matter formed shortly after the Big Bang.

They had the idea that there is an invisible field throughout the universe.

Particles travel through the field.

They are slowed down like a ball rolling through sticky molasses.

If this is true, then it should be possible to find a type of particle that makes the others slow down and stick together.

The particle was named the Higgs boson.

It took about 50 years before scientists at CERN were able to show its existence.

They finally did this in July 2012.

To find it, they had to build a $10 billion collider.

It is located in a 17-mile tunnel beneath the Swiss-French border.

Scientists used the collider to slam trillions of protons into each other.

The protons collided.

The crashes produced energy.

It was just like right after the Big Bang that supposedly marked the origin of the universe.

Scientists examined information from the collisions.

They eventually found proof that the Higgs boson exists.

Michael Turner is president a group of physicists.

He said the Higgs particle captured the imagination of the public.

"If you're a physicist, you can't get in a taxi anywhere in the world without having the driver ask you about the Higgs particle," said Turner.

He is also a scientist at the University of Chicago.

The announcement was widely expected.

But it was delayed an hour.

A delay almost never happens.

The academy decides the winners on the day of the announcement.

The academy's Staffan Normark said the group tried to reach Higgs on Tuesday.

They could not reach him on the phone numbers he gave.

Normark wouldn't say if that's why the announcement was delayed.

The Nobel prizes were established by Swedsh businessman Alfred Nobel.

Each prize is worth $1.2 million.
