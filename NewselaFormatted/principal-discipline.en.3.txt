But last school year, things got really out of control.

In March, 36 teachers and workers filed a complaint against the school and students.

Children were attacking adults.

They took drugs in school and made rude noises in class.

By the end of the school year, nearly half of the students had been suspended.

"When someone says Spurgeon, it's like the worst thing in the world," a parent told the school's new principal Todd Irving.

Spurgeon is in Santa Ana.

Irving was hired over the summer to get Spurgeon under control.

Irving was a basketball player when he was in college, and he had two main goals.

First, he wanted to make students follow small rules, like get to class on time.

Second, he wanted to give troublemakers some attention.

Before school began, Irving asked the school to put together a list of the school's 50 most difficult students.

He promised to be responsible for them.

Spurgeon is located in a very poor area.

At Spurgeon, "you aren't going to have that kid who has a desk to work at at home.

You aren't going to have that kid who has the laptop at home," he said.

So how do you give them an equal chance to succeed, he asked.

Over the summer, Irving met with each of the 50 difficult students and their parents.

The meetings helped Irving understand the problems they faced at home.

Some of the students don't have beds to sleep in.

There are boys whose fathers are serving life sentences in prison.

Others have mothers who are being sent back to the countries they were born in.

The mothers came to the U.S. illegally and are being being deported.

There are students addicted to drugs.

Irving likes making lists.

He especially likes setting goals.

He set goals for the 50 troublemakers.

Each was asked to sign a contract.

They promised to come to class every day and follow the rules.

"One thing I firmly believe is kids make mistakes," Irving said.

The second morning, Irving explained the rules to students.

Students are expected to pick up their own garbage and get to class on time.

There will be no fighting, no gangs, no stink bombs, no matches.

Students won't threaten anyone, Irving told them.

That afternoon, a father told Irving his son was being bullied.

The father was so angry he was almost crying.

The troublemaker was a skinny eighth-grader.

He had braces and spiked hair.

His name was Ernesto.

Irving called Ernesto into his office.

His mother, a translator, and a school police officer came also.

The police officer told Ernesto that Spurgeon is now like a new school.

"Who's the man in charge?"

asked the officer.

"Him," Ernesto said quietly, looking at Irving.

Irving asked Ernesto to sign the contract.

During the day, students are in and out of Irving's office.

He meets with parents.

He also sends school workers to visit students who don't show up for school.

Sometimes Irving pulls troublemakers out of class.

Irving lets them sit in his office, doing homework or just talking.

So far, fewer kids have been suspended from school.

Also 38 of the 50 troublemakers are behaving better.

Still, the biggest problem is learning.

Irving wants to improve the school's test scores by 50 points.

That would be a big achievement for the school.

But it is still lower than it should be.

Irving said that students are on their best behavior at the beginning of the year.

By spring, things can get out of control if the rules aren't enforced.

So Irving is trying not to get comfortable.
