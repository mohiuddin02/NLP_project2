The 2022 Winter Olympics will be in Beijing.

Beijing is the capital of China.

China is in Asia.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) runs the Olympics.

It chose Beijing over Almaty.

Almaty is in Kazakhstan.

The vote was very close.

The vote was 44 to 40.

The IOC thought Beijing was a good choice.

China has the most people in the world.

There are more than 1 billion people in China.

Kazakhstan is a much smaller country.

It has just 11 million people.

The 2008 Summer Olympics was in Beijing.

The IOC knew China could plan a successful Olympics.

The IOC vote had to be done two times.

The first time was on computers.

They did not work.

The group decided to vote again with pencils and paper.

Thomas Bach is the IOC president.

He said the group wanted to make sure the vote was fair.

Beijing was the big favorite.

But the city does not get any snow.

For sports like skiing, it will use fake snow.

The Olympics have never been in Central Asia.

Almaty wanted to bring it to Central Asia for the first time.

Karim Massimov is the head of the government in Kazakhstan.

He told the IOC to be "brave" and let the Games come to his country.

He said it would prove something important.

That Olympics could be in small countries.

Most IOC members were surprised by the close vote.

John Coates works at the IOC.

He said Kazakhstan almost won.

The members liked Karim Massimov's speech.

But China is much bigger.

It has many more people.

They can learn about winter sports.

China is very powerful.

There was another reason.

Kazakhstan only became a country in 1991.

The city might to try to get the Olympics again.
