The anti-poverty charity Oxfam published the report.

The study says that the world's poorest 3.55 billion people must live on the same amount of money as the richest 85 people.

In other words: Just one of those 85 people has as much money as about 42 million of the world's poor.

That's as many people as there are in Canada, Kentucky and Kansas, put together.

The report was released right before The World Economic Forum, which opens on Wednesday in Switzerland.

It is a gathering spot for international leaders in politics, education and business.

With the release of the study, Oxfam's website said the growing wealth gap is weakening democracy.

The past 25 years have seen more and more money go to fewer and fewer people, the website said.

"The wealth of the 1 percent richest people in the world amounts to $110 trillion.

That's 65 times the total wealth of the bottom half."

The report says 210 people became billionaires last year.

Now the world's total billionaire population is around 1,400.

In 2008, banking systems and stock markets went into crisis.

Many people lost their homes, savings or jobs.

The report said that while the crisis hurt the world's poor, it ended up helping the rich elite.

The very richest people on Earth collected almost all of the wealth that was created after the crisis, the report said.

The trend of the rich getting richer while the poor get poorer is more present in the United States than in other countries, the report said.

But it is not just in the U.S.

It said that Colombia and the Netherlands were the only two countries in the world that did not have the share of wealth from the richest 1 percent of people go up between 1980 and 2012.

The report said that in the United States, China and Portugal, the wealthiest 1 percent had seen its share of income more than double in the same period.

Oxfam urged countries to take steps to make sure laws and rules didn't make the situation worse.

When there is growth and less inequality, the report said, the rules of business work to help the middle classes and the poorest sections of society.

But, the report continued, when only the rich are making money, the rules start bending to help only the rich.
