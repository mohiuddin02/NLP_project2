Imagine the award-winning photo taken by Time magazine's Instagram Photographer of the Year.

What is the first thing you think off?

A perfectly timed picture of an amazing football catch?

A funny photo that lets you take a peek at one of your favorite stars?

How about a hard-to-get shot taken from a dangerous scene like a storm or a war?

Matt Black pictures something entirely different.

He won Time's Instagram award in 2014, but he did not do it with a photo of someone famous.

Black prefers to photograph California's Central Valley farmworkers.

He feels their stories are more important than stories about singers and movie stars.

He wants people to see their hard work and sunburned faces.

Black's work gives people a closer look at farming and how the lack of rainfall and drought has affected farmers' lives.

His photos show the tough lives of the workers who help make our meals possible.

Black has stuck with this kind of work for more than 25 years.

He does not care if people think it is boring or sad.

Black's project choices are not the only thing that sets him apart from other photographers.

The way he takes photos is also quite different.

Black does not jump around from one project to the next â€” his stories are too important to rush.

It can take Black months to really get to know a story, and sometimes it can even take years.

He spends a long time getting to know the people in his pictures.

He knows he can get better shots if they trust him and want to help him.

Last time there was a big drought, Black rented an apartment near farmworkers for three months.

He wanted to stay close to the project.

It helped him get a feel for what it is like to be a part of that community and understand what tough times are like for them.

Black got hooked on black-and-white photography in high school.

He got to try it while working weekends at a newspaper.

One day in 1988, Black volunteered to cover a story about a leader of farmworkers named Cesar Chavez that nobody else wanted to do.

It was important to him, so he went on his own to shoot the pictures.

His boss ended up printing them in the newspaper.

Black says it showed him what photography can do.

"Because I went on my own, the story got published," he said.

"It was based on nothing more than the fact that I did it."

Even after college, Black kept doing whatever he wanted to do.

He could have gotten a steady job taking pictures for a magazine or newspaper, but he chose to do lots of small jobs instead.

They did not pay as much, but he got to pick the projects he wanted.

He got to take pictures that mattered to him.

Black had an especially good year in 2014.

The New Yorker magazine published eight pages of his photos.

His work was also featured at an art gallery in New York City.

Black has also received support from MSNBC.com to help pay for his "Geography of Poverty" project.

Now Black can spend three months traveling across the country and taking pictures.

He wants to show that other areas have some of the same struggles he sees in California.

Black has become a lot more famous lately, but he is still humble.

He did not shout and celebrate when he won the Time magazine award.

That just isn't his way.

Black is a quiet man, but he is still thankful for the extra attention.

He knows it means more people will see his work.

When they do, he knows more people will start to care about the people in the photographs.

"I've devoted myself to these images," Black says.

"That's the one voice I have.

I've got a lot I want to say."
