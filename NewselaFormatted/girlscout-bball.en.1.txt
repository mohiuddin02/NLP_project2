The Girl Scout stands shyly on the edge of a basketball court.

It is not a full court, not even a half court.

But it is enough of a court to hold jump shots and heaps of laughter loud enough to drown out the cars whooshing through the city streets.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/bball.png"/> It is a Thursday after school.

A bunch of kids are joyfully running around the court as if they had just burst out from behind locked doors into fresh air â€” and they have.

The court is located in the front yard of a Door of Hope apartment building for women and children who have been left homeless.

The 18 children who live in this building rarely play outside.

This court is their place, where they can run and shout and still be safe.

It has been open only a month, but it is already filled every afternoon with kids who can talk about their sadness and share their dreams.

"I know, I know," Claire Dundee, 16, said with a smile.

"People say, 'You're still a Girl Scout?

Isn't that for second-graders?'"

The Girl Scout is visiting the basketball court because she built it.

With her wits and willpower, Dundee arranged and supervised the construction of the court to earn her Girl Scout Gold Award.

It is the Girl Scouts' highest honor.

She raised the money, convinced the builder, worked with the architect, and even pushed the wheelbarrow.

In the beginning, she was scared to phone strangers so she wrote down a script before every call.

But by the end, she was making sure that the concrete was poured correctly.

From the time she first threw a basketball when she was little, Dundee realized that a basketball court wasn't really about basketball.

"For me, it was about bonding, sharing, becoming a family," she said.

Last spring, she met with officials from Door of Hope, who gave her ideas like building bookcases or planting bushes for her project.

Then one of the employees threw out a completely crazy idea: If Dundee really wanted to help, she could turn one of their building's dusty yards into a basketball court.

"It's a huge need for us to have a space for children to have a safe place to play," said Tim Peters, the head of Door of Hope.

For them, "to be able to do kid things, that's such a big thing."

He was worried, though, about a Girl Scout taking on such a big project.

"A lot of people said I was crazy, but I knew something like that would last forever," she said.

And after all, she thought, how hard could it be?

Raise some money to buy a goal and some balls, get a builder to donate a concrete slab, no big deal.

She could surely finish it during the summer before starting her third year of high school, right?

"Pretty soon it became obvious that this was going to be overwhelming," she said.

She collected boxes of junk from friends and held a giant sale in a vacant lot.

She made $1,700, but needed more money, so she personally called everyone's parents and begged them for donations.

The project took nearly three weeks, with five workers, at a cost of about $25,000\.

Dundee would show up every day after school to check on everything from leveling the court to pouring concrete.

She even pulled weeds and planted bushes.

Finally, on Dec. 22, in a light rain, a dozen kids splashed out to their new basketball court to celebrate.

"It was my favorite part of the project, seeing the kids fight over the balls and run out there and just start shooting," Dundee recalled.

"I just stood back and watched.

It was really something."

The Door of Hope folks were even more impressed.

"It's amazing that a kid can have an idea and end up serving other kids in the community," said Nicole Peters, who is with Door of Hope.

"It gives me faith in humanity."

On Thursday, 11-year-old Arman ran up and down the small court with huge beads of sweat and a tired smile.

"Before this, I would be in my apartment, bored, doing nothing," Arman said.

"Now it's like I'm really home."

On another part of the court, a woman named Susana said she could see Dundee's influence on her 11-year-old son, Jonathan.

"I can see a smile on his face, a change in him, he can come downstairs and just play and be a kid," she said.

"Who knew a court could be so important?"
