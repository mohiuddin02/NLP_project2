People have five senses.

They are sight, sound, touch, smell and taste.

When we eat food, we use the sense of taste.

It gives us the good feeling when we eat cake.

It makes us happy when we eat pizza.

Scientists knew about four kinds of taste.

They were sweet, sour, salty and bitter.

Later, a Japanese scientist found another taste.

It is called umami.

It is in food that has a strong flavor.

Umami is salty, not sweet.

It is in foods like smelly fish and cheeses.

Now scientists believe they have found a sixth taste.

Fat is the newest one.

Richard Mattes is a scientist.

He thinks people will work with the taste of fat differently in the kitchen now.

Cooks will make lots of food taste better.

Taste is like color.

Sometimes we put together red, yellow and blue.

We make new colors in different ways.

The same goes for food.

Sometimes we put different foods together.

Then we get different tastes.

Mattes wanted to see if fat could be another taste.

He did a test.

Mattes gave people different liquids.

Each liquid had a different taste.

They were sweet, sour, salty, bitter, umami and fatty.

He asked the people to say what taste each one felt like.

The people knew some of them.

They knew the sweet.

They knew the sour.

The people knew the salty taste, too.

The people in the study did not know what the other three liquids were.

They thought they tasted strange.

Then the scientists tried something else.

They decided to give people only liquids with the three strange tastes.

It became clear then.

The people knew what each strange taste was.

The scientists learned that fat has its own taste.

The fatty taste can be found in many foods.

It is found in hamburgers and other kinds of meat.
