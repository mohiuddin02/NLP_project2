There is a big ugly robot in San Francisco.

It is called Mk II.

It looks really scary.

Mk II might fight a Japanese robot.

One of Mk II's arms is a missile launcher.

The other arm is a cannon.

It could be just showing off.

The robot moves very slowly.

It runs on a lawnmower engine.

Gui Cavalcanti and Matt Oehrlein built Mk II.

They have a company called MegaBots.

There is also a big robot in Japan.

MegaBots asked the builders of the Japanese robot to fight.

They said yes.

Now both sides have to pick a time and place.

MegaBots wants to make robot fighting a sport.

Some gamers have been waiting for this, Gui said.

People like fights and people like technology.

"This is a perfect blend," he said.

Gamers will be happy.

The Japanese robot is named Kuratas.

It is faster and stronger than Mk II.

Kuratas has a machine gun.

Mk II only fires paintballs.

It also needs a driver to keep moving.

Mk II is more like a truck than a robot.

That will change.

Kuratas can fight with its hands.

Mk II uses its guns.

It cannot hit or take a punch, Matt said.

The builders knew Mk II needed to be changed.

Matt and Gui looked for help online.

They asked for money to make their robot better.

They spent almost four months working on Mk II.

Now It can take a punch.

Mk II also moves better.

It will need more power to run some of the things that were added.

The inventors want to start a new sport.

It would be a kind of robot Olympics.

There will be special arenas.

Each country will have a robot army.

No one should worry, Matt and Gui say.

It will just be for sport.

The Mk II is big and slow, Gui says.

It can fall over.

He says it is not really useful for a real army.

In a robot fight, it is different.

Look out, Kuratas.
