Trent Edwards played football in college.

Now he feels like he is playing football again.

Trent is wearing a headset.

It is called a virtual-reality headset.

Virtual reality lets people enter new worlds.

They are not real.

Computers make those worlds.

It can make people feel like they are playing football.

Other times they might feel like they are swimming under water.

They could even be in space.

Trent is standing in a classroom at Stanford University.

What he sees in his headset is shown on a screen.

Trent turns to his right and left.

The crowd is amazed.

It looks and sounds like he is playing football.

The game was exciting.

He almost fell down.

One day all football might be like that.

Players can use it for practice.

They never have to go on a field.

No one gets hurt playing this way.

The idea began at Stanford.

Derek Belch played football there.

In 2005, he was sitting in class.

The teacher talked about how our brains work in virtual reality.

Derek said it would be great for training football players.

A new company was started.

It is called STRIVR Labs.

They make virtual-reality headsets.

Kevin Hogan plays football at Stanford.

He used a STRIVR headset before his last three games.

David Shaw is the football coach.

He coaches Kevin.

David said Kevin makes decisions faster now.

Everything is quicker.

STRIVR can also add crowd noises.

It can show rain.

It can make players think it is day or night.

The technology costs a lot of money.

The NFL can pay for it.

Rich college teams can pay for it.

High school teams will have to wait until it is cheaper.

David thinks it will change football.

Every big football team might soon use it.

With virtual reality, coach David can see what the player sees.

He can see which way the player turns.

It helps in practice.

David said that is really important.

It will make the team better.
