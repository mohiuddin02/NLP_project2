That was the historic rally where the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. gave his famous "I Have a Dream" speech.

That rally, along with other peaceful marches and demonstrations, helped win civil rights for African-Americans.

Now a United States congressman, Lewis describes those years in a comic book series.

His latest, "March: Book Two," takes readers back to the early 1960s when he and other civil rights protesters came under attack.

The 74-year-old Democratic congressman from Georgia said that when he turned the pages, it vividly brought back those days.

At the time, Lewis was in his early 20s.

He remembered the beatings, the dogs and fire hoses turned on children by police.

"The drama of what happened, how it happened — it's so moving to me and so powerful," he said.

"For me to look at some of the drawings, it almost makes me cry."

Lewis said Martin Luther King Jr. got some great preaching advice from his father, who was also a preacher.

He said, "Make it plain, son, make it plain," Lewis said.

"And I think 'March: Book Two' makes it plain and makes it possible for the young to understand, to feel it."

The civil rights era has received attention lately because of the film "Selma."

The move is based on the famous march from Selma, Alabama, to the state capital in Montgomery in 1965.

The march sought the same right to vote for African-Americans in the South as white people.

At the time, very few African-Americans were allowed to vote in Southern states.

During the march, Lewis, one of its leaders, was hit in the head by police.

Lewis' first book was the best-selling "March: Book One," which begins when he was a boy on his parents' farm in Alabama.

It takes his story up to his decision to get involved in nonviolent resistance, which is to peacefully protest an injustice.

In the South, black people were forbidden to sit with white people at restaurant lunch counters.

To show this was wrong, they sat at the counters for white people and refused to move, in an act called sit-ins.

Lewis' second book picks up in 1960.

White Southerners were reacting to the civil rights movement with growing anger and violence.

The book ends with the 1963 March on Washington, which drew more than 200,000 people.

Lewis was one of six organizers of the march, and is the only one still living.

The book also describes the bombing of a church in Birmingham, Alabama, which killed four young African-American girls.

Lewis was first elected to Congress in 1986.

He worked on the books with co-author Andrew Aydin, one of his staff members.

Artist Nate Powell drew the pictures.

Hundreds of schools in 40 states have used the first "March" book.

Aydin and Lewis have kept count of the schools where they've heard from students and teachers.

"Unfortunately, the civil rights movement is barely taught at all," Aydin said.

There is almost no education about nonviolent resistance.

In a 2011 report, the Southern Poverty Law Center found that 16 states didn't require schools to teach about the civil rights movement.

Most states did not do a good job teaching about the time period, according to the report.

Last year, a grand jury decided not to indict, or charge, the white police officer who shot and killed unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.

Soon after, students in Louisiana created a civil rights group inspired by Lewis' first book, Aydin said.

Aydin said the comic series helps young people who are pushing for change.

It teaches them "how nonviolent protests succeeded in the past in pressuring political leaders to act," Aydin said.

Aydin got the idea for the book in 2008, when he worked on Lewis' re-election campaign.

Aydin told staff members he planned to go to a comic book convention after the election ended.

People laughed.

"Don't laugh," Lewis said.

He told them that a comic book in the 1950s called "Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story," had inspired him when he was 17, growing up 50 miles from Montgomery.

Aydin asked Lewis why didn't he write a comic book now.

It sounded ridiculous, Aydin said, "But it was still a good idea."

Both books flash-forward to 2009, when Lewis attended President Barack Obama's first inauguration.

Aydin was there, watching a moment in history that his boss and others helped make possible.

More needs to be done to shine a light on that era, he thought.

A comic book might be the way to do it.
