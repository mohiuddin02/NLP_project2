Almost 35 percent of Americans are obese, or seriously overweight.

Being obese is associated with health problems including heart disease and cancer.

The government is trying to deal with this national epidemic by enacting laws that require restaurants, and other places that serve food, to show the calorie content of items on their menus.

When these laws were first enacted, it was thought that they would lead people to make healthier food choices.

Lawmakers also hoped that by posting calories, it would encourage restaurants to make healthier foods available.

A new study shows that they were half right.

Showing restaurant customers the calorie count of menu items might not lead them to pick healthier foods.

Most consumers are creatures of habit and order pretty much the same thing every time.

But having to tell customers the calorie counts of food they serve may prod restaurants into making healthier foods available.

The study was done by researchers from Johns Hopkins University, the University of Pittsburgh and Harvard Medical School.

They found that when eateries began posting their menu's calories, reduced-calorie offerings soon followed.

The study suggests the help comes from restaurants changing "their menu items instead of consumers changing their behavior."

So, while posting calories may not improve diners' decision-making, it just might limit the damage.

The study examined restaurants over a period from 2012 to 2014.

They found that restaurants that posted calories on their menus averaged 139 fewer calories per item than restaurants without labeling.

Restaurants that moved to calorie posting reduced the calorie content of foods they served.

They reduced the calories of meals already on the menu by an average of 120 calories, and new dishes added to the menus averaged 146 fewer calories than their old standbys.

About 70 percent of fast-food customers say that when they visit a restaurant, they almost always get their "usual" order.

One study found that two years after the calorie content of menu items first started appearing in Seattle chain restaurants, just 1 in 4 customers said they used that information when deciding what to eat.

Roughly 4 in 10 customers said they didn't even notice the new information.

By contrast, "calorie shaming" had led restaurants such as Starbucks and McDonald's to make big changes.

They have reduced calories and fat in some of their most decadent items.

They are also offering more low-calorie options.

For example, the Cheesecake Factory changed several of its dishes to make them healthier and added a "SkinnyLicious" menu that comes in at around 600 calories.

It has been almost a decade since health experts first suggested that making better food choices when eating out was an important part of weight control.

A new law starting in December 2016 will expand the reach of the current law.

Not only restaurants, but also other places that sell food such as movie theaters, bowling alleys and ice cream parlors will have to post calories.

Every day, roughly one-third of all American adults and children eat out.

So scaling back the calorie content of customer favorites could have a real effect, the study's authors said.
