Amaiya Zafar is a young girl in Minnesota who found a sport she loves and wants to practice.

Through the sport, she hopes to learn more about herself and test just how good she can become.

For one, the sport she fell in love with is amateur boxing.

More importantly, she is a 15-year-old Muslim girl who is as religious as she is dedicated.

She wants to wear a hijab under her boxing helmet and uniform.

A hijab is a head covering for Muslim women.

Boxing rules do not allow Amaiya to wear a hijab in matches.

Maybe, the 10th grader thinks, boxing rules should change with the times.

Amaiya said the rules are old fashioned.

"I don't think there's anything wrong with getting them changed."

Amaiya fell hard for boxing two years ago when she saw the boxing ring at a gym.

Her father, Mohammad Zafar, suggested that she take up fencing, a type of sword fighting, but that was not for Amaiya.

"I'll box before I'll fence," she told him.

That was that.

He helped her to understand the sport by showing her videos and teaching her about amateur boxing.

Finally, she stepped into a gym and then into the ring.

"Everyone was like, 'That's Amaiya.

She's the small one,'" she said.

Amaiya's parents, meanwhile, became more and more supportive.

"When she first trained, I came into this as a mom and a nurse," her mother, Sarah O'Keefe-Zafar, said.

A dedicated Amaiya trained for a year before she even fought a practice match.

Over that time, O'Keefe-Zafar said she "watched her go from a timid little girl to a confident young person."

The teen faced opposition from some boys who did not think a girl could box, but eventually they accepted her.

"Now they're my team," she said.

Rules about a hijab are not her only problem.

She now stands 5 feet 1 inch tall and weighs 106 pounds.

She is always, she says, "the small one" at the gym.

There are not a lot of women who box to begin with, let alone those who are about the same height and weight.

Boxers fight opponents who are about the same size.

Opponents must also be within two years of one another.

Then there is always the hijab.

Removing it is not an option for a girl who cares deeply about her religion.

International boxing rules say that she cannot cover her arms or her legs below the knees.

Amaiya would like to wear a long-sleeved shirt and leggings beneath her tank top and shorts.

USA Boxing has asked for a decision on the matter from AIBA, the international boxing organization.

"We have 30,000 amateur boxers in the United States," said Michael Martino, who is in charge of USA Boxing.

"So if you make allowances for one religious group, what if another comes in and says we have a different type of uniform we have to wear?

You have to draw a line someplace."

Jaylani Hussein is in charge of Minnesota's Council on American-Islamic Relations.

He said that USA Boxing made the right move in asking AIBA to decide.

"You know, I think we are looking for an opportunity for this young girl to get a chance to do what all young teenagers" do, Hussein said.

"The only difference is that she's a Muslim."

Amaiya is not the first athlete to fight to wear a hijab during sports.

In 2014, FIFA, the world soccer organization, allowed players to wear religious head coverings during games.

Amaiya takes her training seriously.

"If I'm in a bad mood, emotional or having a bad day," she said, her mother will tell her to go to the gym.

In the meantime, Amaiya is teaching a boxing class at the gym on Saturday mornings.

She has eight students who wear a hijab in the class.
