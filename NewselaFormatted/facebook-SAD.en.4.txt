Blame Facebook if you feel sad.

Your friends may be posting sad messages.

A new study says that people spread their joy on Facebook.

Facebook is a popular social networking website.

People also pass on their sadness.

This may be important.

The world is connected by the Internet.

And millions of people are on Facebook.

Scientists studied more than one billion Facebook posts.

They discovered that when a person wrote a happy post, their friends also wrote happy posts.

When a person wrote a sad or angry post, their friends wrote sad or angry posts.

The feelings were passed along in a chain.

The study was published Wednesday.

"It was actually a very large effect."

said James Fowler.

He is a scientist at the University of California School of Medicine.

He wrote the study.

How do Fowler and other scientists know this?

Weather records, they said.

The scientists found Facebook posts in cities with rain.

They figured out if the posts seemed happy or sad.

Then they compared the rainy-day posts with non-rainy-day posts.

Rain increased the number of sad posts.

Rain also reduced the number of happy posts.

But it didn't end there.

The sad posts made people sad even in cities with dry weather.

The Facebook friends in dry cities began writing sad posts also.

Their feelings spread around the world.

But not everyone agrees with the study.

Russell Lyons teaches math at Indiana University.

He said he hasn't looked closely at the Facebook study.

But he's not convinced by it.

Fowler said Facebook posts can make people healthier.

He said that if happy posts increased on Facebook, a wave of good feeling would spread around the world.
