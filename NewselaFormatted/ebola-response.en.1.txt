To help curb the spread of the deadly virus Ebola, the United States and Britain are sending troops and equipment to West Africa, officials said Monday.

Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that the outbreak is outstripping the ability to respond in one of the worst-hit countries.

The military forces will build treatment facilities in Liberia and Sierra Leone to help care for victims of the virus.

Ebola, which is fatal in 50 percent to 80 percent of the people who get it, has killed more than 2,000 people since it was detected in March.

Thousands more could become infected before the worst Ebola outbreak on record is brought under control, the WHO has warned.

The outbreak began in Guinea and spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Senegal.

In Liberia, the number of new cases is increasing far faster than the number of hospital beds, the WHO said Monday.

As soon as a new care facility opens, it is immediately filled to overflowing.

"When patients are turned away at Ebola treatment centers, they have no choice but to return to their communities and homes," the WHO said in a statement.

There, they inevitably infect others.

Those who care for patients are among those hardest hit by Ebola, which is spread through direct contact with the organs, blood and other fluids of its victims.

In Liberia alone, about 152 health care workers have come down with the virus and 79 have died, according to the WHO.

The country, which is still recovering from years of war, had only about one doctor for every 100,000 people when the outbreak began.

By contrast, the U.S. has about 250 doctors for every 100,000 people, according to the World Bank.

"Every infection or death of a doctor or nurse depletes response capacity significantly," the WHO said.

Humanitarian workers worry that fear of contracting the fever is keeping local and international medical professionals from responding in the numbers needed to contain the outbreak.

Ebola is part of a group of illnesses called viral hemorrhagic fevers, which interfere with the blood's ability to clot.

People with Ebola experience fever, weakness, muscle pain and headaches.

The disease can cause kidney and liver failure, as well as bleeding inside the body.

There is no vaccine or cure.

In neighboring Sierra Leone, a WHO doctor who was working at one Ebola facility tested positive for the virus.

The doctor will be evacuated from the area, the agency announced Monday.

It was the second time that an international health worker sent by the WHO to Sierra Leone had become infected.

President Barack Obama said that the U.S. military will help set up isolation units and equipment for the public health workers arriving in West Africa from around the world.

The units will isolate Ebola victims to keep the disease from spreading.

The troops will establish a 25-bed field hospital in the Liberian capital of Monrovia to care for health workers, Army Colonel Steve Warren, a U.S. Department of Defense spokesman, said Monday.

The military does not plan to be permanently at the facility, which will be turned over to the Liberian government once it has been set up, the Defense Department said in a statement.

But troops will ensure that supplies are maintained at the hospital.

Supplies, such as rubber gloves and mattresses, have been stolen from other Ebola care facilities.

The troops will also provide any support needed to keep the hospital functioning for up to 180 days.

Obama said that the U.S. needs to make the effort now to keep Ebola from spreading through Africa and other parts of the world.

If not, "there's the prospect then that the virus mutates, it becomes more easily transmittable, and then it could be a serious danger to the United States," Obama said.

The British government said Monday that British military engineers and medical experts will build and operate a care facility near the Sierra Leone capital of Freetown.

The care facility will have a total of 62 beds.

Staffed by local and international workers, it will include a 12-bed center providing specialist care for sick health workers.

This will "ensure they can continue to respond to the disease as safely and efficiently as possible," it said in a statement.
