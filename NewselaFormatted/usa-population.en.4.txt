The census is a count that the U.S. government takes of the population.

The population of a state is how many people live in it.

This census showed that states in the South and the West grew the most over the last three years.

Eight out of every 10 new residents in the U.S. were in those areas.

The big census count happens every 10 years.

But every year there is a census estimate.

It looks at where populations are changing.

It includes how many people have died and been born.

It also includes how many people have come into the country, or into the states.

And, it looks at how many have left.

The states that added the most people were Texas, California and Florida.

This helped push the South and West past the Northeast and Midwest in population.

Population numbers are important to states.

Population determines how much money states get from the government.

It also determines the number of seats each state has in a part of Congress.

The number of seats gets changed every 10 years in the House of Representatives.

The states might keep growing this fast until the next big census.

Then Texas could get three more seats in Congress.

Florida, North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado would get one seat each.

Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan would lose a seat each.

States in the South are still growing faster than the Northeast and Midwest.

Texas grew the third fastest.

It was behind only North Dakota and the District of Columbia.

It gained four seats in Congress the last time the seats were changed.

California has 38.33 million people who live in it.

And Texas has 26.45 million.

They are still the states with the highest populations.

New York stayed in third place.

It has 19.65 million people, compared with Florida's 19.55 million.

But Florida will soon be bigger than New York.

Its population is growing about three times faster.

California's population grew faster than the national average over the last year.

It added 332,643 new residents.

But in total, Texas added the most people.

It added 387,397.

More and better-paying Californian jobs might mean faster growth in California.

But Texas still has an advantage.

Its jobs come from oil.

And its population has more young people.

Texas is going to keep an advantage in getting seats in Congress.

But, only until the oil business gets worse again, said Dowell Myers.

He is a professor in California.

"But California's adding jobs more rapidly now than Texas," he said.

So next year he thinks that California will grow a little bit more.

North Dakota is growing faster than any other state.

People move there because of lots of jobs working with oil and gas.

North Dakota's population was 723,393 on July 1.

Kevin Iverson says the biggest population growth has been among 19- to 34-year-olds.

These are mostly people moving there for work.

Iverson runs the North Dakota Census Office.

Population in the District of Columbia also grew fast.

It was the next fastest after North Dakota.

Utah came next.

It was followed by Colorado and Texas.

Those two states grew at the same speed.

Pennsylvania, New Mexico, Vermont and Illinois grew the slowest.

West Virginia and Maine actually lost some people in the last year.

The national population was 316.13 million on July 1.

That was an increase of 2.3 million since the last census.

But the population is growing slower than it did in the mid-2000s.

After that period of high growth, U.S. companies began to cut jobs and people had less money.
