Sari Sakakini opened a new restaurant last year.

He wanted to open Palestinian restaurants around the world.

He does not have much hope.

Sari is a Palestinian.

He lives in Ramallah in the West Bank.

The West Bank is in the Middle East between Israel and Jordan.

Many people have opened up nice restaurants in Ramallah.

They have not done well.

People in the West Bank do not have the money to eat out.

They prefer to eat everyday Palestinian food.

They also do not travel much.

They do not want to try new foods.

Palestinian restaurant owners are frustrated.

Next door in Israel, the story is different.

Food lovers rush to Tel Aviv restaurants.

The city is on Israel's coast.

Last year, a magazine called Israel a great country for eating.

Sari said it is not fair.

Both Palestinians and Israelis eat the same kind of food.

He is right.

Palestinian cooks are popular in Israel.

Nof Atamna-Ismaeel is an Israeli-Palestinian cook.

She won an Israeli cooking contest.

Today she cooks at many Israeli restaurants.

She also writes for Israeli food magazines.

This is a dream for Palestinians living in the West Bank.

Peter Nasir is a Palestinian.

He studied in America.

He loved cooking for his friends.

He returned to Ramallah.

In 2007, he opened a restaurant in his family's house.

It is called Azure.

Peter wanted to serve Palestinian favorites.

He also wanted to serve food from around the world.

He was excited.

His customers were not.

They did not like exciting food.

They only wanted food they knew.

The restaurant was not a success.

He began serving more Palestinian dishes.

He also served hamburgers.

Azure is doing better.

Johnny Goric is a Palestinian chef.

He plans to open a cooking school in Ramallah.

It will teach students how to make Palestinian food.

It will also teach something else.

It will show them how people cook around the world.

Sari is excited.
