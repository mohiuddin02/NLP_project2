ILADELPHIA â€“ Archaeologists have found something amazing.

It is the tomb of a pharaoh.

The pharaoh was a king of Egypt long ago.

The tomb is the room where he was put after he died.

No one knew about this pharaoh before now.

Archaeologists study how people lived a long time ago.

They look for clues buried in the earth.

Bones and old tools are some of the clues they find.

The archaeologists think the pharaoh lived more than 3,600 years ago.

The tomb was found last week.

Sadly, it had been robbed long ago.

But, there was still writing on the walls.

The writing told who was buried there.

The pharaoh's name was Woseribre Senebkay.

Archaeologists expect to find more than 12 other tombs.

They believe the people in them were all in the same family.

Archaeologists already knew there were pharaohs we had forgotten.

A very old list told them this.

The list is known as the Turin King List.

It contains names of Egyptian pharaohs.

Some of the names on it are not well known.

The name Senebkay is on the list.

It was one of the unknown family names.

The names are not on later lists of kings.

This means someone forgot the names long ago.

The tomb is from 1650 B.C.

Woseribre Senebkay was probably around 5 feet 10 inches tall.

He died sometime after age 40.

The tomb held several things: a mask, a coffin, and a wooden box.

The box stored the king's heart and other organs.

Long ago, the Egyptians took out a person's organs before burying them.

Senebkay's tomb is painted with pictures.

The paintings are of goddesses: Nut, Nephthys, Selket and Isis.
