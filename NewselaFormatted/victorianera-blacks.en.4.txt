A large group of old photos was discovered not long ago.

They were found in London, England.

The photos had been stored away for years.

Over time people had forgotten all about them.

All the people in the photos are black.

They lived in England more than 100 years ago.

Now the photos are here in the United States.

They can be seen at the Cooper Gallery of African &amp; African American Art in Massachusetts.

Vera Ingrid Grant heads the Cooper Gallery.

She says the British photos change our ideas about the past.

They show that blacks in Britain lived better lives than many people thought they did.

Most people thought life was very hard for blacks in Britain back then.

They imagined blacks were kept out of sight.

They thought blacks were mostly poor.

The photos show that those ideas are not right.

In fact, many blacks did well.

Some had important jobs.

Some even became rich.

Blacks and whites there got along better than we thought they did.

Most of the pictures are very serious.

They show people dressed up in their best clothes.

A few photos show people fooling around for the camera.

They are just having fun.

The photos were forgotten, said Grant.

The stories that went with them were forgotten too.

The photos are important, she said.

They are something today's Americans should see.

They show that things do not have to be the way they are now, she said.

Life in the U.S. can be very hard for blacks.

Many have trouble being treated well.

White police sometimes act unfairly to blacks.

Grant said the photos change our ideas about the past.

Perhaps they can make us think about the present differently too.

The show could bring about another change as well.

It may make historians look more closely at old, forgotten photos here.

Black life in this country is also recorded in old photos.

Many of those photos have never been studied.

Some could change our ideas about U.S. history.

"What's waiting for us here?"

Grant asked.
