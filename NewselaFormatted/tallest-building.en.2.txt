A group of experts decided that on Tuesday.

They said the building's spire is part of a design that makes it 1,776 feet high and that knocks Chicago's Willis Tower out of the No.

1 spot.

The Chicago-based Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat is the group that made the ruling.

It held news conferences in Chicago and in New York.

The New York announcement came at a building just two blocks from the World Trade Center.

The decision fulfills the vision of the designers of the World Trade Center site.

They wanted to show that New York was not afraid of building an even higher structure in place of the twin towers targeted by terrorists on Sept. 11, 2001.

The 1,776-foot height was aimed at sending a patriotic message about being resilient and getting back up again.

Architect Rick Bell heads the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects.

He said the new building, like the old, illustrates the quest for height.

"Height matters," Bell said.

"There's something special about being high up."

The council was founded in 1969.

It's job is to monitor high-rise construction worldwide and to set rules for what makes a building a skyscraper.

In recent years, designers have become more creative in their construction of the communications antennae that top new skyscrapers.

So the council has had to decide whether those antennae should count toward a building's overall height.

That was the case with the new building in lower Manhattan, One World Trade Center.

It replaced the towers destroyed in the Sept. 11 attacks.

The old towers were 1,368 feet tall.

Questions about the new building's height were raised when architects changed the design last year.

They removed material that was to have enclosed the 408-foot spire sticking out from the top.

"The design changed in a very public way, and that threw everything into question.

It was no longer clearly a piece of the design and it seemed to have sort of been stripped down to the skeleton," Daniel Safarik, of the council, said.

Without the spire, the building is shorter than the Willis Tower, formerly called the Sears Tower.

At 1,451 feet high, the Chicago building became the tallest skyscraper in the United States when it was completed in 1974.

The spire also made One World Trade Center the third highest skyscraper in the world.

It is behind buildings in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and Mecca, Saudi Arabia.

Without the spire, One World Trade Center would have been in 14th place, behind a structure in Shanghai, according to Council lists.
