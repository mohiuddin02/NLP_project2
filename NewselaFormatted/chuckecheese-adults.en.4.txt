Chuck E. Cheese's is for kids.

Now, it also wants to be a restaurant for mom and dad.

The company is making some big changes.

Chuck E. Cheese's is also adding sandwich wraps to its menu.

It is adding food that adults like.

Tom Leverton is the company's boss.

He said if parents have a good time, they will want to bring their children to Chuck E. Cheese's.

As the company's website says, "we're not playing games with our food anymore."

Kids will still be able to play games.

The company might replace game coins with a card.

Kids could use the card to play many games.

Leverton said parents love the new food.

Still, some parents like the pizza at Chuck E. Cheese just the way it is.

Bohmer says she would buy it anywhere.

Zab Herrera and his daughters also like the pepperoni pizza.
