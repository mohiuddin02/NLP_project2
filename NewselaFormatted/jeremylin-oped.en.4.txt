They are surprised at what I tell them.

I was bullied during basketball games.

Sometimes, I was the only Chinese-American player.

Some people made fun of me for it.

It hurt me.

I was also surprised.

I am proud my family came from China.

Why would they make fun of me for it?

In middle school, some of the players on other teams said mean things.

They told me to go back to China.

In college, people called me hurtful names.

During one game, I began to feel rage.

It made me play badly in an important game.

Kenny Blakeney was my coach.

He said people used my race to hurt me.

When I became angry, they won.

Blakeney is black.

He also used to be bullied.

He told me that it made him stronger.

He said I should not let the bullying bother me.

Instead, I could use it to become a better basketball player and a better person.

His story gave me hope.

I cannot stop people from making fun of me.

I can only choose how I feel about myself.

Bullies are cowards.

They try to make themselves more important.

They do this by pushing someone else down.

You might think you should try to be like everyone else.

Do not do it.

Your differences are what make you special.

Many famous people used to be bullied for being different.

Stand up for other people.

Help them find someone to talk to.

My coach made me feel less alone.

It does not matter how old you are.

You can help people feel safe to be themselves.

I am very proud to be a Chinese-American in the NBA.

I did not let the name-calling get to me.

If I did, I would not be able to go to my dream job every day.

I might have lost my temper or given up.

Now, I feel grateful.

I do what love.

I love teaching other players about China.

Most of all, I love encouraging young people.

I tell them to be proud of their own differences.
