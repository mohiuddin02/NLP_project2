These terms bring back  dark memories of war, exile, hunger and death.

The Abdulkerimovs are a Tatar family with deep roots in the Crimea in Ukraine.

Last week's Russian takeover of the Crimean peninsula brought history flooding back.

It reminded many Tatars of the Nazi occupation of Crimea during World War II and after that, the Soviet deportation of the entire Tatar people.

In 1944, Josef Stalin, the head of the Soviet Union, accused the Tatars of being traitors and forcibly uprooted them.

Tatars are an ethnic group that ruled the Crimea until it was conquered by the Russian Empire in 1783.

"If somebody tells me today that another deportation is possible, I would tell him that he is an idiot and nothing of the kind can happen again," said Jafer Abdulkerimov.

He is a frail 81-year-old man with bright eyes, a steady voice and an excellent memory.

"But then again, if somebody had told me ... that another occupation of our land by a foreign army is possible, I would have told him he was an idiot too," Abdulkerimov added.

In February, the Russian army invaded the Crimea after Ukraine's president, who was close to Russia, was overthrown.

A temporary government, which favors Western countries, took over in Kiev, Ukraine's capital.

Few are seriously suggesting that Russia's occupation of Crimea means the Tatars will be deported.

So far, the occupation has not been violent.

But Tatars, who are mostly Muslim, fear Russian nationalists in the region.

The nationalists want Russians to control the region.

The Crimea has a large ethnic Russian population, which is angry about the overthrow of Ukraine's Russian-leaning president, Viktor Yanukovych.

In February, Yanukovych, who was close to Russia, fled the capital.

"As Moscow once again intends to gain control over the (Crimean) peninsula, the Tatars become the most (powerless) people in Crimea," said Mustafa Dzhemilev.

He is a Crimean Tatar activist and member of the Ukrainian parliament.

As with so many groups in this part of the world, the history of Crimean Tatars is filled with violence and tragedy.

In 1783, Russia took over the Crimean Tatars' kingdom.

Over the next half century, more than 600,000 Tatars were forced to leave, said Gulnara Abdulayeva, a Crimean Tatar historian and television anchor.

Abdulkerimov remembers every detail of his family's ordeal during World War II, calling it a trip to hell.

On May 18, 1944, Jafer, his two brothers and his mother were awakened at 5 a.m., along with hundreds of other Tatar families in his village.

They were put into trucks and then a cargo train.

Eventually, they were loaded onto a river barge.

Forced to stay below deck, they only saw daylight when a door was opened to dump a dead woman overboard.

"Women and children were crying and wailing while old men were praying," Abdulkerimov said.

"We all thought they would sink the barge with us in it."

More than 600 of about 5,000 Tatars died during the first two years of exile in frozen Siberia.

Adults were put to work cutting pine trees for timber and children tried to survive on a few ounces of stale bread a day.

Of about 200,000 Crimean Tatars deported in 1944, up to 40 percent died within two years.

Abdulkerimov returned with tens of thousands of other Tatars in 1990.

He built a home in a suburb of Simferol, a major city in Crimea.

He fears that Russian troops and local Russian nationalists will lash out at the Crimean Tatars.

In the Crimea, there are 260,000 Tatars out of a total population of almost 2 million.

Again, there will be deportations, he fears.

Last week, the Crimean parliament appointed a Russian nationalist, Sergei Aksenov, to be its new head of government.

It will hold a vote this month to determine whether Crimea should join Russia.

In December, Aksenov reportedly led a group of Russians who rioted in neighborhoods outside Simferol, where Tatars were building homes.

The Russians destroyed many of the Tatar buildings with sledgehammers.

"Who will prevent them from doing something totally absurd like voting to expel us ... once again?"

Dzhemilev said.

Russian nationalists say that the Tatars want to create a separate Tatar nation.

"The Tatars should watch their step now," said Alexander Zhilkin, a businessman who carried the  Russian flag.

"Now that our people are in power here we won't allow any separatism inside our republic."

A pro-Russian Crimean parliament member said the Tatars are not in danger.

He promised the Tatar community power that "they had never enjoyed before."

But the residents of Abdulkerimov's community patrol the streets at night.

They fear attacks by Russians.

"When they deported my father's and mother's families in 1944, all our grown men were at (war) and couldn't protect them," said Emir Shevkiev.

He belongs to the local Tatar community.

"We are here and we will fight back."
