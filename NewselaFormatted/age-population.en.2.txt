<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/UN_AGING_2050_Edit.jpg" />The world is aging so fast that most countries are not prepared to support their swelling numbers of elderly people, according to a study from the United Nations and an elder rights group.

The report ranks the well-being of elders in 91 countries.

The rankings are based on both economic and social factors.

Sweden comes out on top and Afghanistan is last.

Supporters of the elderly have been warning for years that nations are simply not working quickly enough to cope with a population that is aging faster than ever before.

Now the report backs them up.

By the year 2050, for the first time in history, there will be more people older than 60 than children younger than 15.

Truong Tien Thao runs a small tea shop on the sidewalk near his home in Hanoi, Vietnam.

He is 65 and acutely aware that he, like millions of others, is plunging into old age without a safety net.

He wishes he could retire, but he and his 61-year-old wife depend on the $50 a month they earn from the shop.

So every day, Thao rises early to open the stall at 6 a.m.

He works until 2 p.m. Then his wife takes over until closing.

"People at my age should have a rest, but I still have to work to make our ends meet," he says, while waiting for customers at the shop.

"My wife and I have no pension, no health insurance.

I'm scared of thinking of being sick — I don't know how I can pay for the medical care."

Thao's story reflects a key point in the report: Aging is an issue across the world.

Perhaps surprisingly, the report shows that the fastest aging countries are developing ones, such as Jordan, Laos, Mongolia, Nicaragua and Vietnam.

The number of older people in those countries will more than triple by 2050.

All ranked in the bottom half of the index.

The Global AgeWatch Index (www.globalagewatch.org) was created by elder advocacy group HelpAge International and the U.N. Population Fund.

It was made because there was a lack of international information on the extent and impact of global aging.

The index compiles information from several global agencies.

Income, health, education, employment and age-friendly environment in each country are analyzed.

The index was welcomed by elder rights advocates.

They have long complained that a lack of information has hurt their attempts to raise the issue on government agendas.

"Unless you measure something, it doesn't really exist in the minds of decision-makers," said John Beard of the World Health Organization.

The report shows that aging, and what it means to the world, is growing more complicated.

On the one hand, the fact that people are living longer shows health care and nutrition are getting better.

On the other, many countries still lack basic social protections that provide income, health care and housing for older people.

Afghanistan offers no pension to those not in the government.

Life expectancy is 59 years for men and 61 for women.

The global average is 68 for men and 72 for women, according to the U.N. That leaves Abdul Wasay struggling to survive.

The former cook and blacksmith is 75.

He spends most of his day trying to sell toothbrushes and toothpaste on a busy street corner in Kabul's main market.

The job nets him just $6 a day — barely enough to support his wife.

He can only afford to buy meat twice a month.

The family relies mainly on potatoes and curried vegetables.

"It's difficult because my knees are weak and I can't really stand for a long time," he says.

"But what can I do?

It's even harder in winter, but I can't afford treatment."

Government hospitals are free.

But Wasay complains that they provide little treatment and hardly any medicine.

He wants to stop working in three years, but is not sure his children can support him.

He says many older people cannot find work because they are not strong enough to do day labor, and some resort to begging.

"You have to keep working no matter how old you are — no one is rich enough to stop," he says.

"Life is very difficult."

Wealth in itself does not guarantee protection for the old.

Rising economic powers like Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa rank lower in the index than some poorer countries such as Uruguay and Panama.

However, the report found, wealthy nations are in general better prepared for aging than poorer ones.

Sweden makes the top of the list because of its social support, education and health coverage, followed by Norway, Germany, the Netherlands and Canada.

The United States comes in eighth.

Sweden's health system earns praise from Marianne Blomberg, an 80-year-old Stockholm resident.

"The health care system, for me, has worked extraordinarily well," she says.

"I suffer from atrial fibrillation and from the minute I call emergency until I am discharged, it is absolutely amazing.

I can't complain about anything — even the food is good."

Still, even in an elder-friendly country like Sweden, aging is not without its challenges.

The Swedish government has suggested people continue working beyond 65, a prospect Blomberg cautiously welcomes but warns should not be required.

Blomberg also criticized the nation's finance minister for cutting taxes sharply for working Swedes but only marginally for retirees.

"I go to lectures and museums and the theater and those kinds of things, but I probably have to stop that soon because it gets terribly expensive," she says.

"If you want to be active like me, it is hard.

But to sit home and stare at the walls doesn't cost anything."
