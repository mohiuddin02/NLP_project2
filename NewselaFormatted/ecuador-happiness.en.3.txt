Freddy Ehlers has been a famous person here in Ecuador for many years.

He has been a television star.

He ran for president twice.

Now the 69-year-old is taking on his most difficult job yet.

The government has put him in charge of making the country happier.

In 2013, Ehlers became Ecuador's first State Secretary of Buen Vivir.

The Spanish saying "buen vivir" means "good living" or "well-being."

Ehlers prefers the second translation.

He has 30 people working for him and $2 million a year to spend.

Some people chuckle at the idea of a government office in charge of happiness.

Ehlers sees the work as very serious.

Ehlers thinks people are wrong to spend their lives trying to "live better."

For most people "living better" means having more money and more expensive things.

"The difference between living better and well-being is a matter of life or death," he said.

"If you use the word 'better' it means you're never satisfied with what you have."

Instead, you always want more.

Too many Ecuadoreans try to find happiness through buying expensive things, he said.

Thinking that way makes people unhappy, he insists.

They never have enough.

Countries have a problem too, he said.

They try to grow richer, to build more and more.

All that building is threatening to destroy the planet.

We are polluting the air and poisoning our water.

We must begin thinking differently, Ehlers said.

We must find different ways to be happy.

If we do not change we will end up destroying the Earth.

Ehlers is trying to figure out how to measure happiness.

He wants to be able to track changes in Ecuador's level of happiness.

Ehlers' office has produced a set of half-hour television programs.

They introduce people to the happy lifestyle.

Ehlers has also been trying to make it easier for people to eat healthy foods.

Packaged foods now come with a rating that show how healthy they are.

The healthiest foods come with a green light on them.

The unhealthiest have a red light.

The idea is that if people eat healthier food they start to feel better.

If they feel better, they become happier.

You might think everyone would like the idea of the government trying to make people happier.

In fact, Ehlers has come under attack.

Last week, anti-government protesters demanded his office be closed.

Protest leader Andras Paez said Ecuador's government has become too large and too wasteful.

He called what Ehlers is doing just plain silly.

The idea that a government can tell people how to be happier is stupid, he said.

Ecuador's government gets much of its money from selling oil to other countries.

The price of oil has been dropping, which means the government has less money these days.

Many people think a happiness program is something the government cannot afford.

They think it is a big waste of money.

"All this talk of well-being is a joke to some people," said government expert Oswaldo Moreno.

"For others it's very serious."

Ehlers argues that his department is one of the smallest government departments.

It does not cost the government much.

At the same time, making the country happier is very important, he says.

"We have thousands of friends on Facebook and Twitter but we don't have anyone to hug.

We don't have anyone to touch," Ehlers said.

The modern world can be a hard and lonely place, he added.

"We have to make time to hug people."
