Drew McDonough walked quickly past bags of brown sugar.

He passed tubs of chocolate frosting.

Then he went to his work table.

Drew is 27 years old.

He is quiet and has dark hair.

He works in a bakery.

All day, he puts cakes in boxes.

He stacks them on a cart.

When he is done, he carefully sweeps the floor.

Drew has autism.

Autism is a disability.

People with autism do not have good social skills.

They may have a hard time speaking with people.

Many people with autism do not work.

Businesses often do not want to hire them.

Drew said his job at the bakery is "probably a miracle."

"It feels as happy as can be," he said.

This past summer, Drew and two other men with autism arrived at the bakery.

They learned to measure sugar.

They learned to put cakes in packages.

They worked fast.

Jean Kroll owns the bakery.

It is called Sugar & Spice Extraordinary Sweet Treats.

People tell Jean that she was nice to hire them.

She answers, "Yes it is nice, but it is also a smart thing to do."

Two years ago, Jean moved her bakery.

A group called Have Dreams was next door.

The group helps people with autism.

Jean heard that people with autism need job training.

She and Have Dreams came up with a plan.

On June 24, three men with autism started.

They learned to work almost as fast as regular workers.

Jean offered them jobs.

After the workday ended, Jean stood in the bakery.

"It was a great day.

A really nice, regular day," she said.

Drew is a great worker.

He helped her bakery get bigger, Jean said.

"This is a good business decision," she said.

It was also the right thing to do.
