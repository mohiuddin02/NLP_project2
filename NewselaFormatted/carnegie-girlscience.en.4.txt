Some people are pretty mad at the Carnegie Science Center.

The museum's problems began about a week ago.

It offers many science programs for Boy Scouts.

Classes include robotics and chemistry.

Some people thought the museum only had one class for Girl Scouts.

They wrote angry posts online about it.

The class is called "Science With a Sparkle."

It teaches girls how to mix their own makeup.

"Marie Curie may very well rise from her grave," wrote the blogger Jezebel.

Curie was a famous scientist.

She was the first woman to win the Nobel Prize in physics.

Right now, few women work in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM).

Making science more interesting to girls is very important, another blog said.

The blog is called Wonkette.

It said teaching them about makeup is the wrong way to do that.

The Science Center responded with long posts.

The museum said it actually has more classes for girls.

People just didn't know about them.

The museum had offered more serious programs for Girl Scouts.

But not many girls signed up for them.

Girls were not interested.

They were more interested in sleepovers at the museum.

Science With a Sparkle turned out to be popular.

Linda Ortenzo defended the program.

She runs STEM programs at the museum.

Ortenzo said it teaches real chemistry.

Makeup is a way to get them interested, she said.

Also, she talked about the other programs the museum has for girls.

One is called "Tour Your Future."

It takes girls to different businesses and companies.

Heather Arnet runs the Women &amp; Girls Foundation of Western Pennsylvania.

Arnet was surprised that people got so mad at the museum.

She said it has worked hard to get girls interested in science.

It offers science sleepovers.

It takes girls to visit scientists.

The museum even has a website for girls called CanTEEN.

Arnet said something good did come of this.

More parents are talking about girls and science.

"That's a good thing for everyone," she said.
