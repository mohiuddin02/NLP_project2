Teeth are covered in a thin coating.

It is called enamel.

It is thin but very hard, and it helps make teeth strong.

Scientists have been studying enamel for years.

They have been trying to understand the history of enamel.

They want to know when enamel first appeared in animals.

The scientists also want to know on what body part enamel first appeared.

A group of scientists has finished a new study on the history of enamel.

It says enamel first appeared in scales on the skin of fish a very long time ago.

Many fish have skin covered in small scales.

The scales are a bit like teeth.

Some scales are covered with ganoine.

Ganoine is a hard coating, like enamel.

One fish with ganoine-coated scales is the North American gar.

The new study takes a closer look at ganoine.

The scientists wanted to know if ganoine was really enamel.

They looked at the genes of the gar.

Genes make up DNA.

They are in plants, animals and humans.

They tell different parts of the body how to grow and work.

The genes of the gar showed that ganoine was not just like enamel.

It really was enamel.

The team then looked at records of fish that lived long ago.

They wanted to know how long ganoine has been in fish scales.

They looked at two fishes.

One was the Psarolepis from China.

The other was the Andreolepis from Sweden.

The two fish were alive a very long time ago.

The scientists wanted to know if these fish had enamel in their scales.

They both did.

Neither fish had enamel in their teeth, though.

This shows that enamel most likely did not first appear in teeth.

It probably first appeared in scales.
