The White House has two new heroes.

Their names are Hurricane and Jordan.

Hurricane and Jordan are guard dogs.

They work for the Secret Service.

The Secret Service protects the president and his family.

On Wednesday, the dogs stopped a man from breaking into the White House.

The man jumped over the fence.

The dogs ran over and attacked him.

He tried to fight back.

He kicked the dogs and wrestled with them.

The man's name was Dominic Adesanya.

He was arrested for attacking the dogs.

Then he was taken to the hospital.

He could go to jail for up to 10 years.

Hurricane and Jordan had to go to the animal doctor.

They had bruises from the fight.

The doctor let them go back to work the next day.

The White House held a meeting to speak to reporters.

Everyone wanted to know more about the dogs.

They are becoming stars.

Both dogs are Belgian Malinois.

They can run very fast.

They have lots of energy.

They work hard to protect their home and family.

Jordan is 5 years old.

Hurricane is 6 years old.

They will work until they are about 10 years old.

The dogs are not pets.

They do not play with the president's family dogs.

Hurricane and Jordan spend most of their time training and working.

They always stay with the officer in charge of them.

The Secret Service is very proud of the dogs.

They are also glad to have some good news.

Many people have been upset with the Secret Service lately.

In September, a man with a knife in his pocket climbed over the fence.

He ran into the White House.

The Secret Service was late in stopping him.

The Secret Service did not use any dogs that time.

Some people say it would have helped.

They want the Secret Service to use more guard dogs.

Other people say the president should give Hurricane and Jordan a medal.
