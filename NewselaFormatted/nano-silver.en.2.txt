<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20140221_SILVER.jpg" />CHICAGO â€” Silver has long been known for its ability to kill some of the nasty microbes that can make people sick.

In hospitals, it's used to help burn victims, and to combat germs on medical supplies.

It can even wipe out dangerous "superbugs" that traditional antibiotics cannot fight.

Now, companies are making money off the fear of germs.

They're adding the tiny, powerful bits of silver on cutting boards, underwear, and yoga mats.

They particles are called nanosilver.

They're even on running shirts, socks and and expanding list of other "antibacterial" goods.

Such products are made possible by recent advances in technology that allow manufacturers to create nano-sized silver and include it into various materials.

A nanometer is one-billionth of a meter; a human hair is about 80,000 to 100,000 nanometers wide.

But some scientists and environmental groups say using so much nanosilver may have risks.

No one knows how being exposed to the specks of silver may affect human health or the ecosystem in the long run.

They also worry that silver may lose its power to fight infections if it is used too much.

Bacteria could become more resistant, or basically get used to silver.

That's what has happened with antibiotic drugs and with triclosan, which is added to antibacterial soaps, make-up and other store-bought goods.

"Some humans are quite frightened of bacteria," said Samuel Luoma in a report published by the Pew Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies.

Luoma was a U.S. Geological Survey researcher.

People could over use it, he warned.

Luoma said he's worried about "the explosion of products," which he doesn't think is necessary or even if they work.

"It's important to prove it's worth taking the risk" before it's put into the world.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recently began requiring nanosilver makers to register their products, saying the specks could bring different risks than regular silver.

But others say the agency's process is flawed because it allows the products to be sold in stores several years before safety studies are completed.

Shoppers, meanwhile, often can't tell whether products contain nano-sized silver since nanomaterials aren't required to be labeled.

The use of nanotechnology has gone underground," said Emma Fauss, who in 2008 compiled a list of commercial nanotechnology products for the Pew Project.

"Manufacturers shy away from labeling things in their products unless it's trendy."

People tend to worry that if it's labeled, it could be dangerous.

Silver kills germs when it oxidizes and releases silver ions, which are deadly to bacteria and yeast.

Ancient civilizations used the metal to treat open wounds.

American pioneers tossed silver coins into water storage barrels to keep water fresh.

Nanoparticles of silver can occur naturally, and are more powerful than bigger specks.

Their large surface area relative to their mass increases the number of ions released.

The silver industry says concerns about nanosilver are unnecessary.

They point out that silver has been used effectively as an antibiotic agent and note that it's usually used in very small quantities.

Nanosilver makers also say nano-sized silver has been used for more than a century.

Nanoscale silver products have been safely used in swimming pools since the 1970s, said Rosalind Volpe,  head of the Silver Nanotechnology Working Group.

It's also been used to purify water.

HeiQ is a Swiss company that produces nano-sized silver for medical products.

Its CEO, Carlo Centonze, says nanosilver is the most researched and safest germ-killer on the market.

Some manufacturers also argue that treating textiles with silver nanoparticles is environmentally friendly.

It reduces the need for washing and allows for cleaning at lower temperatures.

It also makes the products more last longer.

Experts agree that humans can safely withstand fairly high doses of silver.

But over the past 10 years, nanoparticles have been manipulated and put in places where silver has never been before.

Some fear the nanoparticles' small size may cause unintended problems in the human body and in nature.

Studies have found that nanosilver and other nanoparticles can spread throughout the body into organs and tissues.

Nanosilver could upset the delicate balance of bacteria in the digestive system, said Marina Quadros of the Virginia Tech Center for Sustainable Nanotechnology.

Silver nanoparticles can kill both good and bad bacteria.

Beyond the possible damage of nanosilver on human health, there are concerns about nanosilver pollution.

Pollution could be in landfills, wastewater treatment plants and industrial areas.

Several lab studies also have found that nanosilver can leach out of products when washed.

Amy Pruden worries what will happen "if we start using tons of silver nanoparticles and a lot more are going down the drain."

There could be effects we have not seen before, Pruden said.

She is  a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech.

Andrew Maynard, head of the University of Michigan Risk Center, said people may be overreacting.

Using nanosilver in a product may make sense if it serves a medical purpose and it works, he said.

Maynard argues that nanosilver should be used as something to help people, not just as a gimmick to sell products.

"We've survived for many years without having antimicrobial shirts and tools."
