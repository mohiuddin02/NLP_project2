The Air Force uses it to attack enemy vehicles on the ground.

But the U.S. military needs to save money.

So the Warthog's flying days may soon be over.

The plane comes from the 1970s.

It has a gun with seven barrels.

The gun is the size of a small car and is in the plane's nose.

The A-10 is known for tearing apart tanks.

It clears the way for troops on the ground with its huge bullets.

But military officials do not like the plane.

The Air Force prefers planes that fight in the air or can drop bombs to an exact location.

The Warthog can only attack ground targets.

The military also has less money than it used to.

So, it would rather spend money on planes that do more than one thing.

The Air Force said that getting rid of the A-10s would save it about $3.5 billion.

Some people in Congress like the A-10.

They took steps to stop the Air Force from getting rid of any more of them until at least 2021.

Last week, 33 lawmakers wrote to top military officers.

They said they were concerned about getting rid of the A-10.

Last month, Senator Kelly Ayotte from New Hampshire blocked the White House's choice of who it wants to lead the Air Force.

She wanted to get answers about the A-10 first.

Then maybe she will let the person start the job.

There's even a Facebook group called Save the A-10.

The group has more than 4,000 supporters.

There will be other battles like the one over the A-10.

The military says it must slash its older weapons.

But the weapons programs support troops.

They also provide thousands of jobs.

The jobs are in many states.

So Congress keeps coming to the rescue.

The Pentagon already has to cut spending by $487 billion over 10 years.

Some in Congress feel there are better places to cut than programs like the A-10.

They mention overnight meetings and air shows.

Or the military could cut jobs at its main office.

Everyone agrees that the A-10 does its job.

They say the plane is one of the best for protecting troops on the ground.

Pilots do that with the powerful Gatling gun.

The A-10 was designed around the gun in the 1970s.

Pilots can shoot 140 rounds of bullets in two seconds.

But the military says the A-10 can only do one job.

It wants planes to do many jobs.

It wants planes that can kill enemies on the ground and fight in the air against other jets.

The Warthog can't fight other planes in the sky.

It's not quiet.

It's not really fast.

The A-10 replacement is the F-35 fighter jet.

The military paid nearly $400 billion for more than 2,400 of those jets.

The idea is to have a plane that could be used by the Air Force, Navy and Marines.

The F-35 certainly can do more than one thing.

That's the problem, said Todd Harrison.

He studies military programs.

Where are spending cuts going to come from, he asked.

Will they come from expensive new weapons that can carry out more missions, or older, simpler weapons?

The F-35 provides 127,000 jobs in 47 states and Puerto Rico.

Someone will be upset if  fewer of the planes are bought, Harrison said.

"There are going to be a lot of angry people in Congress — no matter what," he said.
