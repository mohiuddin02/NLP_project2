Four men got France's top medal on Monday.

The medal is for being very brave.

Three of the men are from the United States.

The other is from Britain.

The men stopped a gunman.

The gunman was onboard a crowded French train.

He shot at some people.

Nobody died in the attack.

The medal is called the Legion of Honor.

The leader of France gave it to the four men.

France's leader is President Francois Hollande.

President Hollande said the men were very, very brave.

The attacker had a gun.

The four men did not.

They had only their hands.

President Hollande gave medals to Spencer Stone and Alek Skarlatos.

They are American soldiers.

Their friend Anthony Sadler is a college student.

He got a medal, too.

All three stopped the gunman as he walked through the train with a rifle.

After the fight began, a British man named Chris Norman jumped in to help.

He got a medal as well.

The medals were awarded at the Elysee Palace.

It is where France's president lives.

The mothers of Spencer and Alek were there.

They felt very proud of their sons.

President Hollande read out the men's names one by one.

Then, he pinned a medal on each man's chest.

Spencer was the most badly hurt of the four men.

On Monday his eye was still bruised.

One of his arms was in a sling.

Spencer said he was asleep when the gunman showed up.

His friend Alek woke him up.

Alek "hit me on the shoulder and said 'Let's go,'" Spencer said.

The French president said the men stopped many people from being killed.

They are all heroes, he said.

The gunman is now in jail.

His name is Ayoub El-Khazzani.

He is 26 years old and from the country of Morocco.

Ayoub said he did not want to kill anyone.

He said he only wanted to rob the train.

Many people do not believe him.
