It is called the minimum wage.

President Barack Obama would like a higher U.S. minimum wage.

He is not going to get that anytime soon, many believe Many states also have their own minimum wages.

Four of the 50 will decide this November whether to increase that amount.

If more people vote yes, the states would each have a higher minimum wage.

So people who want a higher minimum wage are watching those four states.

The reason is that the four states usually vote for Republicans.

Their voters are often against what the president tries to do.

The states are Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota.

Some people hope that winning in four Republican states will change things.

They think it will make it harder for Congress to keep voting no on a higher minimum wage.

The votes will be counted Nov. 4.

There has been a lot of attention on the minimum wage this year.

Earlier this month, fast-food workers across the country skipped work on purpose to go on strike.

They held the strike to get people's attention.

The workers want a $15-per-hour wage.

They call this a "livable" wage.

The current national minimum is $7.25 per hour.

Seattle passed a $15 hourly rate in June.

People in those four states will vote on much smaller increases.

But that doesn't bother Steve Copley.

He leads the group called Give Arkansas a Raise Now.

"Every penny that somebody who is working hard can get helps," Copley said.

People working for a higher minimum wage must be realistic, said Peggy Shorey.

She is with the workers' group AFL-CIO.

The group supports the states in trying to raise the minimum wage.

"Arkansas is not the same as Seattle," she said.

That means a higher paycheck in Arkansas can buy more there than it could in Seattle, where things are more expensive.

The current minimum wage in Arkansas is $6.25 per hour.

An increase in the minimum wage does not just help the lowest-paid workers.

Other workers also would see their pay increase.

All four state proposals would raise pay on Jan. 1.

There are differences in how the increases would work.

The differences have to do with how the cost of living would be measured.

The cost of living looks at prices for things like food, clothes and housing.

The minimum wage in Alaska would be based on prices in Alaska.

South Dakota would raise the minimum wage based on changes to a national measure of the cost of living.

The measure is called the CPI.

Ten states have minimum wages tied to CPI.

Others are set to follow in upcoming years.

Copley said that kind of measure would not have passed in Arkansas.

Arkansas and Nebraska would do something completely different.

The minimum hourly rates would stop at $8.50 in 2017 in Arkansas.

They would stop at $9 per hour in 2016 in Nebraska.

People who do not want the minimum wage raised may have a tough battle in Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota.

Possible voters have been asked about the wage increases.

The results show that more people could vote yes.

Jay Barth is a professor.

He helped with a poll in Arkansas.

He had an idea of why people there are in favor of the raise.

Arkansas is more open to change than other Southern states, he said.
