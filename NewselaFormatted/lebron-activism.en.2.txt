grand jury on Dec. 28 decided not to charge two white Cleveland police officers for killing Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old African-American boy.

Upset about the decision, social justice activists are desperate to keep their fight alive.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/Cleveland_Police_Shoo_Edit.jpg" /> They have turned to the closest thing northeast Ohio has to a superhuman hero: Cleveland Cavaliers basketball player LeBron James, a two-time NBA champion.

Last year, James said the death of Rice showed "how much further we still have to go," according to the website Cleveland.com.

Many in the African-American community feel that police treat them unfairly.

In 2012, James and his Miami Heat teammates put on hoodie sweatshirts in honor of Trayvon Martin.

The 17-year-old unarmed African-American teen was killed in Florida by a Latino man who claimed he was shooting in self-defense.

Martin was wearing a hoodie when he died.

Activists have unleashed a Twitter campaign asking the NBA superstar to sit out the basketball season until the federal Department of Justice (DOJ) "imprisons the murderers of Tamir Rice."

The campaign is using the hashtag #NoJusticeNoLebron.

The DOJ is investigating the November 2014 shooting of Rice, who was carrying a realistic-looking pellet gun when police responded to a 911 call about a "guy with a pistol" in a park.

Some supporters of the campaign point to the success of a similar one against former University of Missouri System President Tim Wolfe.

They are calling it an example of the power of athletes.

Last year, Wolfe resigned after the university's football players went on strike to protest how he handled several racial incidents on campus.

Others supporters of the campaign against the Cleveland police officers posted videos of famous boxer Muhammad Ali.

In 1967, during the Vietnam War, Ali refused to be drafted into the Army.

Ali is a Muslim and said it was against his religion.

At the time, Ali asked, why should he "drop bombs and bullets on brown people in Vietnam."

He said weren't black people at home "treated like dogs and denied simple human rights?"

Ali said that he did not have a personal quarrel with the Viet Cong.

The Viet Cong fought against the United States during the war.

A judge fined Ali $10,000 for evading the draft.

His heavyweight boxing title was taken away from him and he was banned from the sport for three years.

James has not responded to the request not to play.Â  Some activists have suggested that times have changed.

"We wouldn't have to tweet Muhammad Ali," activist Kwame Rose tweeted.

The effort has split Rice supporters on social media, though.

Some have asked whether it is fair to ask James to stop playing.

Sitting out the season might be a powerful symbolic gesture from a famous athlete.

However, it is not a crime.

It also would have no influence on the federal investigation.

The University of Missouri example is a problem as well.

Wolfe decided to resign because of the pressure from football players and other students.

He is just one man.

It would not be as easy to influence a government investigation or a legal decision in the Tamir Rice case.
