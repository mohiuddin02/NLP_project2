If you are older than 30, chances are you have never heard of PewDiePie, Lily Singh and the Fine Bros. With their large followings online, these homegrown YouTube stars are more famous than some Hollywood celebrities.

Despite appearing mostly on YouTube, many of these popular stars have even earned themselves advertising and sponsorship deals.  Though now it is beginning to look like there is a limit on what their stardom can do for YouTube, which is owned by Google.

YouTube has been talking to news organizations and Hollywood studios to purchase streaming rights to TV shows, movies and other content.

The deals would help to increase the popularity of its new subscription service, YouTube Red.

The potential streaming deals, which were first written about by media outlets last week, suggest that the YouTube stars may not be enough to draw people to pay for Red.

YouTube Red is the company's attempt to be competitive with streaming services including Netflix, Hulu and Amazon.

YouTube Red, which launched five weeks ago, is a subscription service that charges $9.99 a month.

Subscribers get access to ad-free YouTube videos, streaming music and exclusive content created by the site's in-house Internet stars.

Experts say the fact that YouTube is exploring adding outside content is a shift in strategy and the move suggests the service may be struggling to entice subscribers to YouTube Red.  "When YouTube first announced Red, it was going to be a place to get exclusives and the best of YouTube stars," said Jim Nail, an analyst for Forrester Research.

"But clearly that's insufficient to justify the $9.99 price."

YouTube declined to comment on the issue.

However, several major TV studios said that they have had initial conversations with YouTube about streaming rights to content.  If YouTube does secure streaming rights to hit television shows and movies, it would be a drastic change from its original plan for the service.  YouTube Chief Business Officer Robert Kyncl said earlier this year that he had no plans to spend heavily to license expensive content like "the NFL or 'Seinfeld.'"

"To us, what is important is we are not doing what everyone else is doing, competing for the same sources of material, the same creative elements," Kyncl said.

Instead, he said, YouTube is looking for people already proven to work well on their platform.

But not doing what everyone else is doing could be risky for YouTube.

The company faces competition, especially as rivals including Netflix, Amazon and HBO have had recent successes with making their own content.

Shows like "Orange Is the New Black," "House of Cards" and "Game of Thrones," which stream on these services, have been very popular.

These programs are aimed at older audience.

YouTube content is more geared toward the average viewer.  PewDiePie, a Swedish YouTube star known for his video-gaming vlogs (video blogs), is a big hit with the younger audience.

This crowd usually watches entertainment online, mostly on hand-held devices such as smartphones or tablets.

The differences in how younger and older audiences watch content could be an obstacle for YouTube Red, said Alan Wolk.

He is an analyst at a media consulting company.  "Most of Red's audience needs to get their parents to pay for the subscription," Wolk said.

A lot of these parents, he said, will ask their kids why they can't just watch the ads and get the content for free.

Netflix and other streaming services have something else that YouTube Red does not.

These companies rely on a large catalog of movies and TV shows that keep subscribers paying month after month.  YouTube has its own advantages, though.

It has a vast global audience and is owned by Google, giving it easy access to money. YouTube already has some of the best streaming technology, making its user experience online smoother than its rivals.

"YouTube has the financial backing of Google," said Jason Ahmad, chief executive of Epoxy, a company that helps promote YouTube content creators.

"They absolutely can make a credible case to win this market.

Whether they're willing to do it is another question."

YouTube users can currently access Hollywood content on the platform.

Recent movies can be rented for $4.99 or bought for less than $20.

The site streamed Sony Pictures' comedy "The Interview" last year after theaters refused to show the film because of security threats made by North Korea, whose supreme leader Kim Jong-un is made fun of in the movie.

Red was built on the idea of making exclusive content with YouTube's homegrown stars, but even those involve partnerships with hit shows.

Among the original content planned for Red was a teaming up of PewDiePie and the creators of "The Walking Dead.

" YouTube also planned a Fine Bros. project called "Sing It!

", which pokes fun at TV shows like "American Idol" and "The Voice."
