New York is looking to turn its old payphones into a city-wide Wi-Fi network.

The network could become the biggest and fastest in any city.  <img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/Payphone-Wi-Fi_Edit_1.jpg"/> At least 7,500 hot spots will be put up.

The first hot spots will go online early this year.

A hot spot provides Internet service over a small area.

New York's hot spots are supposed to give super fast and free Wi-Fi service.

There will also be street phones with free calling and ports to charge cellphones.

New York will make money from the hot spots through the advertisements that will be placed at each one.

Other cities are trying to install public Wi-Fi after older attempts did not work.

New York officials say their project is making the Internet available to everybody.

They say the plan will also make old street phones modern.

For now, the first hot spot is still being tested.

It sits under a gray cover on a sidewalk.

Some passers-by like the idea of what is coming.

When a person uses a cellphone for apps and Web surfing, they use up the data they buy from their cellular company.

Wi-Fi helps to cut how much data they use up and could save money.

Many customers' plans also limit the amount of data they can use.

Some people are worried by the hot spot plan.

They think it is not safe to use public Wi-Fi.

The city has said data will be coded to keep it safe.

Any information gathered for advertisers will protect information about the Wi-Fi user, the city said.

Payphones might seem old fashioned.

After all, more than two-thirds of Americans own smartphones, the Pew Research Center on Internet, Science & Technology says.

There are still about 8,200 payphones on New York streets.

Some were used when other phones did not work after Superstorm Sandy in 2012.

Still, there are fewer of them.

They are not being used as much.

More than one-third of those inspected last year did not even work.

The city experimented with providing Wi-Fi from a few payphones in 2012.

Afterward, it came up with the current plan.

It is called "LinkNYC."

A group of companies will pay the $200 million it costs to install the Wi-Fi network.

In return, the group will get half the money from digital advertising at the hot spots, expected to earn $1 billion over 12 years.

The city will get the other half.

Right now, the city earns about $17 million a year from payphones.

Each hot spot will provide Internet service for about 150 feet in any direction.

The service is supposed to be about 20 times the speed of average home Internet service.

Officials have said the service is meant for outdoor use.

It is not clear whether it might spread enough to work inside some businesses and homes.

Many Americans now carry a smartphone.

The New York Wi-Fi network could help users save on their data plans, said Erik Stallman.

He is a lawyer for the Center for Democracy and Technology, a group that supports Internet rights.

It can also help cellular networks that are being used too much and are running slowly, Stallman said.

Tourists without cell service also could benefit, said John Breyault.

He works at a group that supports the rights of shoppers.

Some people are against LinkNYC.

A payphone company has taken the city to court, saying it is unfair that only the one group can offer the Wi-Fi service.

The city has said it believes the plan is legal.

Many U.S. cities tried to install public Wi-Fi in the early 2000s.

Then more homes got Internet.

Not enough people used the public Wi-Fi and ads did not bring in enough money.

Some Internet service companies complained the city networks made them lose money.

Now some cities are trying again.

Boston is working to add more than 170 hot spots.

Los Angeles is encouraging companies to provide free wireless to all homes and businesses, with outdoor coverage as a goal.
