They have a message for fellow Texans: Please don't blame Liberians for Ebola reaching the United States.

Ebola is a deadly disease.

It kills most people who catch it.

Recently, a Liberian named Thomas Eric Duncan traveled to the Dallas area from West Africa.

In Dallas, he was found to have the deadly disease.

Ebola has killed more than 3,000 people in West Africa.

Since then, some Texans are blaming Liberians in their community.

They whisper things like "Go back to Liberia."

Carolyn Woahloe is a nurse.

She said she got calls from at least two Liberian workers who said people told them they should leave the United States.

The nurse said she told the callers to stay put.

"If I am Liberian, that doesn't mean that I have Ebola," Woahloe said at a news conference.

"This is not a Liberian problem.

This is a world problem."

A group of about 10 community leaders stood together as a sign of solidarity.

Stanley Gaye, president of the Liberian Community Association of Dallas-Fort Worth, spoke to a crowd of reporters.

The reporters had plenty of questions: "Do you know the Ebola patient?"

"Where is the patient's family?"

"Is the community concerned for its image?"

Gaye said the last thing Liberians need is to be blamed as a group.

"We want to work together with the Dallas community and with the people of the Liberian community to get as much information out about this as possible," he said.

Gaye said the Liberian community had met a month ago with U.S. health officials.

They wanted to learn what they could do for relatives suffering with Ebola back home.

Liberia is a poor country.

Health care in Liberia is not very good.

There are very few ambulances.

But the community has not heard from health officials since Duncan was found to have Ebola, Gaye said.

Harling Moore is pastor at New Life Fellowship Church.

He said Liberians have more to worry about than their public image.

They are concerned about their countrymen in Africa who are dying.

"We've been in communication with loved ones back home," he said.

"We're offering advice on how to deal with this disease, and we are sending supplies."

In the church parking lot, officials pointed to a large truck they said was loaded with medical supplies.

It was to be sent to two hospitals in Liberia.

If the borders were closed, they said, aid could not get in.

Don't point a finger at Liberia, said Jimmy Sando.

He is an airport worker.

"This disease has been around since the 1970s.

It ... spread to countries like Nigeria and Liberia.

You can't blame Liberians, just like you can't blame any one nation for AIDS.

That's just fear talking.

Here, there is one case.

Back home, there are many, many cases."

Botchway said pastors in the nine local Liberian churches would spread the word about the disease on Sunday.

They will urge citizens who might have come in contact with Duncan to go to the hospital.

They will tell them to contact health officials.

But Woahloe stressed that people should not even think of returning to their homeland because of mean comments.

One of the women who called her said she had to go home, Woahloe said.

"And I told her, 'Don't go anywhere.

Just go to work.'"
