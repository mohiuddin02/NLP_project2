Along the way, he stopped to accept a pain pill from one nurse.

And a high-five from another.

He has been here for a month.

A Syrian government warplane flying low over his village had dropped a bomb that blew apart his lower limbs.

Both legs had been removed by an overworked doctor in Syria.

The next day, the boy's grandmother took him to the Golan Heights border half an hour away.

There she asked the Israeli soldiers on the other side for help.

The civil war in Syria is still raging after nearly three years of fighting.

For some time now, Israel has been quietly providing aid to some of the wounded.

So far, more than 700 Syrians have received treatment.

The effort was launched by the Israeli army.

It has been praised as a triumph of generosity over politics.

After all, Israel and Syria are bitter enemies that have fought three bloody wars.

"We are saving the lives of our enemies," said Col. Tarif Bader, chief medical officer for the Israel Defense Forces Northern Command.

The 9-year-old boy is one of 17 Syrians being treated at Rebecca Sieff Hospital in Safed, Israel.

The hospital is about 5 miles west of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.

It is roughly 25 miles west of the Syrian war zone.

The stream of wounded Syrians has changed the feel at the hospital.

And it has especially changed the lives of the hospital's Arabic speakers.

A social worker named Fares was in the hospital last February when the first group of Syrian patients arrived.

An Arab Christian, he was asked to interpret.

Since then, he has worked nearly around the clock.

He has served as a counselor and interpreter for more than 300 Syrian patients.

Fares, who is 36, asked to be identified by only his first name.

He fears what might happen to him for treating Syrians.

He was in the emergency room when the 9-year-old, a skinny kid with long eyelashes, was brought in.

The boy cried for two days straight.

He is doing better now.

This is thanks in part to Fares, to whom he has become very attached.

On a recent afternoon at the hospital, the pair sat together on the floor.

With them was one of the boy's cousins, who also lost a leg in the bomb attack.

Fares played along as the two boys repeatedly bounced a red plastic ball off his head.

The kids hung on him as he talked and grabbed at his big hands.

Most of those treated here are men.

They are assumed to be rebels fighting against the Syrian government.

Such fighters can't seek treatment in Syrian government hospitals.

The men are kept together in two rooms guarded by Israeli soldiers.

"They tell me about fighting," Fares said, "and about killing, also."

Israel's border with Syria has been mostly quiet since the end of the 1973 war.

In that war, Syria tried, but failed to take back the Golan Heights.

It had lost this territory to Israel six years earlier.

U.N. soldiers now patrol the eastern border between the Heights and Syria.

On the Israeli-controlled side of the border, everything is peaceful.

Cows graze in pastures and families drive down well-paved streets.

To the east, Syrian government forces loyal to President Bashar Assad battle rebel groups.

Clouds of smoke can be seen from the top of Bental Mountain in the Heights.

And distant explosions can be heard.

Israel has largely remained on the sidelines of the war.

Except, that is, for the medical help it is giving.

The grandmother of the 9-year-old with no legs said she has only gratitude for the Israelis.

In a few days, she and her grandson will be driven to the Golan Heights border.

From there, they will head back into Syria.

The boy has been fitted with two prosthetic limbs — that is, artificial legs.

These were donated by a Muslim citizen of Safed, whom Fares had asked for help.

If all goes well, the boy may be able to walk again.

But he will probably never be able to return to playing soccer, his favorite sport.

When asked what going back will be like, the boy's grandmother threw her hands into the air.

She said she didn't know whether the family had a home to return to.
