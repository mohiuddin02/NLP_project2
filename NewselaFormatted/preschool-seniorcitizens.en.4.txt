The little boy turns to the man sitting next to him.

"Can you open this for me?"

the boy asks.

He gives a bag to the elderly man seated to his right.

"Sure I can, buddy," says David Carriere.

He is 92 years old.

He opens the bag.

The little boy starts stuffing food into the bag.

"He's smart," Carriere says about the boy.

Carriere is an elderly man who lives at a place called "the Mount."

The Mount is a home for older people.

The Mount also has day care for children.

It is different from most day care centers.

At the Mount, children and older people can play and work together.

On one day, some older people and children worked together.

They prepared food for some people.

Other days, the older and younger people sing.

Sometimes they tell stories.

Sometimes they create art.

Charlene Boyd works at the Mount.

She says the older people are happy when they see young people.

She says young people see what it is like to get older.

There are 125 students at the Mount.

They are in day care.

A lot more people want to come there.

It is a very popular place.

Ryan Smith was one of the first young people who went to day care at the Mount.

Now he is 23 years old.

He says the program made him want to help others.

Today, Smith is studying to be a firefighter.

Eileen McCloskey works at the Mount.

She says the older people's "eyes light up" when they see the young people.

"You just step back and let this magic happen," McClosky said.
