Flo is a war dog.

She knows how to find bombs buried in the dirt.

Her sense of smell helps her protect soldiers.

So do her eyes and ears.

Flo spent seven months in a different country.

She helped soldiers fighting in a war.

It was very tough.

Flo had a partner solider called a handler.

His name was Cody Crangle.

He was a Marine.

Flo let Cody know any time she found something bad.

Flo and Cody always walked together.

They stayed in front of their group.

It was their job to find hidden traps.

Flo and Cody protected the other soldiers.

Then Flo and Cody came back to the United States.

Cody wanted to make Flo his pet.

He asked his boss over and over.

Finally, he got to keep her.

One day, Flo and Cody went to the park.

They played fetch.

Flo hurt one of her back legs.

She was limping.

Cody thought maybe she had pulled a muscle.

Cody took Flo to the vet.

He wanted to see if she was OK.

The vet had good news.

Flo's leg was a big problem, but they could fix it.

The vet had bad news, too.

It would cost about $4,000 to fix Flo's leg.

Cody did not have enough money.

That did not stop him.

He would find a way to pay the vet.

Cody had good doctors when he was a solider.

Now he is in college.

He still has good doctors.

The country pays to take care of him.

It does not cost him anything.

Flo had good doctors when she was a war dog.

They took care of her for free.

Now things are different.

Cody has to pay for her to go to the doctor.

The country does not take care of her.

Some people are very upset about that.

They say military dogs are soldiers, too.

A group called War Dogs wants to help.

They paid for some of Flo's bills.

Cody does not want to ask for more help.

He just wants to tell people about Flo's story.

Cody wants to teach people about war dogs like Flo.
