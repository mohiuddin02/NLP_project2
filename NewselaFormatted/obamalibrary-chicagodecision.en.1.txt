In a video, the Obamas said the library will be located on the city's South Side.

No decision has been made yet whether it will be built in Jackson or Washington parks.

"All the strands of my life came together and I really became a man when I moved to Chicago," the president said in the video, which showed him seated with his wife.

"That's where I was able to apply that early idealism to try to work in communities in public service.

That's where I met my wife.

That's where my children were born."

Michelle Obama, who is from Chicago, said she was "thrilled to be able to put this resource in the heart of the neighborhood that means the world to me.

Every value, every memory, every important relationship to me exists in Chicago.

I consider myself a South Sider."

The Barack Obama Foundation, which is in charge of the project, said it would seek out universities, community leaders and organizations as it sketches out plans for the library.

For more than a year, the University of Chicago had been engaged in a fierce competition with Columbia University in New York, the University of Hawaii and the University of Illinois at Chicago.

The University of Chicago has pledged to make resources available for the library.

The foundation said it also plans to work with the three other universities that were finalists.

"The foundation intends to maintain a presence at Columbia University for the purpose of exploring and developing opportunities for a long term association," the foundation said in a statement.

"In addition, the foundation will work with the state of Hawaii to establish a lasting presence in Honolulu," the foundation said.

Although Obama was born in Hawaii, the University of Chicago had long been considered the front-runner.

However, its bid to build the library on the South Side became caught up in a battle over the use of public parkland.

The original plans to announce the library in March were delayed until after the April 7 election for Chicago mayor.

In late April several news organizations, including the Chicago Tribune, reported that Chicago had been selected to host the library.

The decision ends a yearlong competition that began with 13 proposals that eventually were narrowed down to four finalists.

The University of Chicago had long been considered the most likely candidate.

Obama taught constitutional law there for a dozen years and first lady Michelle Obama formerly worked there as a hospital administrator.

Chicago's South Side also is where Obama launched his political career as a state senator in 1996 and where the first lady was born.
