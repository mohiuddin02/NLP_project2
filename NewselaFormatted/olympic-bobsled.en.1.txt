Ice was part of Aja Evans' midsummer day's dream too.

Evans was thinking about how good it would feel to be back on it, how the success from her rookie season as a bobsled pusher still sent chills of excitement through her.

So Evans, in trying to reach her dream of reaching the Olympics, had slogged her way through traffic from her mother's house to the training center.

It was one stop on her path to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.

Evans, 25, went into the gym to begin a workout with her trainer, Jacob Ross.

She was wearing a purple top, black tights, pale turquoise sneakers with purple shoelaces, and a smile that flashed brightly on her face, at least when it was not contorted by effort.

In this session, there would be sets of box squats, in which she eventually lifted 365 pounds; sets of dead lifts up to 195 pounds; and crouching carries of a 40-pound SandBell, a weight that looks sort of like an accordion.

She also would repeat flips of a 400-pound tire; and, most eye-catching of all, box jumps.

Box jumps involve springing forward from a seated position to a stack of pads about 2 feet in front of the seat.

Evans launched her 5-foot-10, 175-pound body to the top of a 4-foot, 3-inch high stack.

Sports success is in her family's DNA.

Her father, Fred, was an NAIA swimming champion for Chicago State — the first black swimmer to win a national title for college athletes.

Her uncle is longtime Major League Baseball player Gary Matthews and her cousin Gary Matthews Jr. has played baseball in the major leagues for 12 years.

"But no one grows up bobsledding in their backyard," Ross said.

Evans' introduction to bobsledding was even more unlikely considering she's from the south and west sides of Chicago.

Like many people, Aja Evans' knowledge of bobsledding had consisted of what she saw in the film "Cool Runnings."

The movie tells the story about even more unlikely bobsledders, from Jamaica.

She learned more about bobsledding during the 2010 Winter Olympics.

Her University of Illinois track coach, Mike Erb, decided to compare Evans' scores in sprinting, jumping and power to those used to test the bobsled athletes.

Erb realized her combination of skills was ideal for a sled pusher and encouraged her to try the sport.

An online search told her about bobsled tests in the summer of 2012.

She went, got the highest score (794 of 800), then stunned everyone by winning the dry-land push trials.

Three months after the combine tests, Evans found herself on ice at the Olympic bobsled track in Lake Placid, New York.

She was about to plunge into the unknown: sitting in the back of a 375-pound sled for about 50 seconds at speeds beyond 70 miles per hour.

Bonny Warner, who has been in the Olympics three times on another kind of sled, the luge, once said, "The ground shakes when a bobsled goes by."

She described steering it as akin to trying to maneuver an overloaded Mack truck.

The bobsleds, she said, "sound like a locomotive in a tunnel and are as smooth and graceful as a drunken elephant."

Experienced bobsledders tried to prepare Evans for what her first run would be like — the noise, the bumps, the shaking, the G-force in the curves.

It was even worse than they said, and Evans initially wondered what she was doing there.

With the encouragement of her mother, Sequocoria Mallory, Evans decided that if she made it through that second run, she would stick with it.

The whole way down, she was thinking, "It's worth it, it's worth it, it's worth it."

Two days later, in the second of four runs of the national team trials for the 2012-13 season, Evans and driver Jamie Greubel set a start record for the Lake Placid track.

"I don't know what I'm doing," Evans said to herself, "but I'm doing pretty good."

By the end of the season, she would be USA Bobsled's rookie of the year, win two World Cup medals and set start records on tracks in Park City, Utah; Koenigsee, Germany; and the 2014 Olympic venue in Sochi, where she and the top U.S. driver, Elana Meyers, also would win a World Cup silver medal.

The push phase of a bobsled race lasts 50 meters of a track that is about 30 times that long.

The driver and pusher, also known as pilot and brakeman, push for 20 or 30 meters, then jump into the sled.

The pusher sits with her head down and tries not to move her upper body, which could move the sled off the line the driver is steering.

The silver medal Evans won in February in her last competition of the season in Sochi was special, and still made her eyes misty when she recounted it six months later.

It is also what convinced Meyers that her brakeman was willing to fight through any adversity in the sport.

Evans' grandfather and constant supporter, Lemorse Mallory, died at 95, six days before the race, and she wanted to be back with her family in Chicago.

Evans' mother persuaded her to stay, that her grandfather would have wanted her to compete.

"Battling all those emotions and doing as well as I did made me so much more excited to return this season," Evans said.

"I feel like I have gotten through the hard part, and now it's a victory lap."
