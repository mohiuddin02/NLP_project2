The pictures were probably created by Warhol on computer disks nearly 30 years ago.

The disks, however, were nearly unreadable.

That's where a group of Carnegie Mellon University students came in.

The students discovered how to get Warhol's pictures from the old disks into a modern computer.

It will take some time before their value is clear.

But already the new art has excited Warhol fans around the world.

That's understandable for one of the world's most famous artists.

"It's something that's new," said Matt Wrbican.

He is an expert on Warhol at the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh.

"And that doesn't happen very often with Warhol."

The whole story was revealed Thursday morning.

Three groups had a hand in the discovery.

They are the Andy Warhol Museum, Carnegie Mellon University and the Carnegie Museum of Art.

Warhol once predicted  that "everyone would be world-famous for 15 minutes."

The Pittsburgh-born artist died in 1987.

He is still famous as the King of Pop Art.

Warhol's paintings can now cost more than $100 million.

The museum knew it had Warhol's Amiga computer and floppy disks for some time, Wrbican said.

Floppy disks were computer devices that stored information.

They have been replaced by CDs.

Wrbican said he had wanted to look through Warhol's computer and disks for a while.

But he didn't have the time.

It took a modern artist to finally get the ball rolling.

In 2011, New York City artist Cory Arcangel was doing a show at the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh.

Arcangel is a big Warhol fan.

He was asked if he had any ideas for an artwork about Pittsburgh.

The video shows Warhol "painting" on an Amiga computer.

Arcangel tried to find someone who knew a lot about old computers.

It turns out that Carnegie Mellen had an active Computer Club.

The club was interested in old computer technology and how it developed.

The club wasn't very hopeful that anything interesting was on the disks, said Keith Bare.

He is a Carnegie Mellon graduate.

The disks were really old.

No one knew what was on them.

They didn't have "something handwritten on them like 'Andy Warhol's images' on them," Bare said.

First, the students created their own computer program.

Using their program and another one, the team managed to pull the images from the disk.

The pictures included Warhol's version of "The Birth of Venus" by artist Sandro Botticelli.

Botticelli painted during the 1400s.

They also included a Warhol self-portrait, and a Campbell's soup can.

Warhol was known for drawing and painting soup cans.

Within hours of the announcement, Wrbican got a call.

It was from someone who didn't think Warhol created the images.

The caller had worked at Amiga World magazine.

The man said he didn't think Warhol made a lot of those images.

The magazine published a story in 1986 about Warhol and his Amiga computer.

But it doesn't matter if Warhol had help.

The pictures would still help to understand him as an artist, Wrbican said.

A lot of Warhol's art was created with other people, Wrbican said.

Even if Warhol created the images all by himself, he noted, "We're not calling these artwork.

It was just Warhol learning a new tool."

People might think the museum could sell the Warhol images for a lot of money.

But even if Warhol made them, it won't be easy for the museum to make money.

Warhol often used popular pictures or products like the Campbell's soup cans in his work.

Other people or companies may own the rights to the pictures.

That means they can't be used without permission.

"We don't really see them as Warhol's artwork," Wrbican said.

"So I don't think we're going to be putting them out there on coffee cups to sell any time soon."
