The pope beat out National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden for the honor.

Snowden gave away secrets of the United States' secret spying programs.

Pope Francis used to be a Cardinal in Argentina.

His name was Jorge Mario Bergoglio.

He was elected Pope in March.

Francis was the first pope from Latin America.

He was also the first Jesuit to be elected pope.

He has spoken against the world's worshipping of money.

He also says it is an embarrassment that nearly 1 billion people today go hungry.

Tens of thousands of people come out to see him.

He also has more than 10 million followers on his Twitter online account.

The Catholic Church is one of the world's largest organizations.

In a short time.

the pope has changed the way the church acts and how people see the church, said Nancy Gibbs.

She is Time's managing editor.

That made him stand out, Gibbs said.

The Vatican said the honor wasn't surprising.

The Vatican is the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church.

It pointed out the impact that Pope Francis has had with the general public.

The pope is not looking for fame or honors, said the Rev.

Federico Lombardi.

Lombardi speaks for the Vatican on public issues.

But if being chosen Person of the Year helps the pope spread "a message of God's love for everyone," that will make the pope happy, Lombardi said.

It was the third time a Catholic pope had been Time's selection.

John Paul II was selected in 1994.

John XXIII was chosen in 1962.

Padre Toto is one of the many priests to the poor that the pope supported for years when he was archbishop of Buenos Aires.

Toto praised Time's choice.

"Hopefully his way of being will catch on with other political leaders, business executives, sports figures.

His leadership is inspiring," Toto said.

President Barack Obama was Time's selection for 2012.
