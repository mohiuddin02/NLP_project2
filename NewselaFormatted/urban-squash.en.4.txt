Sakora Miller remembers feeling confused.

A group of strangers had offered to teach her gym class a sport.

Everyone already knew how to play basketball.

What else is there?

"They were like, (it's) squash," Miller said.

Squash is played with a racquet, like tennis.

"And I was like, I'm not learning that.

It's not for me."

Miller turned out to be pretty good at it.

She just got a job full-time at the after-school squash program.

It called SquashSmarts.

Poor areas are not the usual place to find squash.

People think it's only for the rich.

Yet, SquashSmarts uses the game to help poor students.

There are 15 city squash clubs around the country.

There are not many students but interest is growing.

There are only about 1,400 city students who belong to squash clubs.

They get free help in school.

They also get to travel.

Around the world, squash is a just regular game.

It's played by millions of people in about 185 countries.

In the U.S., the sport took a different path.

Here, squash is played mostly by rich people in private clubs.

But squash is not just for the rich.

The first city squash program started in Boston in 1995.

The program mixed fitness with tutoring.

Its goal was to keep students from leaving school.

Over the next 10 years, the idea spread.

In Philadelphia, about 120 students belong to SquashSmarts.

They are in the fifth through 12th grades.

SquashSmarts finds its players in public schools.

Most students still don't know much about squash.

But SquashSmarts gains new players all the same.

Joshua Smith is 13.

He wasn't very excited when SquashSmarts workers visited his school.

His first thought was, "What is squash?

That's stupid."

"And then I tried it," Smith said, "and I love it now."

SquashSmarts keeps track of players' heart health and grades.

Many kids in the area don't finish school.

But everyone who stayed in the club for seven years has graduated.

They all have gotten into college, said Stephen Gregg.

He runs SquashSmarts.

Sakora Miller brings the program full circle, he said.

Miller is now 23.

She is finishing her studies at a college called Penn State.

She is the first player from the program to get a job with SquashSmarts.

She shows that change is possible, Gregg said.
