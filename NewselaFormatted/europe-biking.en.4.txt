Winter in Berlin is cold and dark.

Berlin is a city in Germany. The sun is only up for about seven hours.

Still, many people bike to work.

Marion Gisske is 55 years old.

She bikes to work almost every day.

She even bikes in the winter.

"To come home on the bike is to relax," Marion said.

"The trains are packed.

The bike is perfect."

Many cities in Europe want people to bike.

Europe is a continent, like North America.

The United States is a country on the North American continent.

Berlin and Copenhagen are cities in Europe.

Many European cities want people to drive less.

Berlin spent much money last year on roads.

Berlin leaders want to make the roads better for bikes. Bike lanes and bike traffic lights can make biking easier. Berlin has a goal to get to in four years. The goal is that one in every five trips will be by bike. The city wants fewer people to drive.

People in the U.S. might think this goal is hard.

Europe already has many bikers.

People in other European cities think Berlin is already way behind.

Copenhagen is a city in the country of Denmark.

It is also a European city.

In the year 2012 in Copenhagen, about two out of five people biked.

Now, about three out of every five people bike.

It is a big jump in the number of bikers.

Stefan Goessling is a professor in Sweden.

Sweden is a country in Europe.

Stefan studied the cost of biking and driving.

He did a research study in Copenhagen.

He learned that driving costs more than biking.

Biking a mile costs 14 cents.

Driving a mile costs 88 cents.

Stefan said biking is better for the city.

Driving costs more because it requires fixing roads.

Biking will save cities more money.

Stefan's study only looked at Copenhagen.

He thinks the results can help many other cities. He thinks people in the U.S. should try to bike more.

Biking will help people's health, Stefan said.
