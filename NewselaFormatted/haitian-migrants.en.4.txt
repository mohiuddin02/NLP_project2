Eragene Moncher is from Haiti, a country in the Caribbean near Florida.

Haiti shares the same island with the Dominican Republic.

Moncher has lived next door in the Dominican Republic for a long time.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/Caribbean_general_map.png" /> Now he is going back home to Haiti.

He does not really want to go.

He feels like he has no choice.

He cannot get papers for his children to stay.

They were born in the Dominican Republic.

Haiti is a very poor country.

For many years, Haitians have crossed into the Dominican Republic.

They take low-paying jobs in farming and building.

They have also been treated unfairly.

Their skin color is darker than the Dominicans.

There are more than 500,000 Haitians in the country.

The Dominican government said some Haitians could stay in the country.

They were given one year to ask for permission.

The Dominican government did not make it easy for them.

They had to find seven neighbors to say they were in the country before October 2011.

The government also charged a lot for important papers like birth certificates.

The birth certificates prove people are born in the Dominican Republic.

Many people had trouble getting the right papers.

Moncher was one of those people.

Now many of the Haitians are leaving.

They are scared the government will put them on buses and force them to leave.

Pedro Cano is with a group helping the Haitians.

He said the Haitians are very upset.

They have spent years in the Dominican Republic.

Some have spent their entire lives there.

It would be terrible to force them to leave, he said.

They would lose the few belongings they worked hard to get.

Other countries are blaming the Dominican government.

They say it is treating Haitians badly because of their skin color.

Moncher is very worried.

He does not know how he will make a living in Haiti.

He said he plans to stay with a sister.

He hopes his family can help him find work there.

It will be hard, though.

More than half of the people in Haiti live on less than $2 a day.
