An important new study has found a big change in religion in America.

The country is becoming less Christian.

The number of Christians in the U.S. has gone down in the past eight years.

This has probably never happened before.

Christianity is still the biggest religion in the United States.

Still, there are fewer people who say they follow the religion.

Meanwhile, a lot more Americans say they do not follow any religion, the study said.

The study came from a group called the Pew Research Center.

Younger people are less likely to call themselves Christian.

Only about half of Americans from ages 18 to 33 do.

The number of people who say they follow Christianity will probably keep going down, the study said.

About 8 in 10 people who were born in 1964 or before call themselves Christian.

Also, younger Americans are becoming less religious as they become parents.

This is a change.

People used to become more religious when they became parents.

The study could also tell us something about politics.

Whether a person goes to religious services regularly is a good way of figuring out how they will vote.

So these changes could be bad for political groups like the Republican Party.

Traditional Christian religions and the Republican Party are strongly linked.

Some traditional religions do not allow same-sex marriage.

Some people may not like how religions treat these issues, said Phil Zuckerman.

That may make the people become less religious, he said.

Zuckerman is a college professor.

He studies how groups of people behave.

More people are leaving the religion they grew up in.

Almost 1 in 5 American adults were raised in a religion but are now not religious, the study found.

One leading religious person thinks people leaving a religion is a good thing.

Some people used to pretend they were Christian, said Russell Moore.

Now they are being more honest about what they believe, Moore said.

He is an important person in the Southern Baptist church, a Christian group.

Churches should not become less strict to try attract more people, he said.

The Pew survey questioned about 35,000 U.S. adults.

It was conducted last summer.

Married people are more likely to belong to a religion than single people.

But both groups have become less religious in recent years, the report said.

About 173 million adult Americans call themselves Christian.

That is about 7 out of every 10 people in the country.

The number was 178 million in 2007, or almost 8 in 10 people.

Judaism remains the largest non-Christian religion in the United States.

Still, only about 2 out of every 100 people in the U.S. consider themselves Jewish.

Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism each have about 1 out of every 100 people in the U.S.

However, the Muslim and Hindu populations have both grown rapidly.

The increase comes from people moving to the U.S. from Asia.
