Fifty years ago this week, Martin Luther King Jr. won the Nobel Peace Prize.

The prize is given to people who help stop fighting and create peace.

When King won the prize, he was surprised.

He later said he thought he was dreaming.

It was October 1964.

"It was a shock," said Andrew Young.

He is a civil rights leader and was one of King's closest friends.

King was 35 years old when he won.

He became the second black American to win the peace prize and the youngest.

King fought for black people to be treated equally.

At the time, black children could not go to school with white children.

It was against the law for blacks and whites to sit and eat together in public.

The prize was not important just for King.

It was also important for the city of Atlanta.

Some say it changed the city.

Atlanta celebrated King's Nobel win with a huge dinner.

It brought black people and people white together.

The dinner became the first time blacks and whites shared a meal in public.

A dinner in King's honor may seem like a little thing.

Yet, it almost did not happen.

Many people, both black and white, wanted to make Atlanta a more fair city.

The dinner tested their courage.

After King won, the question was how to honor him.

The problem was that in Atlanta, the races did not mix.

King was black.

Young thought both blacks and whites should be invited to the dinner.

A date was set and the dinner was announced.

But nobody bought tickets.

At the time, J. Paul Austin was the head of the Coca Cola Company, which is in Atlanta.

He said it was embarrassing.

Coca-Cola should not be in a city that refused to honor its Nobel Prize winner.

He threatened to move the company to another city.

Two hours later, every ticket was sold.

On the night of Jan. 27, 1965, about 1,500 people packed the Atlanta hotel to greet King.

Both black and whites attended the dinner.

"It was a turning point, without question," said Samuel Dubois Cook.

He was college friend of King.
