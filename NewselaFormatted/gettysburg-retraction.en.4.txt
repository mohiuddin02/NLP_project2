We know it as a great speech now.

But back then, a Pennsylvania newspaper called the speech "silly."

This week, the newspaper said it was sorry.

Harrisburg's Patriot-News printed an apology.

It said the review of the speech was wrong.

It said the article showed too much pride.

It didn't think about how the speech would go down in history.

The newspaper's apology got national attention.

The editors back then called President Lincoln's words "silly remarks."

They said the speech deserved to be forgotten.

Instead, the speech is remembered today.

One of five copies of Lincoln's handwritten speech is on display at Cornell University.

It is being shown to celebrate Lincoln giving the address on Nov. 19, 1863.

"He was a very thoughtful writer, and it shows," said Michele Hamill.

She works at Cornell.

She pointed to the penmanship and the words Lincoln chose.

The speech was short.

It took about two minutes.

But it is something to remember.

The people who run the newpaper today made their apology Thursday.

There was also an article explaining the decision to apologize.

This isn't the first time a newspaper has apologized many years later.

In 2004, the Lexington Herald-Leader in Kentucky apologized for not writing about the fight for civil rights in the 1960s.

The Meridian Star in Mississippi printed an apology for the same thing.

It ran the apology when Barack Obama became president in 2009.

Five copies of Lincoln's speech exist.

Two are in the Library of Congress.

One is in the White House, one is at the Illinois State Historical Library and one is at Cornell.

All are written in Lincoln's neat penmanship.

The Patriot-Union said "the time was ripe" to clear the air.

Lincoln made his famous speech exactly 150 years ago Tuesday.
