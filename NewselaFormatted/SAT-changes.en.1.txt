Students taking the SAT college entrance exam will no longer be required to write an essay as of 2016, the College Board announced Wednesday.

The change is part of an overhaul to the test.

However, an essay-writing section still will be offered, and many colleges may demand that applicants take it and submit the score.

The main SAT will be condensed to two sections from the current three.

The top score possible will be 1,600 which it was for many decades.

The present 2,400-point maximum was introduced with the start of the required essay seven years ago.

The new optional essay test will be graded separately, said officials of the College Board, which owns the widely used exam.

Those shifts, officials said, are part of wider effort to make the exam better reflect what students learn in high school and will need in college.

It is also meant to minimize the advantages students may gain from expensive private tutoring.

For example, the revised sections in reading will drop their most obscure vocabulary words and instead "focus on words students will use over and over again," said College Board President David Coleman.

The math problems will be less theoretical and more linked to real-life questions.

"While we build on the best of the past, we commit today that the redesigned SAT will be more focused and useful, more clear and open than ever before," Coleman said.

Test sponsors long had argued that coaching does not help students significantly.

But Coleman acknowledged that many people believe students who can afford tutoring have an advantage.

To help address that issue, the College Board is starting a partnership with the online Khan Academy to offer a free series of practice exams and videos about good test-taking practices.

The Silicon Valley, Calif.-based Khan Academy has become one of the most popular online-education sites.

Analysts said the steps arise from both the College Board's self-interest and public interest.

Two years ago, the rival ACT — which most colleges also accept — surpassed the SAT in the number of test takers across the nation.

About 1.6 million students took the SAT last year, while more than 1.7 million took the ACT.

Some take both as insurance.

In some ways, the new SAT will become more like the ACT, which has an optional writing section that many colleges require.

The SAT also will switch to the ACT model of grading, in which only correct answers are counted.

The SAT has deducted points for wrong answers.

The College Board has faced criticism for many years that the SAT is not fair to some low-income and minority students.

Critics also argue that high school grades are a much better predictor of how well an applicant will do in college.

As a result, some colleges have eliminated the need for any exam at all.

The new exam appears to be a more populist version, and more connected to the new federal [Common Core](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Common%20Core) teaching standards, which test critical thinking and close reading.

And if students decide to skip the essay, they will take a less time-consuming exam: three hours instead of the current three hours and 45 minutes.

The dropping of the essay requirement will pose a difficult choice for many colleges, especially for the University of California system, the single-largest customer of the SAT.

UC administrators 10 years ago pushed and won a previous set of reforms in the SAT.

The addition of the essay was one of them.

Stephen Handel, the UC system's associate vice president for undergraduate admissions, said it was too soon to say whether UC will continue to require the essay.

But he and other UC administrators noted that the system's application requires essays.

The SAT writing sample is just one part of a much wider portfolio of grades and personal achievements.

The SAT essay, he said, "has a place, but a limited place."

Coleman said Wednesday that college admissions officers were divided over the value of the essay in helping to choose a freshman class.

The new optional essay will be more closely linked to the texts presented to students.

The essay will require more analysis based on evidence and citations to material in the question prompt and less riffing on personal opinions and possibly untruthful narratives, officials said.

However, some experts said making the essay optional sends a bad and perplexing message.

"I'm not sure it is a good signal to kids in schools about the importance of writing," said Katy Murphy, president of the National Association for College Admission Counseling.

The change also will confuse high school seniors who may be unsure how to fulfill testing requirements that will vary among different colleges, said Murphy.

In one area, the College Board will be making it potentially more difficult for students.

Now test takers are allowed to use calculators throughout the math questions.

But starting in two years, calculators will be banned during some of the math testing to better judge students' "understanding, fluency and technique," the announcement said.

Another change will be that the SAT will start to be offered online as well as in the traditional paper form.
