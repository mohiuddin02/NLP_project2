Many people want to make their brains work better.

They want to keep their brains young.

They want to remember things.

Some companies are making computer games they say will help people's brains.

Not everyone thinks the computer games will work.

Two companies say they will do large tests of their computer games.

They want to see if the games will help children with ADHD.

These children struggle with paying attention.

They also struggle with controlling themselves.

Many children around the world have ADHD.

If the companies want to sell their games, something must happen first.

A government group called the FDA must say it is OK.

The FDA is responsible for food and medicine.

The FDA wants to make sure the games work.

Then it will approve them.

The first company did a small study of its video game.

It showed that the game helped some children with ADHD.

When children play the game, they must think quickly.

At the same time, they must do things with their hands.

This helps the brain remember things and pay attention.

That is why scientists say the game might help children with ADHD.

Children who played the game did not get bored with it.

It did not make anyone feel sick.

Some video games can make people sick to their stomach.

The game helped kids with ADHD pay attention and control themselves.

Some doctors are not sure the game will work as well in real life.

The company plans to study it more.

They will test it on people with different brain problems.

A second company made a different computer game to help people with ADHD.

The goal of the game is to help people who are easily distracted.

The company completed a small study.

It showed that the game was helpful to kids with ADHD.

The results were very much like they were in the first study.

Both companies will test their games more.

They will use larger groups of kids.

Then they may know how much the games really help.
