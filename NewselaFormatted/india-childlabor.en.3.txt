The young workers are hunched over in the poorly lit factory, making cardboard boxes.

Their small hands move fast.

They only pause to wipe the sweat from their foreheads.

Stacks of boxes tower over the small workers.

Many of them are not even teenagers yet.

Still, these working children fill the factories and warehouses in Surat, a city in western India.

The city is known for its factories.

Millions of children in India work even though there are laws saying they need to stay in school until they are 14 years old.

There are 50,000 child workers just in Surat, human rights groups say.

The Indian government has said it wants to end child labor.

The government has suggested changes to child-labor laws, but some people do not like the changes.

The changes would allow children younger than 14 to work in certain situations.

They could work in a family business that is not too dangerous.

Still, groups fighting for children's rights say the new rules could push more children into the workplace.

Children who work find it harder to go to school.

They are also in danger of being exploited, or taken advantage of, by greedy bosses.

The new rules ban children from extremely dangerous jobs like making fireworks or working in a factory that makes heavy equipment.

Still, the rules allow children to work in almost any other industry.

The only requirements are that children work for a relative and after school.

The Indian government is trying to find a balance, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.

Education is important for children but India is still a developing country.

Sometimes families need children to work to survive.

In many poor Indian families, boys and girls help their parents from a young age.

Banning all child labor could hurt small farmers, shopkeepers and others who need their children's help.

According to national numbers in India, the number of child workers in India has fallen over the last 10 years.

There were 12.6 million in 2001, and 4.3 million in 2011.

Still, many children who work for family businesses may not be counted.

Activists in India who fight for children's rights have concerns about the new rules.

They say the rules create a new way to get around the law.

Business owners could hire children younger than 14 by calling them "family."

That is what happens in Surat.

In textile factories where cloth and clothes are made, bosses tell inspectors that the boys working there are their relatives.

Government surveys show that many child workers in Surat have come from poorer areas.

These poor child workers usually agree with whatever the boss says.

The inspectors may not have the time or the ability to find out the truth.

"Family business sounds good," said Chandrashekhar Deshmukh, who works for children's rights in Surat.

But "bosses say, 'I'm his uncle' or 'he's my son.'"

The new rules might actually increase the number of child workers, Deshmukh said.

These new rules still must pass both houses of Parliament in India.

Experts say they have a good chance of becoming law.

A union, a group that supports workers, likes the new changes.

Worldwide rules say that children are not allowed to work until they are 14 years old, the union said.

Work that can be harmful to children is also not allowed.

India's new rules would punish bosses who break child-labor laws.

They could now face two years in prison and an $800 fine.

The changes would also stop punishing parents who only break the rules once.

Experts say children must have time to study and play outside of school.

Too much work can hurt children while they are growing up.

Children who work are more likely to drop out of school.

Farmwork can hurt children, too.

It forces children to work near dangerous pesticides, sprays that kill bugs.

In Surat, children making clothes can earn as little as $1.50 a day.

Some people still do not like the rule changes.

India has been trying to get more companies in other countries to buy things made in India.

There is the feeling that if children cannot work, it could hurt Indian companies, said Prabhat Kumar.

He works for a charity called Save the Children.

"But if you really look at the issue, this won't be the case," Kumar said.

No one wants to buy things that are made by children, he said.
