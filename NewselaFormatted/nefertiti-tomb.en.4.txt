Nefertiti was a beautiful Egyptian queen.

She lived long, long ago.

Nefertiti died almost 3,400 years ago.

She is still remembered even today.

One thing about Nefertiti has puzzled scientists.

They do not know where she is buried.

Nefertiti belonged to the family of King Tut.

Some believe she was Tut's mother.

Now, there is big news.

Scientist Nicholas Reeves says he knows where she is.

Nicholas says Nefertiti is buried right near Tut.

He is in the Valley of the Kings in Eqypt.

King Tut is buried in underground rooms.

These rooms are called tombs.

Nicholas looked over Tut's tomb very carefully.

He says he found two secret doors.

The doors were painted over.

They are not easy to see.

Nicholas thinks the doors open into secret rooms.

He thinks Nefertiti is buried in one of them.

So far scientists have not opened the doors.

They are not sure there really are any doors.

"If I'm wrong, I'm wrong," Nicholas said.

Still, he thinks he is right.

If Nefertiti really is there, scientists will be very excited.

The queen was very beautiful.

She ruled Egypt together with King Akhenaten.

She may have ruled alone after he died.

Nefertiti must have a tomb fit for a queen.

It must be filled with many beautiful and important things.

Now she may at last be found.
