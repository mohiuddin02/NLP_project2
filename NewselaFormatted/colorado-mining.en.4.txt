The Gold King was a gold mine in Colorado.

It closed almost 100 years ago.

On August 5, a team was looking at it.

Suddenly, orange water began pouring out.

The water was filled with dangerous chemicals.

Miners used them to dig out the gold.

A great amount of water poured into a tiny creek.

From there, it filled the Animas River.

The river is in Colorado.

Officials warned people to stay out of the water.

They also cut off water to farms.

The government is looking into what caused the spill.

The problems started long ago.

Two mines may be connected underground.

One mine is the Gold King.

The other mine is called the Sunnyside.

The water could have come from either mine.

The Sunnyside mine closed in 1991.

Company officials closed the hole with a big plug.

The hole was the size of a train car.

The Gold King was also closed with a plug.

Now, the mine owners blame each other for the spill.

They also both blame the government.

Todd Hennis owns the Gold King Mine.

He said the spill is Sunnyside's fault.

He said the Sunnyside owner knew the spill was going to happen.

Sunnyside did not do anything.

It did not want to pay to fix the problem.

Fixing the problem would have been expensive.

Kinross Gold Corp. owns the Sunnyside mine.

The company said it did not cause the spill.

No one has been in the closed mines.

Mining experts do not know if the mines are connected.

Over time, they may have joined together.

Since the spill, people are complaining about the government.

They say it ignored warnings about dangerous water in the mines.

The government did not give them clear answers.

Sometimes, they got no answers at all.
