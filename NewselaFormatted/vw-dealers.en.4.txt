Engines in cars and trucks give off exhaust.

In the exhaust are gases like carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide.

These gases harm humans and the environment.

Cars are tested to see how much of these emissions go into the air from the engine.

Car companies try to lower the amount of exhaust.

One well-known car company is Volkswagen (VW).

Now people are upset with the company.

The automaker cheated emissions tests on their diesel cars.

Cars have computers inside them.

VW set the computers to give the wrong emissions information.

Buyers are angry.

The company's wrong actions have also hurt Volkswagen dealers.

The dealers do not work for Volkswagen.

No one can take them to court.

Still, they are caught in the middle.

The cars they sell have problems.

Their customers are angry.

The dealers do not make Volkswagens.

They only sell them, said Brian Maas.

He runs a group in California.

The group speaks for 50 VW dealers.

Volkswagen and the dealers worked together.

Buyers trusted the dealers.

Yet VW was not honest with the dealers.

So the company's actions hurt the dealers, he said.

Nearly 11 million Volkswagen cars are affected.

The cars passed emissions testing.

When the cars ran on the road things were different.

The results changed.

The engines gave off nitrogen oxide at 40 times more than the amount allowed in the United States.

The Environmental Protection Agency is part of the government.

It is called the EPA for short.

The EPA helps keep the environment safe.

The EPA said it would not allow Volkswagen's new diesel cars to be sold in 2016.

VW has told its dealers to stop selling the cars.

Now dealers have to wait to see how Volkswagen fixes the problem.

First, the company will have to take the cars back.

Next, they will have to tell dealers how to repair them.

Only then will the cars go back on the road.

Until then, the dealers cannot do anything.
