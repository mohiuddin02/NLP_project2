<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20140227_FOODLABELS.jpg" />WASHINGTON — On Thursday the Obama administration proposed the first major revamp of nutrition labels in more than 20 years.

The update emphasizes calorie information, including the amount of added sugars.

It also changes serving sizes to reflect how people really eat.

The changes are aimed, in part, at addressing serious public health issues.

These include [obesity](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity) — the condition of being extremely overweight — and other long-term diseases, such as diabetes.

Administration officials believe the new labels could lead consumers to make more healthful food choices.

They also hope to encourage the food industry to cut down on added sugars.

First lady Michelle Obama was to formally announce the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposal at the White House.

She has made better nutrition a focus of her "Let's Move!"

campaign.

This effort is devoted to battling childhood obesity.

"Our guiding principle here is very simple: that you as a parent and a consumer should be able to walk into your local grocery store, pick up an item off the shelf, and be able to tell whether it's good for your family," she said in a statement.

Thursday's announcement will begin a 90-day period for public comments on the proposal.

The administration plans to release a final set of rules within the next year, although there is no deadline.

Nutrition labels are found on about 700,000 products.

Given the costs tied to revising them, the FDA is not calling for an overnight change.

It is proposing instead that the new labels be phased in over a two-year period.

The Grocery Manufacturers Association, which represents more than 300 companies, said "the time is right for an update."

It called the proposal "a thoughtful review" and promised to work with the FDA.

But the organization also said: "It is critical that any changes are based on the most current and reliable science.

Equally as important is ensuring that any changes ultimately serve to inform, and not confuse, consumers."

On the proposed new labels, the calorie count would appear in larger, bold typeface.

The updated labels would also include a separate entry in the sugar section.

This new entry would allow consumers to distinguish between added sugar and natural sugar.

Administration officials said that would help consumers lower their intake of added sugar.

Nutrition expert Marion Nestle predicted pushback from large food companies.

"The food industry is really eager for people to not know how much sugar there is," she said.

Still, some claim the new added-sugar entry doesn't go far enough.

The FDA should also display the amount of sugar as a percentage of recommended daily value, argued Michael F. Jacobson, the founder of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.

"So many people consume far too much," he said.

Jacobson noted that the American Heart Association recommends that people consume very little added sugar.

It suggests women should take in no more than 25 grams per day and men no more than 35 grams per day.

One can of soda alone contains about 40 grams.

To ensure compliance, companies would have to keep records of added sugar for FDA inspection.

The FDA proposal would also change serving sizes to reflect the most recent information on consumer habits.

The serving size for soda, for example, is currently 8 ounces.

This number is meant to equal the quantity of soda people usually drink at one time, on average.

However, consumers often drink soda in 12-ounce cans or even larger bottles.

The current rules allow manufacturers to use a larger serving size, as some soda makers do.

But the proposed rule would require the serving size to be at least 12 ounces.

With the update, the serving sizes set in 1994 would increase for some products, such as ice cream.

For some other products, such as yogurt, sizes would decrease.

"The serving sizes for many foods are a joke now," said Jacobson.

"The half-cup of ice cream" or "2-ounce muffins and bagels," he said, haven't been seen in American eating habits "in decades."

Certain items that are typically finished all at once, such as a 20-ounce soda bottle, would be listed differently on the updated labels: Nutrition information would be given for the entire package.

New rules will also apply to items if a food package is two times the serving size and it could be consumed all at once.

For instance, a 24-ounce soda bottle would contain two 12-ounce servings under the new rules.

The FDA would require manufacturers to design a label with two columns.

This would provide a breakdown by both serving size and container size.

Administration officials said the new labels could bring between $20 billion and $30 billion in savings.

Officials didn't provide details, but it's likely that much of that would come from reduced medical expenses.

The cost of the new labels was estimated to be about $2 billion over 20 years.

The food industry would bear much of that cost, because it would be responsible for updating the labels.

Administration officials said widespread obesity was one of the primary reasons for the update.

While acknowledging that the new labels alone would not solve the problem, they said they believe the labels could help curb it.
