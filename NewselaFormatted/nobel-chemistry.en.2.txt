Three scientists from Sweden, the United States and Turkey won the prestigious Nobel Prize in chemistry on Wednesday.

Their work showed how the body's cells repair DNA that has been damaged.

DNA is a type of molecule, or group of atoms bound together.

DNA contains the genes that are passed down from parent to child.

Genes hold the instructions for how each part of the body works.

The three scientists' work has led to significant advances in medicine.

Over the years it has inspired the development of new cancer treatments.

Swedish scientist Tomas Lindahl, American Paul Modrich and U.S.-Turkish scientist Aziz Sancar did their groundbreaking research in the 1970s and 1980s.

They will split the award, which is nearly 1 million dollars, evenly.

The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said their work provided "fundamental knowledge" about how cells behave.

It said their work also shed light on both cancer and aging.

He was a group leader at the Francis Crick Institute and a director of Cancer Research UK at Clare Hall Laboratory in Britain.

Modrich, 69, is a researcher at Howard Hughes Medical Institute.

He is also a professor at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina.

Sancar, also 69, is a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

He is the second Turk to win a Nobel Prize, after novelist Orhan Pamuk was awarded the literature prize in 2006.

Sancar said the news was "quite a surprise."

He added that the win would be "very important" for Turkey.

"Young Turkish scientists need a role model showing that they can accomplish important contributions to science," he said.

Lindahl, who has worked for years in Britain, said he was having breakfast when a "nice lady" from the academy called.

It was only when she started speaking in Swedish that he realized it was not a prank, as he had first suspected.

"Then, of course, it starts sinking in that this is a great honor and a fantastic way of winding up my career," he said.

Modrich said he found out about his prize via an email from a co-worker.

The Swedish Academy had trouble locating him at first, because he was on vacation in New Hampshire.

The academy "didn't get my number, I guess, until later in the morning," he said.

However, Nobel officials did reach him "eventually, so I think it's real," he said with a chuckle.

Working separately, the three prizewinners figured out how a cell safeguards its DNA.

DNA is constantly under assault from ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun and various cancer-causing substances.

DNA was once thought to be a stable molecule, despite these assaults.

Then in the 1970s, Lindahl showed that it actually decays quite quickly.

He realized that the body must have some way of repairing damaged DNA.

Lindahl's realization opened up a new field of research, the academy said.

Working at Yale University, Sancar figured out how cells repair UV-damaged DNA.

Modrich showed how a cell corrects errors when DNA is duplicated during cell division.

The findings are significant for cancer research because DNA repairs keep cancer cells alive.

Researchers are now looking at ways to prevent repairs within cancer cells, in order to kill them.

One drug that attempts to do that is already on the market: olaparib, which is used to fight ovarian cancer.

The award will be handed out along with the other Nobel Prizes on December 10.

This year's medicine prize went to three scientists from Japan, the United States and China who discovered drugs to fight malaria and other tropical diseases.

Japanese and Canadian scientists won the physics prize for discovering that tiny particles called neutrinos have mass.
