Tesla Motors wants to make a new kind of car.

It will drive all on its own.

So far, cars cannot drive completely on their own.

People have to take the wheel sometimes.

Now Tesla has come up with something new.

It has figured out how to make cars change lanes.

The cars are able to do it on their own.

A lane is a part of a road.

Roads can have a few lanes.

They are separated by painted lines.

Cars stay mostly in one lane.

The cars are part of a line of cars in that lane.

Other cars stay in their own lanes.

Sometimes people need to change lanes.

They may want to pass a slow car in front of them.

They might want to turn off a road.

Changing lanes can be tricky.

Other cars might try to change lanes at the same time.

Up until now, people had to do it.

Cars were just not smart enough.

Tesla has solved that problem.

People can now let cars change lanes for them.

Elon Musk is the head of Tesla.

He says driving will be completely different now.

He thinks drivers will be amazed.

Elon said drivers still need to be careful.

They should keep their hands on the wheel.

If something goes wrong they should take over.

He said the car will remind them.

Someday drivers will not need to hold the wheel at all.

They will be able to just sit back.

The car will do all the driving.

Musk says cars like that will take awhile to build.

They could be ready in three years.

He thinks they will be safer than a person driving.
