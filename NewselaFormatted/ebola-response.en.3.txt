The United States and Britain are sending troops to Africa to help stop the deadly virus Ebola.

They will build treatment centers in Liberia and Sierra Leone to care for Ebola victims.

Ebola has killed more than 2,000 people since it was discovered in March.

Between 50 percent and 80 percent of the people who get it will die.

However, the World Health Organization (WHO) is worried that Ebola is spreading too fast.

Thousands more could become infected before the outbreak is brought under control, the WHO has warned.

The outbreak began in Guinea.

It quickly spread to the other West African nations of Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Senegal.

This is the worst Ebola outbreak in modern history.

In Liberia, the number of new cases is increasing faster than the number of hospital beds, the WHO said.

As soon as a new Ebola care center opens, it is immediately full.

"When patients are turned away at Ebola treatment centers, they have no choice but to return to their communities and homes," the WHO said.

They spread the disease when they return home.

Those who care for patients are among those hardest hit by Ebola.

People get Ebola through contact with the organs, blood or other fluids of infected people.

In Liberia alone, about 152 health care workers have come down with Ebola.

A total of 79 of them have died, according to the WHO.

Liberia is still recovering from years of war.

When the outbreak began, the country had only about one doctor for every 100,000 people.

In contrast, the U.S. has 250 doctors for every 100,000 people, according to the World Bank.

Every time a doctor or nurse gets sick or dies, it becomes harder to stop Ebola, the WHO said.

The fear of getting Ebola is keeping away many local and international doctors and nurses.

Too few of them are coming to care for patients.

There are not enough to slow down the spread of Ebola.

Symptoms of Ebola include fever.

People with the disease also experience weakness, muscle pain and headaches.

Ebola can cause kidney and liver failure, as well as bleeding inside the body.

There is no vaccine or cure.

The African nation of Sierra Leone borders Liberia.

A WHO doctor working at one Ebola center there has caught Ebola.

The doctor will be evacuated from the area, the WHO said Monday.

The doctor was the second international health worker sent by the WHO to Sierra Leone who had become infected.

President Barack Obama is sending U.S. military troops and equipment.

The soldiers will help set up isolation units.

The units will keep people with Ebola completely separate to prevent the disease from spreading.

Army Colonel Steve Warren is a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Defense.

The troops will build a 25-bed hospital in Monrovia to care for health workers.

Monrovia is the capital of Liberia.

The hospital will be turned over to the Liberian government once it has been set up.

But the troops will make sure that supplies stay at the hospital.

Supplies, like rubber gloves and mattresses, have been stolen from some of the hospitals.

They will also help keep it running for up to 180 days.

Obama said the U.S. needs to keep Ebola from spreading through Africa and other parts of the world.

If it spreads, "then it could be a serious danger to the United States," Obama said.

There are plans for another Ebola care center.

British military engineers and experts will build a center near the Sierra Leone capital of Freetown.

The center will have a total of 62 beds.

Local and international workers will run the center.

It will include a 12-bed area for health workers who become sick.
