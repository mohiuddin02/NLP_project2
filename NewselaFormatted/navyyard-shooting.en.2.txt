Thirteen people were killed when a former Navy man launched an attack Monday morning inside a building at the Washington Navy Yard, shooting office workers in the cafeteria and in the hallway, authorities said.

The gunman was among those killed at the heavily-secured facility.

Investigators said they had not established a motive for the shooting rampage.

The attack took place in the heart of the nation's capital, less than four miles from the White House.

As for whether it may have been a terrorist attack, Mayor Vincent Gray said: "We don't have any reason to think that at this stage."

But he said the possibility had not been ruled out.

For much of the day, authorities said they were looking for a possible second attacker wearing a military-style uniform.

But by late Monday night, they said they were convinced there was just a single gunman, and police began to ease the lockdown around the area.

"We do now feel comfortable that we have the single and sole person responsible for the loss of life inside the base today," Washington police Chief Cathy Lanier said.

President Barack Obama expressed sorrow for yet another mass shooting in the United States that he said took the lives of American patriots.

He promised to make sure "whoever carried out this cowardly act is held responsible."

It was the deadliest shooting at a U.S.-based military installation since Maj. Nidal Hasan killed 13 people and wounded 30 others in 2009 at Fort Hood in Texas.

He was convicted last month and sentenced to death.

The FBI took charge of the investigation at the Navy Yard.

It identified the gunman killed in the attack as 34-year-old Aaron Alexis of Texas.

He died after a running gunbattle with police, investigators said.

A federal law enforcement official said Alexis was believed to have gotten into the Navy Yard by using someone else's identification card.

The official was not authorized to discuss the case publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

It was not clear if the person whose ID Alexis used helped him or if the ID was stolen, authorities said.

The Navy said Alexis was a full-time reservist from 2007 to early 2011.

He and left as a petty officer third class.

It was not immediately clear why he left.

He had been working for a unit in Fort Worth, Texas.

The unit's job was providing supplies to the fleet.

The Navy listed his home of record as New York City.

In addition to those killed, at least three people — a police officer and two female civilians — were wounded.

They were listed in stable condition and were expected to survive.

The rampage took place at Building 197, the headquarters for Naval Sea Systems Command.

The unit buys, builds and maintains ships, submarines and combat computers.

About 3,000 people work at headquarters.

Many of them are citizens and not in the Navy.

The Washington Navy Yard is a sprawling maze of buildings and streets protected by armed guards and metal detectors.

Employees have to show their IDs at doors and gates to come and go.

Witnesses described a gunman opening fire from a fourth-floor overlook.

He aimed down on people in the cafeteria on the main floor.

Others said a gunman fired at them in a third-floor hallway.

It was not clear whether the witnesses on different floors were describing the same gunman.

Patricia Ward, a logistics-management specialist, said she was in the cafeteria getting breakfast.

"It was three gunshots straight in a row — pop, pop, pop.

Three seconds later, it was pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, so it was like about a total of seven gunshots, and we just started running," Ward said.

Todd Brundidge, an executive assistant with Navy Sea Systems Command, said he and other co-workers came across a gunman wearing all blue in a long hallway on the third floor.

"He just turned and started firing," Brundidge said.

Terrie Durham is an executive assistant with the same agency.

She said she also saw the gunman firing toward her and Brundidge.

"He aimed high and missed," she said.

"He said nothing.

As soon as I realized he was shooting, we just said, 'Get out of the building.'"

Around midday, police said they were searching for two men who may have taken part in the attack.

One was carrying a handgun and wearing a tan Navy-style uniform and a beret, the other was armed with a long gun and wearing an olive-green uniform.

Washington Police Chief Cathy Lanier said it was unclear if the men were members of the military.

But later in the day, police said in a tweet that the man in the tan uniform had been identified and was not involved in the shooting.

As emergency vehicles and law enforcement officers flooded streets around the facility, a helicopter hovered overhead.

Nearby schools were locked down.

Airplanes at Reagan National Airport were grounded so they would not interfere with law-enforcement choppers.

A short distance away, security was beefed up at the Capitol and other federal buildings, but officials said there was no known threat.

Senate officials shut down their side of the U.S. Capitol while authorities searched for the potential second suspect.

The House remained open.

Anxious relatives and friends of those who work at the Navy Yard waited to hear from loved ones.

According to public records, Alexis' neighbor called Fort Worth, Texas, police in September 2010 after she was nearly struck by a bullet that came from his downstairs apartment.

When police confronted Alexis, he said he was cleaning his gun when it accidentally discharged.

Alexis was arrested on suspicion of discharging a firearm within city limits but was not prosecuted.
