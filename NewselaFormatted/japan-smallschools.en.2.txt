Each one contains three desks in a space designed for many more.

"It's a little bit lonely," said Taiki Kato, 11, who said he was looking forward to going to middle school next year.

"It's a bit bigger and there might be kids from other elementary schools."

The town's middle school has eight students.

The elementary school has six students, and two of them, the only girls, are from the same family.

That meant Principal Yukari Sudo had just six names to learn when she began at the school.

Learning the staff members' names took a little longer, since there were twice as many of them.

Aone, population 638, has two small general stores and a single restaurant.

The average age here is 62.

Towns like Aone can be found across Japan.

For many years, people have been leaving the countryside in large numbers.

They move to Tokyo, Japan's capital city, where life is more exciting and it is easier to find a job.

Now, almost a third of Japan's 127 million people live in the greater Tokyo area.

With a rapidly aging society and a low birth rate, the situation is only going to get worse.

Fewer people are having fewer children.

By 2050, the number of children younger than 14 is expected to be half what it is now.

Meanwhile, by 2050, there will be about 5 million Japanese in their 90s.

Like Aone, nearly half the elementary and junior high schools in Japan have too few students.

The government in Tokyo would like to close these small schools and fold them into others nearby.

"If a small school has less than five classes, it should seriously and aggressively consider integrating with another school," said Hiroto Iwaoka.

He is the chief of education reform in Japan's education department.

Small schools are expensive to run, but money isn't the only factor.

Officials are also worried that kids at small schools see the same handful of classmates all the time and won't develop the social skills they need in the wider world.

Yet, local districts have resisted closing their tiny schools.

Kyoko Inoue is the chief of educational affairs in the region that Aone is in.

She said there's no plan to close the elementary school here, even though there's a much bigger school, with about 80 kids, 5 miles away.

"A school often functions as a core of a community," she said.

"We want a school to be something a local community desires."

Aone's elementary school certainly has a strong connection to the community.

Opened about 142 years ago, the school had as many as 254 students in 1945.

Even now, its music room has a grand piano and the science room is stocked with lab equipment.

The library is filled with books.

All of this is now just for six students.

For a class one day recently, the six students walked to a field where they planted potato seeds.

Next they ate lunch — grilled fish, rice, and soup with tofu, bamboo shoots and asparagus.

Then they collected mushrooms from the forest and did stretching exercises in the cold gym.

The school does manage to have sports days, even though there aren't enough players to form a whole soccer team.

The teachers also have to be careful not to put too many kids in the cheering squad.

Otherwise, there will be no one to play.

There are educational limitations, too.

There are not enough students to fill even one grade, so teachers have to teach kids of different ages at the same time.

"In a bigger school, children learn social skills and how to live in the real world," said Kotoe Arakawa.

She teaches the younger children.

"These kids are so well behaved and so gentle, so when they get into a bigger group they sometimes find it hard to speak out."

But there are advantages to having such a small school, the teachers say.

"There are no students that get left behind here, because we stick to the subject until each kid gets it," Arakawa said.

Chiharu Yamaguchi is the mother of the only two girls.

She moved to Aone nine years ago.

"I was worried about sending my kids to the school, but we decided to try it and I got to know the school and the parents and the teachers," she said.

"And that got rid of my worries."
