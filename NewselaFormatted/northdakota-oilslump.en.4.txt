Four huge drilling rigs sit in North Dakota.

The machines dig holes in the earth and bring up oil from the rock below.

Right now, the machines are not being used.

They are waiting for the price of oil to rise.

When the price of oil is high, there is enough money to pay people to work on the rigs.

For six years, things were good.

Right now, the price of oil is not high.

Many people have lost their jobs.

Shay Hunt is 35 years old and a father of three.

He used to work on a rig.

Now he works as a night watchman.

"Over there, that was my rig," Hunt said.

He has worked the oil fields for more than 13 years.

Hunt says people who work on rigs are strong.

They work through rain, lightning and freezing weather.

The drop in the price of oil is rough, though People are not that worried in Williston.

City leaders say it is nice for things to slow down a bit.

For many years, the town was changing fast.

People do not know how bad things will get.

To keep people in the town, new homes, schools and roads are being built.

Cindy Sanford helps workers find jobs.

She said new people come into her office every day.

There are still a lot of jobs, but they do not pay as much money as they used to.

Kelsey Thorne is from California.

She is going to open an Italian restaurant.

She said it is easier to do in Williston than it would have been back home.
