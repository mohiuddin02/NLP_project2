America has more than 10 million old cars.

Many people love old cars and want to keep them running forever.

They call their old old cars vintage, or classic.

Fans of old cars are worried these days, though.

They say not enough young people are learning how to fix classic automobiles.

Most of the people who know how to fix old cars are getting pretty old themselves.

Many are retiring, or giving up their jobs.

These important skills might be lost.

To help solve this problem, Pennsylvania College began offering a new set of classes in 2012.

The courses teach young students how to fix old cars.

So far 31 students have signed up.

Eight have already finished their training.

Students who learn to fix old cars usually have a job waiting for them.

There is now plenty of work for young people who learn the special skills needed.

"There are jobs everywhere," said Diane Fitzgerald of America's Car Museum in Tacoma, Washington.

Jay Rhoads is certainly happy he signed up for Pennsylvania College's new courses.

This spring, he got to work on a 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS 454.

The car was built to have a lot of power.

"Just sitting behind the wheel and starting it up is enough to make your heart race," said Rhoads, 27.

Eugene Toner has also been learning to fix old cars.

He and other students worked on a 1916 Scripps-Booth Model D automobile.

The 100-year-old Scripps was very hard to fix.

It is a one-of-a-kind car and had not been driven since 1959.

When the students got hold of it, it looked pretty good.

After all, it had been carefully stored in a museum for years.

However, it did not actually run.

Because the Scripps is such an unusual car the students could not just look up ways to fix it.

They had to figure it out themselves.

So the students did the best they could.

They replaced worn parts and tinkered with the engine.

On the last day of class they finally got the old car going.

The engine started up for the first time in more than 50 years.

They decided to bring it to The Elegance, one of the nation's most important old car shows.

On the big day Toner had a problem.

He could not start up the Scripps.

The engine clanked and coughed, but would not start.

Toner's teacher soon came to the rescue.

He jiggled an engine part for a bit.

A few moments later, the Scripps-Booth roared to life.

Toner began proudly riding it around the show grounds.

Altogether, 74 of the world's finest automobiles were at the show.

Large crowds came to see the special cars.

The students who had fixed the Scripps-Booth stood by it at the show.

They were dressed in the sort of clothes people wore in 1916.

Show-goers stopped by to admire the Scripps.

They took pictures and asked questions.

The Scripps ended up winning a prize.

As he gave out the prize the show's announcer praised the students' work.

"It's nice to see somebody under 100" who likes old cars, he joked.
