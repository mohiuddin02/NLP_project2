"You're not going to be one of those guys that parks in the front yard and lets chickens run around in the front yard, are you?"

Rick Rodriguez Sr.'s new neighbor asked him.

It was the mid-1980s and Rodriguez had just moved to Downey, California.

At the time, there were only a few other Latinos living in the area.

Rodriguez went on to found the state's largest Latino-owned private security firm.

He sold the home next to that neighbor and bought several other properties, all of them in Downey.

Rodriguez's grandparents crossed into the United States illegally from Mexico.

Now he is part of a wave of second- and third-generation Latino immigrants who have transformed Downey and several other small cities near Los Angeles over the last two decades.

Middle-class Latino neighborhoods are proof that the Latino community as a whole is growing stronger and wealthier.

Latinos are now the largest ethnic group in California, according to U.S. Census Bureau figures released in June.

The average Latino income is still lower than the average white income, but rising quickly.

Immigrants are moving out of big, crowded cities into smaller towns.

Experts expect Latinos' income and education levels to keep increasing in the future.

According to the Census Bureau, the average income for Latinos rose 3.5 percent between 2012 and 2013 to reach $40,963.

It was the first annual increase since 2000.

Downey, a small city in southeastern Los Angeles County, is nearly 75 percent Latino.

Many of the jobs in the area had something to do with the space shuttle program.

The aerospace industry has slowed since then, but that has not been a problem for Downey.

It is booming with new shopping centers and businesses.

The average household in Downey earns a little more than $55,000 a year, which is much higher than similar cities in the surrounding area.

One in 5 households earns at least $100,000.

Jody Agius Vallejo is a professor at the University of Southern California.

She describes Downey as the city that Latinos in lower-income towns hope to move to because of its good schools and relatively low crime rate.

She says the growing number of Latinos moving to Downey has changed the city, and the city has also changed many of them.

Some Latinos say that moving to Downey has meant that certain old ways of doing things were left behind.

"Living in Downey is a symbol of making it," Vallejo said.

Sometimes people try to act a certain way when they move here because they feel the need to prove they've moved up, she said.

Gilbert Alarcon runs a printing shop in downtown Downey and says the city is known as the "Mexican Beverly Hills."

"When you think of Downey, you think of a step above.

You work your way in here," said Alarcon, 49.

"We moved up the ladder, from Bell to South Gate and Downey.

We never looked back."

Alarcon said he felt out of place when he first moved to Downey, but also proud to have moved into the city.

The weekend after he moved in, Alarcon decided to wash his car.

He knew better than to park it on the front lawn like he used to, but figured washing it in the driveway would be fine.

Alarcon had the hose in his hand when he stopped, scanned the street and second-guessed himself.

Nobody else was washing their car, so he worried that neighbors might think "there goes the neighborhood now that the Latinos have moved in."

He decided to use the hose to water the lawn instead, then took his Nissan to the car wash. "You have to step it up a notch so you can set the foundation for the Latino family that comes after you," Alarcon said.

"If you follow your old customs, nothing will change.

You'll just bring the old neighborhood with you."

Alarcon said he did not do things differently to please his white neighbors.

He was avoiding disapproval from other Latinos who might frown at the "old ways."

Eventually, he found himself looking down on the old customs, too.

Census data from 2007 indicates that Latinos own 45 percent of businesses in Downey.

One local business owner, Valentin Flores, said that many Latinos run their businesses with other Latinos in mind, but still look for ways to bring in non-Latino customers.

Flores says that many of Downey's business owners are second-, third- and fourth- generation immigrants, so they do not feel the need to separate themselves from their white neighbors.

"It's not a population that is screaming, 'We are something else!'"

he said.
