It is used to attack enemy vehicles and other targets on the ground.

The Warthog could be the latest plane killed off as the Pentagon tries to save money.

The plane comes from the 1970s.

It has a seven-barreled gun the size of a small car.

The gun is located in the plane's nose.

The A-10 has a reputation for tearing apart tanks.

It clears the way for troops on the ground with its huge bullets.

But military leaders have targeted the ugly looking plane for a few years.

The Air Force prefers planes that fight well in the air and drop bombs guided by computers.

It would rather spend its shrinking amount of money on new planes like those.

Last month, the Air Force said that getting rid of the A-10s would save it about $3.5 billion.

Warthog supporters in Congress rushed to action.

They took steps to stop any more A-10 planes from being retired until 2021 or later.

Last week, 33 lawmakers wrote a letter to top military officials.

They expressed "deep concern" about retiring the A-10.

Last month, Senator Kelly Ayotte from New Hampshire blocked the White House's choice to lead the Air Force from starting her job.

Ayotte wanted answers about what was happening to the plane before she agreed to let her start working.

There's even a Facebook group called Save the A-10.

The group has more than 4,000 supporters.

There will be other battles like the one over the A-10.

The military says it must slash its older weapons to save money.

But these programs support troops.

They also provide thousands of jobs across many states.

So Congress keeps coming to their rescue.

The military is facing spending cuts of $487 billion over 10 years.

Some in Congress feel there are better places to cut than programs like the A-10.

They say meetings, air shows and the number of workers at military headquarters could be cut instead.

No one questions the A-10's success.

The plane is considered one of the best at directly protecting troops on the ground.

Pilots do that with its powerful Gatling gun.

The A-10 was designed in the 1970s around the gun.

It is the heaviest cannon with several barrels ever put on an plane.

Pilots can shoot short bursts that unleash 140 rounds of ammunition in two seconds.

The plane is designed to keep flying even if parts of the wing or one of its engines have been blown to pieces.

The cockpit is where the pilot sits.

It is surrounded by a metal tub that blocks bullets.

But the military calls the A-10 an aircraft that can only do one job.

And that's the problem.

The Air Force has said it wants to get rid of planes that do just one thing.

Instead, it wants to build planes that can blast enemies apart on the ground and in the sky.

The A-10 can't fight other planes in the sky.

It's not quiet, and it's not really fast.

The A-10's replacement is the F-35 fighter jet.

The military paid nearly $400 billion for more than 2,400 of those planes.

The military likes the jet because it could be used by the Air Force, Navy and Marines.

The F-35 can take off and land on runways and aircraft carriers, as well as hover in one spot in the air like a helicopter.

No single fighter plane has been able to do all that.

And it is expensive.

The F-35 costs $35,200 for each hour it flies.

That's twice as much as the A-10, says the government.

The F-35 certainly has more than one use.

That's the problem, said Todd Harrison, a military expert in Washington, D.C.

If spending is going to be cut a lot, where are the cuts going to come from: expensive new weapons that can carry out more missions, or older, simpler weapons?

The F-35 provides 127,000 jobs in 47 states and Puerto Rico.

Someone is going to be upset if there's a plan to buy fewer of the planes, Harrison said.

"Everyone knows there needs to be cuts, but few people in Congress are brave enough to actually make them," he said.

"Bottom line is there are going to be a lot of angry people in Congress — no matter what."
