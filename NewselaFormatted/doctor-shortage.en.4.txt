<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20140106_DOCTORS.jpg" />WASHINGTON â€” Millions of people are signing up for health care under a new government program.

It's called the Affordable Care Act.

It's also known as Obamacare.

But, there may not be enough doctors and dentists for all the new patients.

Some changes could help.

New technologies are being tried.

And medical workers who aren't doctors are being allowed to do more for patients.

But that will only happen in the long run.

"In the meantime," said Linda Rosenberg, "people are going to suffer."

She runs the National Council for Behavioral Health.

The government says that one out of every five Americans live in areas without enough general doctors.

One-sixth live in areas with too few dentists.

Nearly a third are in areas with too few mental health providers.

They care for people with emotional problems.

The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) says something needs to change.

If not, there will be too few general doctors in the U.S. By 2020, there will be 45,000 too few.

There will also be a shortfall of 46,000 specialists.

They are doctors who just treat certain health problems.

One might treat brain problems.

Another might treat skin problems.

The lack of numbers is worse than it seems.

Many general doctors and dentists do not accept Medicaid patients.

Medicaid is health coverage for poor people.

It's paid for by the government.

But the government pays doctors less for Medicaid patients.

And many new people getting health care will be covered through Medicaid.

About 36 million Americans are expected to gain coverage under Obamacare.

Christiane Mitchell works at the AAMC.

She predicts that many of those 36 million will have long wait times to see doctors close by.

Or, they will have to travel far from home to see them.

There are various reasons for the shortfalls.

One is the aging of the baby boomers.

They're the group of people born between 1946 and 1964.

That large age group has growing health needs.

It's becoming a problem for health care workers.

Many doctors in the boomer age group are retiring too.

That is making things even worse.

The government expects the number of doctors will increase a little.

But the number of Americans over 65 is expected to grow much more.

The government thinks they will increase by more than a third in the next 10 years.

Money is another reason for the shortfalls.

General doctors earn less than specialists.

Around $3 million less over their lives, in fact.

That makes becoming a general doctor less appealing.

But money is not the only reason, Mitchell said.

In surveys, medical students say a "work-life balance" is more important than money.

Being a general doctor often involves long hours.

And patients may call you on nights and weekends.

For many students, that doesn't sound appealing.

Half of the doctors in training are women, Mitchell said.

Many of them want to have children.

So, more of them want a job that doesn't have long hours.

Dealing with different types of health coverage has scared some medical students away from becoming doctors, said Rosenberg.

And, many doctors have to buy expensive equipment.

Doctors can also be taken to court if something goes wrong.

Nowadays, Rosenberg said, "the best and the brightest" don't want to go into medicine.

Instead, they choose jobs in banking or technology, she said.
