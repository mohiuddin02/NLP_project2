Disneyland is getting crowded.

So is Disney's California Adventure.

Lines for rides can take more than an hour.

Visitors have to park far away.

The Walt Disney Company is not sure what to do.

Some people want Disney to change its prices.

They say tickets should cost more money.

That way, people would not go all the time.

Disney is trying that idea.

Weekend tickets used to cost $92.

Now they cost $96.

Disney has also stopped selling one-year passes.

The passes were for people who live near the parks.

The passes let them visit over and over.

They could even go on the very busy days.

Now Disney's neighbors have different passes.

They only go to the parks on weekdays.

That leaves more room for weekend guests.

Some people think Disney should make the parks bigger.

They want people to have more rides to share.

Disney does have space for more rides.

There is enough land to build a new park next door.

It would take lots of time and money.

The company is too busy to start on another park right now.

Disney is already building one in China.

It will open next year.

Disney is spending $4 billion.

Disney will watch to see if the new prices help.

Disney will also work on adding more parking spaces.
