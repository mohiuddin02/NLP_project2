An obese person is someone who is very overweight.

Scientists already knew that being obese is bad for your health.

Now, they have discovered something else: obesity make teens less likely to finish high school.

The new study of obesity was done in Sweden.

It looked at both obese and non-obese students.

The scientists discovered a big difference between the two groups.

Obese students are far less likely to finish high school.

The Swedish scientists studied 1,061 obese people.

All were at least 20 years old.

At that age, they were old enough to have finished high school.

The scientists also looked at another group.

They were not obese.

There were 7,780 people in that group.

The idea was to see how far people in each group had gotten in their schooling.

Almost everyone in both groups finished junior high.

After that, the two groups became very different.

Swedish students do not have to go to high school if they do not want to.

But most choose to go.

About 1 out of every 10 slim students decided not to go to high school.

Two out of every 10 obese students chose not to.

Also, many of the obese students who went to high school dropped out.

Nearly 1 in 5 started high school and quit later.

The slimmer students did much better.

Only a little more than 1 in 10 left school without finishing.

Overall, only about half of the obese students finished high school.

More than three-quarters of their slimmer classmates did.

The scientists could not find anything other than obesity to cause the difference between the two groups.

For example, it did not matter where the students were from.

It also did not matter how much money their parents had.

The scientists did notice one important difference.

In both groups, girls were more likely to finish high school than boys.

The scientists hope their discovery will lead to action.

Something must be done to keep obese teens from dropping out, they said.
