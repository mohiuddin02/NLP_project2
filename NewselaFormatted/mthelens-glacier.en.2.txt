Ray Yurkewycz perched on the rim of Mount St. Helens.

He marveled at the ancient forces still at work in the Northwest's most restless volcano.

Rocks and boulders slid off the crater walls, kicking up dust.

Steam rose from the twin domes formed after Mount St. Helens' big eruption in 1980.

But Yurkewycz, who is the operations director for the nonprofit Mount St. Helens Institute, was focused less on the volcano's fiery past than its icy present.

Few people realize, he said, that the hollowed-out crater now holds the world's youngest glacier.

Crater Glacier is also growing at a time when most glaciers around the globe are shrinking.

"It's cascading down into this valley now," Yurkewycz said, pointing out a tongue of ice flowing over a rise and into a rocky ravine.

"It's only been in the last two years that it started doing that."

Yurkewycz led a small hiking group to the north ridge late last month.

They were treated to a rare, close-up view of the glacier.

Not only are the rugged upper slopes dangerous, but the area serves as an open-air laboratory for scientists tracking the area's recovery.

The guided hike allows visitors to scramble off-trail to the glacier lookout.

Mount St. Helens Institute began the outing three years ago.

It will offer nine hikes this year, beginning in late July.

At $195 per person, critics say it is too expensive.

They want people to have greater freedom to hike the entire 110,000-acre Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument.

Scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) Cascades Volcano Observatory have been visiting the area since the early 1980s.

They have recorded the unique conditions that led to the glacier's formation and its stunning growth.

"Nothing about this glacier is typical," USGS scientist Steve Schilling said.

Before 1980, Mount St. Helens was shaped like a cone and was surrounded by a dozen small glaciers.

Most were destroyed during the eruption.

The mountain's north side collapsed, unleashing the biggest landslide ever recorded.

The blast wiped out everything for miles around and destroyed 230 square miles of forest.

When the dust and ash settled, a horseshoe-shaped shell of a mountain was left.

That shell provided a perfect nest for a baby glacier.

The shell faces northward, which helps shield snow from the sun.

A thick layer of volcanic rock on the crater floor blocks the volcanic heat from below.

A lava dome formed an area where snow could pile up.

By 1988, a permanent snowfield more than 200 feet thick lay in the crater.

But things really got weird in 2004.

That is when the volcano sputtered back to life.

It alternately spit steam and oozed thick, pasty lava for several years.

The magma quickly built a new dome more than 1,200 feet high.

The USGS team feared the heat would melt the glacier and send water and mud rampaging through the valleys below.

But the ice was so well protected by the rock layer that very little melted away.

Now, the glacier is creeping farther down the valley.

A steady stream of meltwater springs from the base of the glacier, watering trees and flowers below.

The ice is about 650 feet thick in places, said USGS geologist Dave Sherrod.

Measured in a straight line, the glacier is 1.25 miles long.

The surface is so covered with volcanic rock that only a few glints of blue ice can be seen.

In fact, Schilling thinks nearly one-third of the glacier is rock.

"It's pretty exciting," Sherrod said.

"You can have rocks the size of a Volkswagen being hurled down at you."

Poisonous gas occasionally drifts from the lava dome.

The interior of the glacier is full of caves.

A group of expert cave mappers got permission last year to explore those caverns for the first time.

They rappelled in through a funnel-shaped mouth they called the Godzilla Hole, said Jared Smith.

He is the lead guide for the Mount St. Helens Institute.

"It's probably 80 or 90 feet straight down," Smith said.

Inside, they found a steamy wonderland of sculpted ice and tunnels.

"It's just totally beautiful."
