The Nazi soldiers made their orders very clear: Jewish American prisoners of war (POWs) were to be separated from other soldiers and sent to an uncertain fate.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/Mideast_Israel_Americ_Edit.jpg" /> But Master Sergeant Roddie Edmonds would have none of that.

As a noncommissioned officer held in the German POW camp, he ordered more than 1,000 Americans captives to step forward with him and brazenly pronounced, "We are all Jews here."

He would not waver, even with a pistol to his head, and his captors eventually backed down.

Seventy years later, the Knoxville, Tennessee, native is being posthumously recognized with Israel's highest honor for non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews during World War II.

He's the first American serviceman to earn the honor.

"Master Sergeant Roddie Edmonds seemed like an ordinary American soldier, but he had an extraordinary sense of responsibility and dedication to his fellow human beings," said Avner Shalev.

He is the chairman of the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum and memorial in Jerusalem, Israel, which is honoring Edmonds.

"The choices and actions of Master Sergeant Edmonds set an example for his fellow American soldiers as they stood united against the barbaric evil of the Nazis."

It's a story that remained untold for decades and one that his son, the Reverend Chris Edmonds, only discovered long after his father's death in 1985.

Edmonds was captured with thousands of others in the Battle of the Bulge in late 1944 and spent 100 days in captivity.

His son vaguely knew about his father's past from a pair of diaries Edmonds kept that included the names and addresses of his men and some of his daily thoughts.

But it was only while scouring the Internet a few years ago that he began to unravel what really happened.

Oddly enough, he learned about his father's heroism when he read a newspaper article about former President's Richard Nixon's search for a home in New York.

As it happened, Nixon purchased his home from Lester Tanner, a prominent New York lawyer who mentioned how Edmonds had saved him and dozens of other Jews during the war.

That sparked a search for Tanner, who along with another Jewish POW, Paul Stern, told the younger Edmonds what they witnessed on Jan. 27, 1945, at the Stalag IXA POW camp near Ziegenhain, Germany.

The German army had a strict anti-Jew policy and segregated Jewish POWs from non-Jews.

On the eastern front, captured Jewish soldiers in the Russian army had been sent to extermination camps.

At the time of Edmonds' capture, the worst of the Nazi death camps were no longer fully operational.

Instead, Jewish American POWs were sent to slave labor camps where their chances of survival were low.

U.S. soldiers had been warned that Jewish fighters among them would be in danger if captured and were told to destroy dog tags or any other evidence identifying them as Jewish.

So when the German camp commander, speaking in English, ordered the Jews to identify themselves, Edmonds knew what was at stake.

Turning to the rest of the POWs, he said, "We are not doing that, we are all falling out," recalled Chris Edmonds.

He is currently in Israel participating in a seminar for Christian leaders at Yad Vashem's International School for Holocaust Studies.

With all the camp's inmates defiantly standing in front of their barracks, the German commander turned to Edmonds and said, "They cannot all be Jews."

To which Edmonds replied: "We are all Jews here."

Then the Nazi officer pressed his pistol to Edmonds' head and offered him one last chance.

Edmonds merely gave him his name, rank and serial number.

And then Edmonds said, "If you are going to shoot, you are going to have to shoot all of us because we know who you are and you'll be tried for war crimes when we win this war," recalled Chris Edmonds.

He estimates his father's actions saved the lives of more than 200 Jewish-American soldiers.

Witnesses said the German officer then withdrew.

Stern, who currently lives in Reston, Virginia, told Yad Vashem that even 70 years later he can "still hear the words."

About 6 million European Jews were killed by German Nazis and their collaborators during World War II.

The names of those honored for risking their lives to protect Jews are engraved along an avenue of trees at the Jerusalem memorial.

More than 26,000 have been designated "Righteous Among the Nations."

The most famous of them were Oskar Schindler, whose efforts to save more than 1,000 Jews were documented in Steven Spielberg's 1993 film "Schindler's List," and Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat who is credited with having saved at least 20,000 Jews before mysteriously disappearing.

But prior to Edmonds, only four of the Righteous were Americans, and they belonged to the clergy or volunteered for rescue groups.

Edmonds is the first serviceman and the first whose actions saved the lives of fellow Americans.

A ceremony for Edmonds is planned for next year, and, thanks to his son's efforts, Edmonds is now also being considered for a Congressional Medal of Honor.

Irena Steinfeldt, the director of Yad Vashem's Righteous Among the Nations department, said all rescue stories were unique.

She said Edmonds actions reflected the experiences of a military man, who was prepared to take a quick, clear, moral decision.

"It's a matter of five minutes and that is it.

When he tells the German, 'No,' that is something that can kill him," she explained.

"It is something very dangerous that is happening in one moment.

...

But it is very heroic."

Chris Edmonds, who leads a Baptist congregation, said he believed his father's actions were inspired by a "deep moral conviction" instilled by his faith.

"All he had to fight with was his will power and his wits," he said.

"I'm just glad he did the right thing."
