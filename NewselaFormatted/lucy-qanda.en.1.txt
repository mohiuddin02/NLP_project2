This month marks the 40th anniversary of the discovery of Lucy, one of the earliest ancestors of humans.

Lucy, who was about 3 feet, 6 inches tall, walked the Earth upright on two legs about 3.5 million years ago.

Her 1974 discovery forever changed the understanding of where Homo sapiens came from and how they evolved.

Donald Johanson is the paleoanthropologist who found the partial remains of Lucy's skeleton in the Hadar area of central Ethiopia.

He and his team named the fossil after the Beatles song "Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds," which played repeatedly the night he made the discovery.

These days, Johanson serves as the founding director of the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University.

He spoke to the Los Angeles Times about Lucy's impact on paleoanthropology, the study of early humans through their fossilized bones and footprints, and what he hopes to find next.

_The following interview with Johanson has been adapted by Newsela to simplify and explain some of the complicated concepts he discusses._ **Q: Before Lucy, what was the accepted narrative of human evolution, the science of how living things began and evolved over time?

** A: In the early 1970s when I first went into the field, there was a tug-of-war going on between Europe and Africa.

Most people thought the earliest origin of humans was in Africa, but we really became human only in Europe.

**Q: How did the discovery of Lucy change that?

** A: She shifted, very dramatically, anthropologists' view of where we obtained our human characteristics.

She showed us that it happened in eastern Africa, and more specifically in the area of Ethiopia where she was found.

She also allowed us to say conclusively that walking upright began as long as 3.5 million years ago.

That was a major leap in our understanding of the sequence of events of human evolution.

**Q: How do you know she walked upright?

** A: Because we had her pelvis.

It's a very rare discovery to find a pelvis, the ring of bones that connect the abdomen to the legs.

Hers is so strikingly different from the pelvis of a four-legged animal like a chimpanzee, which has a high narrow pelvis with the hip bones facing forward.

Our pelvis is squat and wide with the hip bones forming a bowl.

Lucy's body still had relatively short legs and relatively long arms, which is the kind of anatomy we see in more tree-living species.

So she was an important bridge for us between more ancient sorts of things and more modern sorts of things.

**Q: Why was upright walking an evolutionary advantage in Lucy's time?

** A: Walking upright had the advantage of freeing the front limbs for other things.

This allowed early humans to carry food back to a home base and share it with members of one's own tribe or band.

We don't know what all the benefits were, but it was obviously a major breakthrough.

The ape population has been shrinking for a long time, but there are, what, 8 billion of us today?

**Q: How has the science of human origins continued to change since Lucy's discovery?

** A: When I entered the field, we had maybe six or seven different fossils of early human species.

Now we have 15 or 20.

So what has changed is that we understand it was not a straight line from the earliest species to modern humans, and that there were many false starts.

**Q: Are there major holes in the story of our origins that you would especially like to see filled in?

** A: At the Institute of Human Origins we are working to answer the specific question: What are the evolutionary foundations of modern humans?

The features that distinguish us from all other animals are language, our cooperation, and a culture that allows us to make developments that build on what came before, which no single individual could make alone.

So, how did all of that come about?

**Q: Anything else?

** A: I'd also like to know where our particular genus, a more general category than species, came from.

Every person in the world now is a Homo sapien, but there were other Homo genera, too.

Lucy's species, Australopithecus afarensis, died out about 3 million years ago, but the oldest evidence of the Homo genus we have is from 2.3 million years ago.

That means our own genus began between 2.3 million and 3 million years ago, and that's the time period where people are looking.

**Q: Is there a specific geological place where you think the answer might be found?

** A: The geological strata, the layer of rock, from the 2.5-million- to 3-million-year period in the Afar region of Ethiopia north of where Lucy was found.

People are also planning on looking at Kenya.

These layers are devilish to work because they don't have many fossils in them.

There are some fossils, though, so it's possible that something can be found in there that could finally link Australopithecus with Homo.

**Q: Some people feel that the world has been picked over, and there is nothing left to discover.

Do you agree?

** A: One of the changes in paleoanthropology that is so healthy is the switch from being driven by discoveries to a more analytical level of scientific research.

There are thousands of fossils in vaults throughout the world that have not been deeply studied.

We can now look at the fossils and see what diets were like.

We can also use computerized tomography scans, a type of X-ray, to look at teeth and what they can tell us about life histories.

There are also rock formations throughout Africa that have not been thoroughly examined, and I think new discoveries will be made that will be surprising.

As I tell my students, you are only limited by your imagination.
