Nieves Garcia came from Mexico when she was 6.

She learned English.

Even after that, her school called her an "English learner."

Garica did not want her daughter called an "English learner."

So she lied.

Garcia told the school the family spoke only English at home.

In truth, her husband does not speak English.

"I just said we spoke English, English, English and English," Garcia said.

Garcia is not the only one.

Other parents lie about what language their family speaks.

No one knows how many lie.

The parents do not want their children taken out of class to learn English.

They also worry their kids could miss out on advanced classes.

California's education leaders say it's a problem.

Children may not get the extra help they need.

They may fall behind in their schoolwork.

California will use a new English language test in 2016.

It is also thinking about another change.

The state asks parents what language they speak at home.

It may change the questions it asks.

Almost half of Californians older than 5 speak another language.

Spanish is the most common.

That is a big change from 1990.

Then, just one out of three people over 5 spoke another language.

In 2012, kindergarteners in California were tested in English.

Very few of them passed.

It made some parents angry.

They said children should not be tested so young.

They also said the test was too hard.

Alison Bailey teaches at the University of California.

Children can speak two languages well, she said.

Earlier this year, Tesha Sengupta-Irving signed her son up for kindergarten.

Her parents were visiting her then.

They come from India.

She spoke to them in their language, Bengali.

So she told the school her family spoke Bengali at home.

The school decided her son was an English learner.

Sengupta-Irving was not happy about it.

Her son only knew a few words in Bengali.

He really spoke only English.
