At Disney theme parks, workers dressed as popular characters walk around.

They are friendly.

The characters spend time with visitors.

These performers can help make Disney parks feel magical.

There is a secret though.

No one is supposed to know the people behind the costumes.

Disney wants to keep it that way.

Disney does not let its workers talk to the public about their characters.

Now a group helping Disney workers is fighting the rule.

The group is called the Teamsters.

Disney has strong rules for its characters.

People playing characters cannot write anything online.

They cannot talk to the news media about their work.

The group helping workers does not think these rules are fair.

The group says Disney has gone too far.

They say the company should not control what Disney workers say about their jobs.

They are not spies, one worker said.

Working as a Disney character does not need to be top secret, he said.

Now the Teamsters are doing something.

The group wants the rules to change.

The Teamsters sent a complaint to Disney.

They are also going to ask the government for help.

Disney wants to keep these rules.

Workers agree to the rules when they start their jobs.

Disney wants all guests to have a good time at the park.

If some workers break the rules, it could change how guests in the park feel about Disney.

There are more than 1,200 people at Disney who dress as characters.

Some are "fur characters."

Winnie the Pooh is one of those.

Fur characters wear costumes that cover the body completely.

There are also "face characters."

Snow White and Cinderella are face characters.

Disney wants the characters to look like they just stepped out of the movies.

The company wants guests to feel like the characters are real.

Lee Cockerell used to help run Disney World.

He said Disney is serious about keeping its magic.

"You don't want to start disappointing kids by having this out there."
