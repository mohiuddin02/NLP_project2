Malala Yousafzai is the world's youngest [ Nobel Peace Prize winner.

](https://newsela.com/articles/Nobel-peacewinner/id/5580/) She is just 17 years old.

The prize goes to people who have helped make the world a better place.

Its winners are fighters for peace and human rights.

On June 26, Malala came to speak at San Jose State University in California.

As she walked onto the stage, the first words she said to the cheering crowd were "Thank you."

About 4,000 people had gathered to hear from Malala.

Girls held her book, "I Am Malala."

Parents whispered her story into the ears of their children.

Malala grew up in Pakistan's Swat Valley.

Her part of the country was under the control of an Islamic group known as the Taliban.

The Taliban are very old-fashioned.

They believe that women should not go out alone or work outside the home.

They also believe that girls should not go to school.

Malala first began pushing against the Taliban's rules when she was only 11 years old.

She began writing online after the Taliban shut down girls' schools.

She wrote under the fake name "Gul Makai."

Malala's writings were read by many people.

She described life under the Taliban from the point of view of a young girl not allowed to go to school.

Eventually it became known that she was "Gul Makai."

She began speaking out openly.

The Taliban attempted to silence Malala forever when she was 15.

On Oct. 9, 2012, a man shot three bullets into her head.

The attack captured the world's attention.

Malala was taken by plane to a hospital in Peshawar, Pakistan, and then to England.

Doctors managed to save her life.

Since then, Malala has continued to fight for girls' right to go to school.

Pakistan is not the only country in which girls have a hard time getting an education.

The same thing is true in many other countries.

Malala now travels the world speaking for her cause.

She leads the Malala Fund, a group that fights to give girls the right to go to school.

At the university in San Jose, Malala appeared with Afghan-American writer Khaled Hosseini.

The two talked talked together on the stage.

Hosseini said that the gunman had "shot the girl he was meant to shoot.

But in every other way, he shot the wrong girl."

The Taliban did not know who they were dealing with, he said.

Malala is not someone who gives up easily.

During the hourlong talk, Malala was both wise and funny.

"There has always been this fear that if you give girls education, then girls will get out of control," she said.

"You have the right to education, and you have the right to discover more in life."

She also joked that in her family, her brothers think she is treated better than they are.

"I think that's fine," she said, with a smile.

Malala described how girls in Pakistan are treated as less important than boys.

It even shows up at the dinner table, she said.

"Boys would get the chest piece and the leg piece of the chicken, while girls would get the wings and the neck."

Hosseini then asked Malala why she decided to speak up.

"If you remain in silence, you will continue to live in terrorism," Malala said.

Life is also hard when you speak up, she said.

Still, she thinks it is better to fight back.
