In 1869 a new railroad line was finished.

It was a first in U.S. history.

The railroad stretched from one end of the country to the other.

It allowed people to travel from the East Coast to the West Coast by train.

It took thousands of men to build.

Around 12,000 of them came all the way from China to work on the line.

Many of these Chinese workers were treated very badly.

Very little is known about the Chinese workers.

Stanford University wants to change that.

The school is trying to learn as much as possible about the men.

It has started something called the Chinese Railroad Workers in North America Project.

About 250 people came to Stanford University in early June.

They came to talk about the Chinese railroad workers.

Some were the great- or great-great-grandchildren of railroad workers.

They shared their family histories.

Barre Fong was at the June event.

Fong is a filmmaker.

He is working on a movie about the Chinese railroad workers.

The workers were just "nameless, faceless men" for him before, said Fong.

He learned much more about "who they were," he said.

Chin Lin Sou was one of the workers Fong heard about.

Chin learned to speak English perfectly.

He then opened a popular store in Denver, Colorado.

Hung Lai Woh was another of the workers.

Hung came over as a teenager.

He built sheds to protect the railroad tracks from heavy snowfall.

Later on he ran a store in San Francisco, California.

Sandy Lee is one of the people who spoke at Stanford in June.

She said her great-grandfather's work team was attacked by an American Indian tribe.

The tribe's chief had lost his son.

He took Lee's great-grandfather to live with him.

The young man was freed two years later.

He later became a farmer in Maryland.

Chinese railroad workers were treated very unfairly.

They got paid less than Irish railroad workers.

Other workers got money for food and housing.

The Chinese had to pay for their own food and homes.

Asians in the United States do not have those kinds of problems anymore.

Many are doing very well.

It is important to remember that things were not always so easy, Fong said.

The Chinese railroad workers had a very hard time, he said.

Fong hopes people will understand that the tough lives they had made it easier for people today.

Perhaps what Stanford is doing will help.
