They wander through museums and watch countless movies.

They read rare books and listen to unusual music.

The ideas behind their clothing can be so complicated they are hard to understand.

Fancy ideas are not always enough, though.

Often they do not make the clothes look any better.

Sometimes the best clothes are based on the designer's own life and feelings.

This week is an important time for clothing designers.

In New York City top designers are showing off their new clothes.

They are putting on special shows to introduce their new designs.

The week of special events is known as Fashion Week.

This year's designers have gotten their ideas from all over.

One collection was based on the life and music of 1960s jazz singer Nina Simone.

Another was based on the buildings of Frank Lloyd Wright.

However, some of the most beautiful clothes reflected the designer's own experiences.

Prabal Gurung's collection of clothing was a strong example of this.

Garung grew up in Nepal.

Earlier this year, that country was hit by a terrible earthquake.

Many people were killed.

Ancient buildings crumbled to the ground in ruins.

Most of Nepal's people are Buddhists.

Buddism is a religion started in Asia.

Some men and women spend their lives studying and teaching Buddhism.

The men who do this are known as monks.

They wear special reddish-orange and yellow robes.

On Sunday night Garung opened his show with a group of monks singing.

They sang slowly and peacefully.

Their singing was a way of saying a prayer for Nepal and its people.

When they had finished, they left silently.

Then, the show's music switched on.

Soon, the first fashion models appeared.

They had on flowing dresses colored orange, yellow and red.

The dresses were the same colors as the robes the monks wore.

2015 has been a difficult year for Gurung, who grew up in Nepal.

Like all Nepalese, he was very upset by the 2015 earthquake.

He still has family and friends back in Nepal.

The country and its people need help badly.

"Saturday, April 25, 2015 changed my life forever," he wrote in the show notes.

Gurung set out to raise money to help Nepal.

So far, he has raised more than $613,000.

As he tried to raise money, Gurung began thinking back to his early life in Nepal.

He remembered the sights, sounds and smells.

Soon he decided to make clothing that would say something about Nepal and about his feelings.

He wanted to show the world what his country was about and how much it meant to him.

The clothes he ended up making are beautiful.

They also say something about how important Nepal is to him.

In some ways the show was Gurung's way of saying "thank you" to those who have supported Nepal, and him.

It did not matter that most people at the show knew little about Nepal.

Gurung made the country and its people feel familiar.

The show was not just about beautiful clothes.

It was also emotional.
