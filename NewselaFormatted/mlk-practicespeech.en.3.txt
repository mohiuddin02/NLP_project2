Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. was a famous speaker.

His words are an important part of American history.

King was also a leader in fighting for equal rights for African-Americans.

He gave his well-known "I Have a Dream" speech to hundreds of thousands of people in Washington, D.C., in 1963.

Before he made this speech, however, he gave a very similar speech in front of a smaller crowd.

King delivered this 55-minute speech in 1962.

He spoke in front of a small audience and reporters in a high school gymnasium in Rocky Mount, North Carolina.

The speech was recorded.

Until recently, no one could find the audio tape with the recording of the speech.

That all changed thanks to an English professor named Jason Miller.

Miller found the old tapes in a local library During the speech at Rocky Mount, King said "I have a dream" eight times.

He was speaking to about 2,000 people.

He gave the speech at Booker T. Washington High School.

This was eight months before he made his famous speech in Washington, D.C. People who study King's history think the Rocky Mount speech helped prepare King for the famous remarks.

Miller did not plan to find the tape recording.

In fact, he was in the middle of researching for a book that he was writing.

During his research, he read an article in an old newspaper about the first speech.

He realized there was probably a recording somewhere as well.

It wasn't easy to track down the recording once he learned it was out there.

Miller sent many emails and made calls.

He reached out to other history researchers.

In the fall of 2013, he finally heard back from the Braswell Public Library in Rocky Mount.

They offered the clues Miller needed.

Staff at the library told Miller that a box with the recording had mysteriously appeared on a desk one day.

They did not know much about the box.

Handwriting on the box described it as a recording of King's speech.

Miller compared the recording from the library to King's speech in Washington, D.C.

He learned new facts about King's style.

First, he listened to the Rocky Mount recording.

Then he read the script King used for his Washington, D.C., remarks.

Miller realized the famous "I have a dream" section was not in the typewritten script King read in Washington, D.C. Miller and other historians think King improvised the dream phrases in Washington, D.C.

He likely did not plan to talk about the dreams in Washington, D.C., but because he practiced in Rocky Mount, King was prepared.

Miller played the recording for the public recently.

Three people who were in the audience for King's 1962 Rocky Mount speech had the chance to hear it.

Herbert Tillman remembers it well.

He was 17 years old at that time in 1962.

Tillman said King's words were encouraging.

He remembers the crowd listening closely.

The town of Rocky Mount really needed to hear King's inspiring speech during that time, Tillman said.

Now the public can listen to the recording, too.

King's speech encourages African-American people to fight for the same rights as white people.

King tells listeners to push for the right to vote.

He also says the crowd must push for change in their communities.

King realized this was hard to do.

He knew it was important, though, and he inspired his listeners to do so.
