Mark Zuckerberg runs Facebook.

He helped start the company when he was a in college.  Facebook is used by billions of people around the world.

It has made Mark a great deal of money.

He is very, very rich.  Mark had some big news his week.

He said he and his wife will give away much of their money.

His wife's name is Priscilla Chan.

She is a doctor.

The two promised to give away around $45 billion.

The money will be used to help make schools better.

Mark said this on Facebook.

It was in a letter to his first child. Her name is Maxima Chan Zuckerberg.  Maxima was born in November.

Her mother and father call her Max for short.  Mark said it was time to start giving to others.

He and his wife want to help all children be the best they can be.

Mark and Priscilla said computers can make schools better.

They can help kids learn.

There are many new ideas on how to use computers and other technology.

The two said they "grew up in classrooms where we all learned the same things."

Some students learned more quickly than others.

Students were interested in different things.

Everyone learned the same things in the same way.  Teaching that way can be a problem, they said.

Some students do not do as well as they can.

Others are bored.

Technology can make teaching better, Mark and Priscilla said.

It makes teaching different for each student.

All kids learn in the way that is best for them.  The money Mark and Priscilla are giving away will help schools use new technology.

It will help them to do better in school.

Mark and Priscilla are also opening a free school for poor children.

The school will be in California.
