President Barack Obama has no choice.

If he wants to defeat the Islamic State group, he will have to become a real war leader.

He may not like it, but putting troops on the ground is the surest way to win this war.

That's nothing new.

Paris was horrific, but no game-changer.

The game changed in 2014, when the Islamic State broke out from Syria, drove the Iraqi military from the field and proclaimed a worldwide caliphate — a giant country ruled by Islamic law.

The moment the group, also known as ISIS, established a territorial state in Iraq, it posed two grave threats to the United States and its friends and allies.

A state in the heart of the Middle East controlled by Sunni extremists was guaranteed to create friction that will lead, inevitably, to a larger regional conflict with far-reaching spillover consequences.

The refugees flooding Europe and Moscow's deepening of its direct involvement in the fighting in Syria foreshadow what lies ahead.

The second threat was transnational.

With tens of thousands of foreign fighters and sophisticated social networking, Islamic State already had a global reach.

Its conquering of territory rich in oil made it the wealthiest militant organization in history.

Since then, Islamic State has demonstrated the capacity to adapt and innovate, combining the most effective terror practices developed by extremist groups over the last three decades.

Nonetheless, beyond capability, what really makes the Islamic State scary is its intent.

To sustain its narrative as a true caliphate, Islamic State must live up to its image as a powerful and growing force.

And the most effective way to do that is to take the battle to its enemies via transnational terror attacks.

It is folly for the administration to claim that these twin dangers — regional and transnational — are contained.

They are unfolding across Europe and, most dramatically, in Paris as America watches.

Clearly, our strategy for dealing with the Islamic State has been insufficient.

The Islamic State has been tough, absorbing months of drone attacks and light bombing.

Russia's entry into the war has helped prop up Syrian President Bashar Assad and perpetuated further conflict.

Still, it has not driven Islamic State from the field.

While ISIS has seen some tactical reversals, like when the ethnic Kurds recently took back the city of Sinjar, it has bounced back from every setback.

At this point, the United States should not try to solve Syria.

As long as Russia and Iran back Assad, he will stick around — as will the war against him.

Moreover, it's not reasonable for the United States to lead in the fight to hit Islamic State everywhere.

But where the United States could lead is in breaking Islamic State's territorial control of Iraq — and that's a task worth doing because commanding a state is what makes the group a global threat.

Without U.S. participation, the prospects for a successful conventional war against ISIS are slim.

Arab states lack both the capacity and expertise to undertake these operations.

The Kurds can defend themselves and even regain territory, but liberating the country is beyond them.

The Iraqi military is far from ready.

Neither Sunnis nor Shiite are ready to risk an all-out war with ISIS.

European countries don't have the means to carry out major operations on the ground in the Middle East without the United States standing by their side.

Additionally, after conventional forces drive ISIS from the field, they will have to keep them from coming back until Iraq is politically stable enough to stand up to external security threats.

This is unwelcome news for a president who boasted of ending the war in Iraq and withdrawing U.S. troops.

But the absence of U.S. boots on the ground changed the facts on the ground as well, and Islamic State was quick to take advantage.

Adding force bit by bit — 50 special ops troops here, a few more airstrikes there — cannot substantially alter the current unpleasant facts on the ground.

The delay of meaningful ground action risks allowing the twin dangers of the extremist group to spread even farther.

The response to the Paris terror attacks should not be military.

The desire for revenge is understandable.

French President Francois Hollande speaks of a war against the Islamic State group, just like U.S. President George W. Bush spoke of a war against al-Qaida after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks on the United States.

The threat stated by an Islamic State member, a day or two after the Paris attacks, to do something similar in Washington, D.C., only heightens the concern.

It makes it seem we must do something to destroy the extremist group, which is also called ISIS.

The problem is that a military effort to destroy Islamic State is not likely to work.

President Barack Obama understands that if he were to proclaim a goal of definitively eliminating ISIS in the short term, he would fail.

Then he would have to eat his words.

The use of force has gotten us into the fix in which we now find ourselves.

Our response to the attacks we suffered on Sept. 11 was military.

Our aim in invading Afghanistan in 2001 was to stop terrorism, but we seem only to have spawned more.

We did limit al-Qaida's ability to operate in Afghanistan, but they moved elsewhere, and the anger we generated may have brought even more down on us.

Our invasion of Iraq in 2003 replaced a government of Sunnis led by Saddam Hussein with a government of Shiites, the majority Muslim group in Iraq.

The Shiites then carried out a vendetta against the Sunnis for how Hussein had treated them.

While occupying Iraq, we worked to weed anyone who had supported Hussein out of their jobs.

That left the Sunnis thinking they had no role in the new Iraq.

The exclusion of the Sunnis spawned Sunni-led armed groups like Islamic State.

Rabbi Michael Lerner, a philosopher and expert on the Middle East, wrote after the Paris attacks, "Until the powerful countries of the world are seen as mainly driven by a desire to care for the well-being of everyone else on the planet and the well-being of the planet itself, and care not only out of self-interest but also out of a new consciousness in which we all come to truly understand our mutual interdependence and oneness, what we saw in Paris this past week is destined to be an increasing reality in the coming decades."

The response to the Paris attacks should be to set the West on a path to dealing with the Middle East.

We must do so in a way that undermines the anti-Western attitudes that lead to indiscriminate violence of the kind we saw on the streets of Paris.

The Paris attacks provide a new and compelling reason for the West to take action to undercut the negative sentiment about the West.

Among the various conflicts, one where we still have a chance to help is the one between Israelis and Palestinians.

The lack of a solution for that conflict, which has been festering for so long, bears a direct relation to the massacre in Paris.

The support of the Western powers, and particularly the United States, of Israel was a battle cry for Osama bin Laden when he first organized al-Qaida in the 1990s.

The Arab countries were unable to deal with Israel to secure a country for the Palestinians.

Bin Laden attracted the youth of the Middle East by telling them that violence was the only way to fight the West and to force Israel to accommodate the Palestinians.

Bin Laden successfully played on the view that the United States has been bought off by Israel to let it take over Palestinian land through its aggressive policy of building settlements on Palestinian land.

President Obama wisely is not buying into President Hollande's thinking.

Rabbi Lerner's approach shows a greater chance of achieving a long-term solution.

By positive policy changes, we must change the views that have generated terror attacks.
