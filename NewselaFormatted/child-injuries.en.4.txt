Almost 1 million children a year break a bone.

Most of them do not get the right treatment, says a new study.

If you break your arm, the doctor might put a splint on it.

The splint holds the bone in place.

The bone needs to stay steady so it can heal.

A splint is a straight object that sits next to the broken bone.

A bandage holds soft padding in place.

Many splints for children are put on incorrectly.

This can cause swelling or sores.

Broken bones could take longer to heal.

Joshua M. Abzug is a bone doctor in Maryland.

He studied 275 kids with broken bones.

He found most of them had a splint that was put on wrong.

"I didn't think it would be that high," Abzug said.

About four out of 10 kids had problems because of the splints.

In the United States, half of the boys break a bone before age 16.

One in four girls do.

Almost 1 million kids younger than 15 break an arm or leg each year.

The researchers have a plan.

They want to teach the right way to put on splints.

They will put up posters and give out cards as reminders.

Then they will redo the study.

They will see if their work made a difference.

Dr. Robert G. Graw Jr. is a doctor in Maryland.

He said kids and parents must be careful.

They should never take off a splint.

They might not put it back on correctly.

That may have happened with 1-year-old Hudson.

Hudson got hurt last month.

X-ray pictures showed a broken shinbone.

His leg was splinted in the hospital emergency room.

Once, he crawled out of his splint.

Another time, his mother took it off so he could sleep.

Hudson got a sore on his heel.

Now, the cast is off.

Hudson and his twin brother are learning to walk.

His mother feels terrible.

They should not have taken off the splint.

She worries it was her fault that Hudson took longer to heal.
