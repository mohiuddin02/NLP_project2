Scientists who followed bar-headed geese as they flew south for the winter across the world's tallest mountains found out that the birds don't fly in a straight line.

Instead, they climb up and sail down, following the shape of the ground.

The results of the scientists' study appeared in the journal Science.

They found that the geese use a very clever strategy to finish the trip south, from their breeding grounds in Mongolia to their winter homes in India and southeastern Tibet.

When it comes to seasonal migrations, the bar-headed goose is no slacker.

The study's authors wrote that birds face many obstacles when they migrate, such as crossing deserts and oceans.

But they added that only a few can fly across the high mountains between India and central Asia.

The bar-headed goose is one species that manages to cross the Himalaya Mountains, the study says.

The Himalaya Mountain range is in south Asia and contains some of the tallest mountains in the world, including Mount Everest.

The naturally talented flyers can reach great heights.

One goose was tracked flying as high as 4.5 miles for a short while.

But scientists have long argued about how high the birds actually fly, and how on earth they manage to do it.

Many scientists thought the geese would fly to the top of the mountains and stay at that height.

They thought he birds would not waste energy dropping down and flying back up again.

To find out, a team of scientists from Bangor University in Wales needed to collect data from the birds during flight.

So some bar-headed geese were hooked up with instruments to measure body temperature, pressure, speed and heart rate.

The scientists found that the birds did not fly in a straight line, the most direct route to their destination.

Instead, the geese would hug the terrain, climbing to get over a high peak and dropping when the ground leveled out.

This meant doing extra work to keep flying upward, over and over again.

In one stretch over 15 hours, the geese rose and fell repeatedly.

They climbed almost 4 miles and dropped a little over 3 miles, rising less than 1 mile in total.

It seemed like a lot of extra flying for very little gain, but it is the best way to travel.

The scientists found that if the birds had gone up in a straight line, they would have used 8 percent more of their energy while flying.

The reason is probably because flying at great heights can be very tiring.

The air is thinner at higher altitudes, so the birds' wings have less air to push against and it takes more work to get anywhere.

The higher the birds flew, the more they had to beat their wings, and the more they beat their wings, the harder their hearts had to work.

Flapping their wings 5 percent more made their hearts beat 19 percent faster.

In the end, it seems to be better for the birds to fly low when they can, and fly high when they have to.

Wind drafts that flow upward in the mountains help give them a lift.

In fact, some of the highest flights recorded have been at night, when the air is colder and thicker, making it easier to fly through.

Bar-headed geese are heavier than 98 percent of most bird species, the study's authors wrote.

So it is very interesting to see that birds their size can manage to migrate across the world's tallest mountains.
