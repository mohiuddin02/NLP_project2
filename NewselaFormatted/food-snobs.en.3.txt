It can be less enjoyable to eat lettuce that is a few days old.

It is not as crisp as it was when it was first pulled from the ground.

Eating zucchini that is a few days old is not bad.

But fresh zucchini would be better.

A new university study found that Americans are pretty picky about what gets to stay in their refrigerators.

The study came out last week.

One of the most common excuses for tossing out food is that people "want to eat only the freshest food."

The other common reason is a fear of food poisoning.

The study listed the most common excuses in order of popularity.

Many people feel comfortable throwing out food that is probably still good to eat.

They can afford to buy more food.

People wanting to eat better can be a good thing.

It has made people appreciate fruits and vegetables more.

Their love for food makes them willing to pay a bit more for food.

They give more money to smaller farms and less to giant food companies.

Yet caring too much about freshness can also be a very bad thing.

Some people throw away perfectly good foods.

They do not think the foods are fresh enough anymore.

The amount of food that goes to waste in the United States has increased.

In 2012, Americans threw out about 35 million tons of food.

It was almost one-fourth more food than we threw away in 2000.

Roughly half of all food waste comes from families.

It does not come from businesses, like restaurants.

When foods are sold in stores, they sometimes have warnings about freshness.

The warnings can make people extra worried about food going bad.

Studies have shown that this might cause a problem.

This new study says that many people worry about food poisoning.

It also suggests that food snobbery is not helping.

There are good reasons to throw away food.

Just saying, "This apple is less than perfect," is not one of them.
