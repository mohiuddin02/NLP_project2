It's been the driest winter in many years in California.

And there are a lot of strong feelings about water in the state.

It's up the state water board to decide what to do with the state's scarce water.

No one sounds very happy about its decisions.

"This year is a whole new level of crazy," said Ara Azhderian.

He is with a farming group.

The farmers probably won't get water for farming this year.

The Sacramento and the San Joaquin are the state's two longest rivers.

The two rivers are the main water supply for 3 million acres of farmland.

They also supply water to 25 million people.

But it's a balance.

The fresh water from the rivers must flow out into the Pacific Ocean.

Otherwise, saltwater from the ocean will flow into the area.

It would make the water salty.

Salty water would spoil the water for people, farms and wildlife.

The question is this: How much water should flow to the ocean and how much should be used for farms and drinking water?

No one agrees.

Farmers say too much water has been allowed to escape to the ocean.

They say they do not have enough water to grow their crops.

Wildlife groups, though, say farmers are getting too much water.

They worry the rivers will salt up.

Then the fish and wildlife will suffer.

In February and March, it finally rained.

This was after two months of sunny, dry weather.

The storms caused the river levels to rise.

And the fight over the extra water was on.

"This is a big one," said Les Grober.

He is with the Water Resources Control Board.

The board decides what to do about the water.

"We get many issues before us.

But this is a very dry year.

People are very worried."

People are very concerned about their communities, said Janet McCleery.

She lives in Discovery Bay.

"We're just trying to protect our home and life," she wrote.

She'd like to save both the fish and the farms.
