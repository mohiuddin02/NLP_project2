Misty Copeland has become the first black ballerina to become a principal dancer at American Ballet Theatre (ABT).

On Tuesday, she was promoted to the top role.

Copeland, 32, is one of America's most famous female athletes.

She is respected and admired for her rise in an art world that usually features only slim white ballerinas.

Her star power has stretched far beyond dance.

Copeland wrote a popular book about her life.

She was on the cover of Time magazine's "100 Most Influential People" issue.

She also starred in an Under Armour ad that went viral on the Internet.

The ad showed her twirling.

In the background, a woman's voice read a letter declaring she has "the wrong body for ballet."

"Bringing on Misty Copeland is the best decision we've ever made," said Adrienne Lofton.

She is a top executive for Under Armour, the sportswear company.

"We've always had powerful female athletes," Lofton said.

The company has never hired an athlete like Copeland, though.

She shows "men, women and kids that athletes come in all shapes and sizes."

Copeland's new position will start August 1.

Copeland has performed many starring roles recently.

She danced the female leads in the ballets "Romeo and Juliet" and "Firebird."

Earlier this spring, Copeland danced the lead role in "Swan Lake."

It was an important moment in American arts.

Copeland became the first black woman to dance the ballet's white swan.

From the moment tickets went on sale, all of her performances were sold out.

"I haven't come from the typical path or background of someone who would make it to this level as a ballerina," she said at the time.

Copeland grew up in a single-parent home.

Her mother struggled to support the family.

Copeland said her mother gave her and her siblings the strength "to just continue to survive and succeed."

When she was 13, Copeland took her first dance class.

She was inspired by a television movie about Olympic gymnast Nadia Comaneci.

She began dancing late for a young ballerina.

She weighed more and was more muscular than most ballerinas.

Still, she rose to become the American Ballet Theatre's second-ever black soloist, at age 24.

A soloist is second in rank to a principal dancer.

Copeland's popularity quickly grew beyond the world of ballet lovers.

She has starred in Dr Pepper and BlackBerry ads.

She performed in concert with the musician Prince.

She also was a judge on Fox television's "So You Think You Can Dance."

Copeland has also written an illustrated children's book, "Firebird."

It was named for one of her first big roles with the American Ballet Theatre.

Most people have seen her in Under Armour commercials.

Under Armour said the ads are the  most successful in its history.

Lofton, who is with the company, said that many women became interested in Under Armour clothing because of Copeland.

Her Under Armour commercial has been viewed more than 8 million times on YouTube.

Copeland has more than 500,000 followers on Instagram and Twitter.

Copeland last year told the sports network ESPN that Under Armour pays her more than she makes as a ballerina.

Her company's soloists make between $50,000 and $100,000 a year.

On social media, the congratulations poured in for Copeland from companies, the ballet community and fans.

Among them was television celebrity Star Jones.

She wrote that she was "crying tears of joy for @mistyonpointe and all the little girls she will inspire," referring to Copeland by her Twitter handle.

Still, Copeland said it is important for her to do her best.

"Every time I step onto the stage, it's not only proving to the audience that I'm capable, but to myself."
