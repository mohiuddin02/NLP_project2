In January 1964, President Lyndon Johnson declared "all-out war on human poverty and unemployment in these United States."

The War on Poverty has lessened some amount of economic despair since then.

But many of the states that were among the poorest decades ago remain so today, even as safety-net programs have benefited millions of Americans.

The average poverty rate among the states was 24 percent in 1959.

But some were in much worse shape than others: Mississippi's rate, for example, was 55 percent back then.

The rate in Arkansas was 48 percent, and in South Carolina it was 45 percent.

Fifteen states had official poverty rates of 30 percent or higher, according to the 1960 U.S. Census.

That year, the official federal poverty level was an annual household income of $2,973 for a family of four, or $23,800 in today's dollars.

By 2012, the average poverty rate among the states had plummeted to 14 percent.

But some states stand out, according to a Stateline analysis, and many are the same problem states from 1959: Mississippi still has the nation's highest poverty rate, at 22 percent.

Arkansas also remains above average at 20 percent.

Other states, such as New Mexico and Louisiana, had above-average poverty rates in 1959 but have fallen further behind in the years since.

In 2012, New Mexico and Louisiana had the second- and third-highest poverty rates under the current standard, which is household income of less than $23,492 for a family of four.

Experts say that in some regions, the same factors that caused poverty decades ago persist today.

Among them are a less-educated workforce, lower rates of health insurance, low participation rates in safety-net programs and long distances to major cities and metropolitan areas with plentiful jobs.

"You have these persistently poor regions," said James P. Ziliak, director of the Center for Poverty Research at the University of Kentucky.

"There has been some catch-up over the decades," he said.

"It just hasn't been enough."

Some states that were better off in 1959 remain so today.

Connecticut's poverty rate in 1959 was 9.6 percent, the only state below 10 percent.

In 2012, its rate was 10.3 percent — no longer lowest in the nation (New Hampshire, at 8 percent, held that distinction), but among the lowest.

Others have seen vast improvement: Minnesota's 1959 rate was 19 percent, for example.

Today it's 10 percent.

Stateline analyzed once-every-10-years poverty data from the 1960, 1970 and 1980 surveys by the U.S Census Bureau, which puts out data on the U.S. population.

Stateline then looked at state-by-state poverty levels from 1980 to 2012 from a government survey.

The Census Bureau's official poverty rate is based solely on income.

It doesn't factor in the cost of living, which differs significantly from state to state.

Nor does it include the effect that tax benefits and safety-net programs — some with roots in the War on Poverty — can have on a household's bottom line.

A supplemental measure the Census began using recently paints a fuller picture.

It factors in cost of living and the availability of government assistance.

Nationally, it shows a similar poverty rate, but some states with low official rates have a higher rate under the supplemental measure.

California, with its high cost of living, is worst at 24 percent by the supplemental measure, more than 7 percentage points higher than its official rate.

New Jersey and Florida also see their poverty rates jump by more than 4 percentage points, to 18 percent and 20 percent, respectively.

Even with this adjustment, some of the same states that had elevated levels of poverty in 1959 are still poor.

Taken together, the dual measures paint a complicated picture of the effects of the War on Poverty.

An analysis of Census data from the Pew Research Center found the South still has the largest share of poor Americans: 41 percent in 2012, compared to 46 percent in 1969.

The Midwest's share declined from 23 percent in 1969 to 19 percent in 2012 and the Northeast's share dropped from 17 percent to 16 percent.

The biggest change has been in the West, which had 15 percent of poor Americans in 1969 but 24 percent of them in 2012.

Louisiana and Georgia, for example, each had official poverty rates of nearly 40 percent in 1959.

They continue to have elevated levels today, by both Census measures.

A few factors could explain why: The two states rank in the top 10 nationally for share of population under 65 years old without health insurance, according to Kaiser Family Foundation data.

Both states also have slightly lower education levels for residents than the national average, according to Census figures.

On the other hand, some of the states that were poorest in 1959 and today appear much better under the supplemental measure.

This underscores how safety-net programs can keep families out of poverty.

Mississippi's nation-leading official poverty rate of 22 percent in 2012 falls to 16 percent under the supplemental measure.

New Mexico's 20 percent drops to 16 percent under the supplemental standard, while Arkansas' 20 percent falls to 17 percent.

Poverty experts and advocates for the safety net give credit to programs that prop up family incomes.

The Census, for example, has said 5 million more Americans would have been considered poor in 2012 without food stamps, a program that was part of the War on Poverty, not to mention other safety-net benefits.

"We're doing the best we can to fight poverty, and we're doing a pretty good job," said Timothy Smeeding, director of the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin.

He says that debates about the War on Poverty should focus on the broader measure and benefits of the safety net.
