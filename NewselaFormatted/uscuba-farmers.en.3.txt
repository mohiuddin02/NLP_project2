Joe Mencer is a rice farmer.

He wants to ship the rice he grows in Arkansas to Cuba and sell it there.

First, he needs the government to change a law.

In the 1960s, Cuba's government and the United States government did not get along.

Cuba was led by Fidel Castro, and the American government did not trust him.

To punish Cuba, the United States decided to stop trading with the country.

This continued until the year 2000.

Then, Obama announced earlier this year he would try to make it easier to trade with Cuba again.

This way, Americans would be allowed to travel to Cuba.

American businesses would also be able to sell things to Cuba.

Still, right now trading with Cuba is very limited.

Obama will need the help of lawmakers in Congress to make trade easier.

They will need to agree on passing a new law.

This is difficult.

Some people in Congress are Republicans and usually disagree with Obama.

Others are Democrats and typically agree with Obama.

Both groups have people who think the United States should trade with Cuba.

Both groups also have people who disagree.

The lawmakers will need to discuss whether to create a new law.

It could take a very long time.

If trade was allowed, rice could get from Arkansas to Cuba in one week.

Cuba is not far from Arkansas.

It is off the coast of Florida.

Right now, though, most of the rice in Cuba comes from Vietnam.

The Asian country is 11,000 miles away.

Rice takes six weeks to make the trip.

Farmers know that there are 11 million people in Cuba.

It could be a lot of business.

It also could help Cuba.

The small country does not have enough farms to feed its people.

It also does not have much cash to buy food.

Right now, one problem is that Cuba is not spending much on goods from the United States.

Frozen chicken is the most common food the United States sends to Cuba.

No rice is sold to Cuba, though.

This frustrates Joe Mencer.

He knows Cubans eat more rice per person than Americans.

Mencer is 55 years old.

He has grown rice for years.

"I keep hoping I'll be able to sell some of it to Cuba," he said.
