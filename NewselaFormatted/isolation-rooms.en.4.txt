Kari Knudtson's 10-year-old son sometimes acts out in school.

He does not have good behavior.

One day, he lost control in class.

His teacher could not calm him down.  Then he was sent to the school's isolation room.

The isolation room is a quiet space where misbehaving students are sent.

Kids spend time alone in the isolation room.

After they calm down, they can go back to class.  Not all schools have isolation rooms.

Those that do say the rooms can keep schools safe.

The rooms can help students relax.

They also keep the student from putting others in danger.

However, not everyone thinks schools should use isolation rooms.  Some parents complain about the rooms.

They say the school uses them to punish students.

Schools should find other ways to deal with a student who is acting out, they say.

Knudtson's son goes to Mill Creek Elementary in Missouri.

The isolation room at his school is an empty room.

It has a door that leads into it.

Students are not locked inside.  Still, many parents are unhappy.

They want Mill Creek to stop using the isolation room.

Joni Gentry is one of those people.

She has a fifth-grader at Mill Creek.

"We didn't need them in the past, why do we need them now?"

she said.

This is not the first time people have wondered about isolation rooms.

In 2012, a Washington public school held a second-grader in a padded closet.

The school called it an isolation room.

Many parents were upset that a young child was held in such a small space.  Last year, schools in Texas held kids in isolation spaces, too.

The rooms were very small.

One was about the size of a parking space.

Mill Creek Elementary parents are fighting back.

Many parents are unhappy.

They want the school to stop using the room.
