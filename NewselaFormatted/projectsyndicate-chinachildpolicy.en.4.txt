NDON, England – Years ago, China created a rule.

Families could only have one child.  China is a large country in Asia.

In the 1970s, the country was growing.

Families were having lots of children.

The government became worried that the country was going to get too crowded.

Would there be enough food?

The "one-child" rule was made to keep the number of people down.  The rule caused many problems, though.

This year, the rule has changed.

Now, families can have two children.  The rule will change the country in several ways.

For one thing, there will soon be more young people in China.

The one-child rule reduced the number of young people in China.

For years, there was only one child for every two parents.

Over time, old people started to outnumber young people.

The Chinese people, overall, got older.

This caused many problems.

As people get old and stop working, they depend on young people.

In China, there were not enough young people. The new two-child rule will help fix that.

Eventually, it will make the ages of Chinese people more balanced.

The new rule will help in other ways, as well.

It will allow families to have two children instead of just one.

As a result, it will probably cause many families to spend more money. After all, it costs money to care for a child.  Right now, Chinese families save a lot of their money.

It would help China if people started spending more.

More spending helps businesses.

For example, car makers are happy when people spend more money buying cars.

Businesses will be happy with the new two-child rule.

At first, the higher number of children will mean that more children's books, toys, and bicycles are sold.

As the kids get older, other businesses will be happy too.
