Binod Tiwari stopped in front of a foot-wide crack in the street.

As trucks and motorcycles whizzed by, Tiwari raised his camera to take pictures.

The engineer then checked some homes nearby that were tipping over.

Tiwari came to Nepal to help lead a U.S. team that measures the damage after big earthquakes.

Nepal is a country between India and China.

In April, a huge earthquake hit Nepal.

Tiwari was born in Nepal, so he was especially eager to see the damage caused by the quake.

The team wanted to find out what happened to the rock and soil during the quake.

It also looked at which buildings, bridges and roads made it through the quake, and which ones did not make it.

The best way to learn how to build safer buildings is to head to disaster zones and see which ones fell, Tiwari said.

"Natural disasters come without telling us," said Tiwari.

"Science has to chase that disaster."

Tiwari studies soil liquefaction.

This sometimes happens during earthquakes.

It causes the soil to move like a liquid, tipping over buildings as if pulling the rug out from under them.

Across Nepal, the team saw people huddled under tents.

Nearby were flattened and crumbling houses.

It's "devastating," Tiwari said.

"You want to cry."

Tiwari's ability to speak with Nepalese people was important.

He chatted in Nepali with a government official.

Tiwari was also able to ask people for details on what happened during the quake.

The scientists needed to work fast.

Soon the summer monsoon rains would come and erase evidence from the earthquake.

Tiwari's team examined every bridge, road, house and building they came across.

They also looked at how different types of soil reacted to the earthquake.

In part, they hoped to see which mountain slopes had a high risk of landslide.

They wanted to find those weaknesses now to have a better idea of which slopes would crumble during the summer rains.

Whether a building survives an earthquake partly depends on soil.

This includes what the soil is made of and the grain size, how densely packed it is, and how much water the soil holds.

Later in the day, Tiwari climbed under a metal gate.

He took a look at a three-story school that had sunk into the ground.

School officials had built it to withstand an earthquake with a magnitude of 8.0.

Magnitude measures how strong an earthquake is on a 1 to 10 scale.

It should have withstood April's quake which had a magnitude of 7.8.

Yet, no one checked the soil underneath it when it was built, Tiwari said, shaking his head.

Tiwari and his team were on the road May 12 when an aftershock of magnitude 7.3 hit.

Their car swayed as if rocked by ocean waves.

It was like "some big elephant coming to your car and shaking the car," Tiwari said.

They did not even think of turning back.

The aftershock gave them the chance to see the damage just hours after a major earthquake hit.

There was a lot of damage near the center of the aftershock.

Homes made with mud and bricks had fallen apart, and several buildings were flattened.

Tiwari said scientists will have to study the soils in different areas of Nepal.

They need to fully understand where it's safe to build.

Years ago, right after graduating from college, Tiwari built his own house in Nepal.

He designed it so well that it survived the quake.

His mother still lives there, but she and terrified neighbors refused to return to their homes.

They lived together in a tent for weeks as aftershocks continued.

Tiwari knew he could not leave Nepal until he had examined the buildings himself.

Tiwari checked everyone's house and told them, "Don't worry, go back to your house and sleep well there," Tiwari said.

"And they did, they did."
