In June, a volcano in Hawaii erupted.

When a volcano erupts, it explodes.

Lava started pouring out of the volcano.

Lava is melted rock from inside the Earth.

The burning hot lava is moving slowly to the ocean.

Pahoa is a small town.

In two weeks, the lava will cross Pahoa's main road.

Then, people in Pahoa will have a big problem.

They will not be able to use the road.

There will be no way to get to the only supermarket.

The lava has slowed down.

But it keeps moving toward Pahoa.

Some people are not sure whether to leave.

Many worry the lava will change direction.

The waiting is hard to take.

"It speeds up.

It slows down.

It speeds up.

It slows down," said Paul Utes.

"It's not like any other event where it gets over with and you can move on."

Paul owns a restaurant.

It is near where the lava may cross the main road.

So far, the restaurant is safe.

But Paul could have big problems anyhow.

He does not know how supplies will reach his restaurant.

He does not know if customers will still come.

For now, Paul has a lot of customers.

People come to town to see the lava.

The lava is already changing life in Pahoa.

Jamila Dandini lives in Pahoa.

She is afraid Pahoa will be cut off.

Pahoa will be like "an island on an island," she said.

So far, the lava has burned only a few objects and a shed.

Still, many homes are there.

More buildings could be in danger.
