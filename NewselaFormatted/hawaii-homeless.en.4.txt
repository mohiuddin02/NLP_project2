Many homeless people move to Hawaii.

The islands are warm.

Homeless people do not have a place to live.

Many of them can sleep on the beach.

David Ige is the governor of Hawaii.

He is a leader in the state.

He said there are too many homeless people.

David said the government must help the homeless.

There were 300 people living in a camp.

They were told to leave.

Workers took down the camp.

The workers helped 125 people find a place to live.

Some people went to homeless shelters.

A shelter is a place where homeless people can stay for a short time.

Others moved into houses.

They are not sleeping in the streets anymore.

The homeless people are in a better place, the governor said.

Many families still need a house, though.

A new homeless shelter must be built soon.

Scott Morishige works with Governor Ige.

He helps homeless people.

A million dollars will be spent to help them, Scott said.

The money will buy a new shelter.

It will pay for a program, too.

It is called Housing First.

It will help homeless people find houses and jobs.

If they have jobs, they can make money to pay for a home.

Workers are building a new homeless shelter.

The rooms are made from big wooden shipping boxes.

The rooms fit two people.

Russ Wozniak helped to plan the shelter.

Each room has a window and a screen door.

It will be nice to sit outside, Russ said.

The shelter will be done in December.

People will be happy to live there.
