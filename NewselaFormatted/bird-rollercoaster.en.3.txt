Some geese in Asia are creating their own roller coaster.

They fly up and down with the wind across a giant mountain range.

Scientists followed bar-headed geese as they flew south for the winter across the Himalaya Mountains, the world's tallest.

Their study discovered that the birds do not fly in a straight line.

Instead, they climb up and sail down, following the shape of the ground.

The scientists wrote down what they discovered.

The results appeared in a magazine for scientists.

The geese were followed from their home in Mongolia, a country between China and Russia.

The study followed the birds to their winter homes in India and southeastern Tibet.

When it comes to flying south for the winter, the bar-headed geese are hard workers.

The scientists wrote that the birds face many challenges when they fly to a new place for the winter.

They cross deserts and oceans.

But the scientists added that only a few birds can fly across the high Himalayas between India and central Asia.

The bar-headed goose is one type of bird that can cross the Himalaya Mountains, the study says.

These naturally talented fliers can reach great heights.

One goose flew more than 4 miles high for a short while.

But it was not clear to scientists exactly how high the birds could fly or how they stayed at such heights.

Many researchers figured the geese would fly to the top of the mountains and stay there.

They thought the birds would not waste energy flying down and back up again.

To find out, scientists needed to watch the birds in the air.

They attached tools to the geese that would measure body temperature, speed and heartbeat.

The scientists found that birds did not fly in a straight line.

Instead, the geese would climb to get over a high peak and drop when the ground leveled out.

This meant doing extra work to keep flying over the mountains, over and over again.

In one stretch over 15 hours, the geese went up and down, over and over.

But they only climbed 1 mile over the mountains.

It seemed like a lot of extra flying to climb very little.

But the study found it to be the best way to travel.

If the birds had gone up in a straight line, they would have spent more energy making the trip.

That is probably because flying at great heights can be very tiring.

The birds have to flap their wings more because the mountain air is thinner.

Their wings have less air to push against.

They have to work harder to keep moving.

The higher the birds flew, the more they had to beat their wings.

The more they beat their wings, the harder their hearts had to work.

In the end, it seems to be better for the birds to fly low when they can, and climb to get over a tall peak.

The wind in the mountains helps to give them a lift.

In fact, some of the highest flights recorded have been at night.

The night air is colder and thicker, so it is easier for the birds to fly through.
