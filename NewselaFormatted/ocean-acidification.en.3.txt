Nearby are piles of hard black lava.

A Washington state oyster family built a 20,000-square-foot shellfish hatchery here.

They are half an ocean away from Seattle, on a green patch of island below a tropical volcano.

Changing acid levels in the ocean off the Pacific Northwest's coast left the Nisbet family no choice.

Carbon dioxide from burning gasoline and oil made seawater along Washington's coast deadly.

Slippery young Pacific oysters had stopped growing.

The same ocean water got sucked into an Oregon hatchery.

It killed larvae the family had bought to grow oysters from.

So the Nisbets decided they had to leave.

They took out loans and moved half their company 3,000 miles away.

"I was afraid for everything we'd built," Goose Point Oyster Co. founder Dave Nisbet said of the Hawaiian hatchery, which opened last year.

"We had to do something."

Oysters started dying by the billions along the Northwest coast in 2005.

They have been struggling ever since.

Scientists cautiously linked the deaths to falling ocean pH in 2008 and 2009.

But few outside the West Coast's $110 million industry believed it.

Low pH levels mean the water is more acidic.

"I don't care if you think it's the fault of humans or not," Nisbet said.

"If you want to keep your head in the sand, that's up to you.

But the rest of us need to get it together because we're not out of the woods yet on this thing."

About 3,200 people work for the industry in Washington.

It grows one-quarter of the nation's oysters.

The Nisbets bought 10 acres of tidelands near Bay Center in 1975.

They built their business over the years, one market at a time.

Sometimes Dave Nisbet's daughter Kathleen, now 27, came along.

She sipped a baby bottle and ate cookies while riding with her father.

The Nisbets eventually pieced together 500 acres of tidelands and hired 70 people.

For a long time, business was good — until, overnight, it suddenly wasn't.

In 2005, when no young oysters survived in Willapa Bay at all, farmers blamed the luck of nature.

After two more years with essentially no new oysters being born, panic set in.

Then things got worse.

By 2008, oysters were dying at Oregon's Whiskey Creek Hatchery.

It draws water directly from the Pacific Ocean.

The next year, it struck a Taylor Shellfish hatchery, which gets its water from Hood Canal.

Owners initially suspected bacteria, but shellfish died even when it wasn't present.

Whiskey Creek hatchery closed for weeks at a time.

Taylor Shellfish grew 60 percent fewer larvae.

The entire industry was on the edge.

Oyster growers worried that in a few years they wouldn't have any shellfish to sell.

Kathleen Nisbet did not like the idea that she might have to lay off people who had worked for her family since she'd been a baby.

And no one could tell them what was wrong.

Then the oyster growers met the scientists who study the ocean.

Dick Feely is ocean scientist who works for the government.

By the early 2000s, he was seeing a huge change off the West Coast.

Low pH water was natural when it was hundreds of feet below the surface.

But that acidic water was rising fast, and hitting the hatcheries.

The acidic water surfacing off Washington, California and Oregon came from CO2 that entered the sea 20 or 30 years earlier.

Even if gas and oil burning immediately stops releasing CO2, West Coast sea chemistry would worsen for almost as long before leveling off.

It would take 30 to 50 years before the worst of it reached the surface.

It wasn't until 2012 that Feely and a team from Oregon State University finally showed with certainty that acidification had caused the problem.

By then, the Nisbets had moved on.

They now had a hatchery in Hawaii.

It draws warm saltwater from underground.

The tiny oysters grow until they are big enough to produce shells.

Then they are mailed back to Washington and planted in Willapa Bay.

Kathleen Nisbet has one young son and a baby on the way.

It's been impossible for her not to think about her own next generation.

"I don't think that our government is recognizing that ocean acidification exists," she said, adding that she does not think people know how much it matters.

"They think ocean acidification ... no big deal, it's a huge ocean."

But over the next 10 years the world will have to make significant progress tackling this problem.

"We're living proof," Nisbet said.

"If you ignore it, it's only going to get worse.

Plain and simple: It will get worse."
