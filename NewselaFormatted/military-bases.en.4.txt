Soldiers in the military often live on military bases with their families.

One base is trying to become a happier place to live.

Camp Pendleton is a military base in San Diego, California.

There are some changes taking place there.

These changes are making life easier for military families.

The military has said it wants to help the families, not just the soldiers.

Still, a lot of people are concerned.

They are worried that Americans think the military has nothing to do with them.

In the last 20 years, the U.S. government closed 350 bases in America.

The people and jobs were moved to other larger bases.

Camp Pendleton is one example.

The government helps the bases with money.

It provides many of the jobs in the towns near the bases.

Still, some people are still worried about these camps.

Ron Bee is a professor in California, and he is worried.

Very few people join the military now.

He says most Americans do not even think about war and peace much.

He thinks that people believe the military will just fix problems on its own.

Steve Erie is also a professor.

He says Americans respect the military, even if they do not join it themselves.

Military families living at Camp Pendleton have their own ideas.

They like the new changes.

They think that the better living helps them with the troubles of war.

Jessica Konczal is 33 and lives on the base.

She says that the base is its own family.

"If you've had a hard day, you'll probably meet someone here who understands."

Jolene Bopp, age 25, also lives on the base.

She enjoys the many stores there.

She also likes the sense of safety for children.

Still, Bopp says that there are times when "you just need to get away."

Other people who live in the area think that life inside the base is not as separate as it appears.

Non-military people often go to the base to enjoy it.

Sometimes, they ride bicycles through the base.

Others play outdoor sports there on the weekends.

Chelsey Kurtz loves these changes.

She grew up on the base in the 1990s, when her father was in the military.

Now she is back.

"When my father was here, it was just a workplace," Kurtz said.

"Now it's a family place."
