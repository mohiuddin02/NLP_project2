Belen Sisa came to the United States from Argentina, a country in South America.

That was 15 years ago.

She is not happy with some words we use to talk about immigrants.

Immigrants are people who come to live in America from other countries.

The word alien is sometimes used for immigrants.

An alien is a person who lives in a country but does not have citizenship there.

Many are workers or students.

Some left their home countries for a better life.

Sisa said calling people aliens is not the way to show respect.

The word alien also means a being from outer space.

She said use of that word should stop.

Sisa may soon get her wish.

A new law has been suggested.

The law says that this word should be not be used by anyone in government.

Joaquin Castro is a lawmaker from Texas.

He came up with the law.

Eighty-seven lawmakers are behind it.

Groups that help immigrants are behind it too.

Lawmakers will still have to vote on it.

Roger Rocha Jr. is president of one of the largest groups for Latinos in the United States.

He said that calling someone an alien puts that person down.

He said the law is important to changing how Americans think about people who come to this country to live.

He said that most Americans like this idea.

There have been laws about hurtful words before.

In 2010 and 2012 laws were passed about better ways of describing people who were not well.

Almost everyone voted for them to pass.

Raul Grijalva is a lawmaker from Arizona.

He also supports the law.

He said using words like alien makes people feel "less than a full American."

Sisa said the word has touched her life.

When applying for a job, she was told she was an alien.

She was asked if she was even allowed to try for the job.

She said she knows there need to be words for all kinds of people.

Even so, she hopes that the law will get people to use words that show more respect.

"It would mean that we're taking a step forward," Sisa said.

Lawmaker Castro agreed.

"Words matter," he said.
