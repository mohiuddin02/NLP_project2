But the expert now says the stories were exaggerated.

Carlo Pedretti, director of the Leonardo center at the University of California in Los Angeles, said that he did not conclude the painting was by da Vinci.

In an interview, he said he told the owners of the painting that it was possible and the idea was worth studying.

Works of art are sold by dealers and their worth can go up depending on the reputation of the artist who made them and how many other works the artist has produced.

Paintings by Leonardo da Vinci are among the most rare and expensive in the world.

Most of his paintings, such as the Mona Lisa, are hanging in famous museums like the Louvre in Paris.

Police in Switzerland seized this painting, a portrait of a noblewoman named Isabella D'Este.

The Swiss took it as part of an investigation by the Italian government, which wanted to know if the painting had been taken out of the country illegally.

Many countries have laws against taking important works of art or historic items abroad without the government's permission.

When the Swiss police announced it had taken the painting, it said Pedretti had declared it was painted by da Vinci.

An Italian magazine had said the same thing in 2013 in an article that also teased art lovers with the idea of a new masterpiece.

Pedretti's name has been falsely connected to a claim he never made, said Alessandro Vezzosi.

That has set off a bidding war for the painting, said Vezzosi, the director of a museum dedicated to Leonardo da Vinci in his hometown of Vinci in Italy.

The Swiss police said the price of the painting has gone up since 2013, when it was first discovered that it existed.

In 2013, it was worth 95 million euros, or about $108 million.

When the police finally found it in a bank vault in Switzerland last summer, it was worth 120 million euros, or about $137 million.

Pedretti said he saw the painting years ago in Switzerland, after a lawyer for the owners contacted him.

He wrote a letter saying it had promising elements that pointed to da Vinci as the painter, such as the way the face was painted.

But he said he recommended that the owners run more tests before announcing they had found a Leonardo da Vinci painting.

Pedretti said people who say he recognized the painting are wrong.

He said he recognized the work was important to students of da Vinci's work.

Pedretti is convinced the painting is old and quite likely from da Vinci's lifetime, but some details were painted later.

Pedretti said the correct procedure for declaring the painting is authentic includes consulting with his colleagues.

Vezzosi said he does not see Leonardo de Vinci's hand in the work.

But he said it is possible "that underneath there are surprises, perhaps a drawing by Leonardo."

A drawing of Isabella D'Este by Leonardo da Vinci that hangs in the Louvre shows the painter associated with her.

Pedretti does not rule out that da Vinci may have contributed to the painting.

But he said that, even if da Vinci started painting the portrait, it was probably finished by one of his students.

Many artists in da Vinci's time had workshops with many artists working for them.

Leonardo da Vinci had a lot of interests and was busy studying mechanics and physics, said Pedretti.

"He didn't have time to stay and work on a painting," he said.
