Now they're saying it might be easier to look for them from space.

They are using satellites, which fly around the earth.

The satellites can take pictures.

One, in fact, spotted 55 whales hanging out in the waters off Argentina.

The whales are called southern right whales.

It turns out they're quite easy to spot from space, said Peter Fretwell.

He works with a group of scientists called the British Antarctic Survey.

The whales got the name because they were once considered the "right" whales to hunt.

They were so easy to hunt their numbers dropped to just 300 by the 1920s.

There had been 55,000 to 70,000 of them in the days before whaling.

They are large and slow.

They spend a lot of time relaxing near the top of calm ocean water.

But the reason they're easy to hunt makes them easy to find by satellite.

Fretwell wrote about using satellites in a paper for other scientists.

Fretwell argues that it's possible to track whales by satellite.

And, it's easier than traditional ways.

Standing on a bridge of a ship and looking out into the ocean costs a lot of money and takes more time, said Fretwell.

So does gliding over the water in an airplane.

Those ways of tracking whales are also often inaccurate.

Pictures taken by satellite are more correct.

They cover more of the water, he said.

If this works, he said satellites can be used to track other kinds of animals.

Fretwell and other scientists purchased a huge picture taken in September 2012 by the WorldView2 satellite.

It included a part of the Argentine coast where a lot of southern right whales live.

They have babies there.

They also raise their young there from July through November.

The researchers looked at the same picture in different wavelengths.

One was even able to see 50 feet under the ocean.

They were able to spot 55 shapes that were probably whales.

Another 22 were possibly whales.

They spotted another 13 whale-shapes underwater.

The pictures are far from clear.

The researchers say that using satellites is not perfect.

After all, it is possible that a group of birds or a large rock could be mistaken for a whale.

What looks like a single whale could really be a mother whale with a baby.

These uncertainties should go away with time, scientists say.

New satellites will take better pictures.

That will allow scientists to be more sure that what they're seeing are really whales, the paper said.

Scientists already have used satellites to count penguins and seals in Antarctica.

The key is not the size of the animal, he said.

It's more important how they stand out from what's around them.
