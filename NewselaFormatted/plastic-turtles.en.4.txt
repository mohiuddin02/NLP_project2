Scientists say half of the sea turtles on Earth have swallowed some kind of plastic.

Most seabirds have also eaten plastic.

This is not safe for the animals.

Qamar Schuyler is a scientist in Australia.

She says a lot of plastic is dumped in the ocean every year.

The waters on the East Coast of North America have a lot of plastic garbage.

Schuyler wanted to see how much plastic was hurting sea turtles.

She used math and science to find out.

Math helped Schuyler find out how likely a turtle was to find plastic in the ocean.

Then she used science.

She looked at sea turtles that had died.

She opened the turtles to see their stomachs and whether they ate any plastic.

Olive Ridley Turtles are one type of sea turtle.

They eat jellyfish and other floating animals in the ocean.

They had more plastic in their bodies than any other turtles.

Jellyfish and plastic bags can look similar in the water.

Olive Ridley Turtles are now in danger.

Many of them are dying.

Turtles can die from eating plastic.

Sometimes, turtles feel full after they have eaten plastic.

This can make them forget to eat.

They can starve from not eating enough proper food.

Schuyler says the world is making more and more plastic.

We are not making new ways to get rid of the plastic.

This causes the plastic to end up in places it should not be.

It ends up in nature.

Schuyler also worries about micro plastics.

These are tiny bits of plastic.

They can also get into the ocean.

Unless we do something, the problem will only get worse, Schuyler says.

Scientists say when there is less plastic in the water, less of it is eaten.

Schuyler says this gives her hope.

Schuyler says people can do more to help.

They can recycle more.

People can stay away from plastic water bottles and plastic bags.

These can be harmful to turtles and other sea creatures.
