Amaiya Zafar is a young girl in Minnesota who, like many her age, found a sport she loves and desperately wants to practice.

Through it, she hopes to learn more about herself and test just how good she can become.

For one, the sport Amaiya fell in love with is amateur boxing.

More significantly, she is a 15-year-old Muslim girl who is as devout as she is dedicated.

Amaiya wants to wear a hijab, a head covering for Muslim women, under her boxing headgear and uniform.

While it is nearly impossible for her to find opponents in her size and age group, the bigger roadblock is that international rules that govern the sport do not allow her to wear a hijab in competition.

Maybe, the 10th grader thinks, boxing rules should change with the times.

"I think the rules are old school," said Amaiya, who lives in Oakdale, Minnesota.

"I don't think there's anything wrong with getting them changed."

Her mother, Sarah O'Keefe-Zafar, believes the rule is now having consequences, which no one expected.

"I don't think they ever intended to exclude anybody from the sport," she said.

Against the odds for most young girls, Amaiya fell hard for boxing two years ago when she saw the ring at a gym.

Her father, Mohammad Zafar, suggested that she take up fencing, but that wasn't for Amaiya.

"I'll box before I'll fence," she told him.

And that was that.

He helped her to understand the finer points of the sport by showing her videos and teaching her about amateur boxing.

Finally, she stepped into a gym and then into the ring.

"Everyone was like, 'That's Amaiya.

She's the small one,'" she said.

Her parents, meanwhile, went from supportive to enthusiastic.

"When she first trained, I came into this as a mom and a nurse," O'Keefe-Zafar said, "but she was dedicated and trained for over a year without sparring.

And I watched her go from a timid little girl to a confident young person."

Amaiya faced opposition from some boys who did not think a girl could box, but eventually, she found acceptance in the ring.

"Now they're my team," she said.

And when Amaiya, one of three children in her family, takes a hit?

"I look at it as something I did wrong defensively," she said.

"I try to learn from it and focus a lot on defense."

Rules about a hijab are not the only obstacle in Amaiya's way.

She now stands 5 feet 1 inch tall and weighs 106 pounds.

She is always, she says, "the small one" at the gym.

There are not a lot of possible opponents for women to begin with, let alone those in her height and weight class.

In addition, opponents must be within two years of one another.

Then there is the hijab, since removing it is not an option for a girl who cares deeply about her religion.

International boxing rules say that she cannot cover her arms and her legs below the knees.

Amaiya would like to wear a long-sleeved shirt and leggings beneath her tank top and shorts.

USA Boxing has requested a provisional ruling from AIBA, the international boxing organization.

Until the AIBA gives its decision, Martino said there is only so much officials could do.

"We have 30,000 amateur boxers in the United States," Martino said.

"So if you make allowances for one religious group, what if another comes in and says we have a different type of uniform we have to wear?

You have to draw a line someplace."

Jaylani Hussein, executive director of Minnesota's Council on American-Islamic Relations, said that USA Boxing's appeal to AIBA was the right move.

"You know, I think we are looking for an opportunity for this young girl to get a chance to do what all young teenagers (do), especially girls who want to play in this unique sport boxing and the only difference is that she's a Muslim," Hussein said.

Amaiya is not the first athlete to fight to wear a hijab during sports.

In the spring of 2014, FIFA, the world soccer organization, lifted a ban on players wearing religious head coverings during games.

So the teen focuses on her training, because boxing is something that is always there for her.

"If I'm in a bad mood, emotional or having a bad day," Amaiya said, her mother will tell her to go to the gym.

While her mother says the family is "patient and hopeful" that AIBA will decide she can wear her hijab, Amaiya is taking her enthusiasm for the sport in another direction.

"I'm teaching a boxing class at the gym on Saturday mornings," she said, "and I have eight (students) wearing hijab in the class."
