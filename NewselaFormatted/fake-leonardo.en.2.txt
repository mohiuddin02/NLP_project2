But now people are doubting this story.

Carlo Pedretti, an art expert from the University of California in Los Angeles, said that story is wrong.

He said he did not conclude the painting was by Leonardo da Vinci.

Pedretti said he told the owners of the painting only that it was possible the painting was by da Vinci.

He said it needed to be studied more.

The prices of works of art can change depending on how famous the artist is.

Paintings by Leonardo da Vinci are very rare and expensive.

Most of his paintings, like the Mona Lisa, are in famous museums.

Police in Switzerland seized this painting, a portrait of a noblewoman named Isabella D'Este.

The Swiss took it as part of an investigation by the Italian government.

The Italians wanted to know if the painting had been taken out of their country illegally.

Many countries have laws against taking important works of art or historic items out of the country without the government's permission.

The Swiss police said Pedretti had declared the painting was done by da Vinci.

An Italian magazine had said the same thing in 2013.

That article also excited art lovers with the idea of a new masterpiece by da Vinci.

Those stories have created a bidding war and raised the value of the painting, said Alessandro Vezzosi.

He directs a museum dedicated to Leonardo da Vinci in his hometown of Vinci in Italy.

The Swiss police said the price of the painting has gone up since 2013, when it was first discovered that it existed.

In 2013, it was worth 95 million euros, or about $108 million.

When the police finally found it in a bank vault in Switzerland last summer, it was worth 120 million euros, or about $137 million.

Pedretti said he saw the painting years ago in Switzerland, after a lawyer for the owners contacted him.

He wrote a letter saying it had promising elements that pointed to da Vinci as the painter.

But he said he recommended that the owners run more tests before announcing it was painted by da Vinci.

Pedretti said people who say he recognized the painting are wrong.

He said he recognized the work was important to students of da Vinci's work.

Pedretti is convinced the painting is old and is quite likely from da Vinci's lifetime, but some details were painted later.

Pedretti said he would have to talk to other experts before deciding.

Vezzosi said the painting does not look like da Vinci's work.

But he said it is possible that there could be a drawing by da Vinci under the paint.

A drawing of Isabella D'Este by Leonardo da Vinci hangs in the Louvre Museum in Paris.

It shows the painter associated with her.

Pedretti does not rule out that da Vinci may have worked on the painting, but that it was probably finished by one of his students.

Many artists in da Vinci's time had workshops with lots of artists working for them.

Leonardo da Vinci had a lot of interests and was busy studying mechanics and physics, Pedretti said.

"He didn't have time to stay and work on a painting."
