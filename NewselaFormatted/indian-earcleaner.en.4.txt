Sayed Mehboob cleans ears for a living.

Not many people do that anymore.

Today Mehboob is sitting outside.

He is set up near a train station.

People hurry by without stopping.

Then a young man stops.

Mehboob smiles.

"Would you like me to clean your ear?"

Mehboob asks.

He points to a second chair.

The young man sits down.

Mehboob opens his bag and takes out a tool.

First he puts soft cotton around its end.

Then he sticks the end in the man's ear.

He cleans the outside part first.

Next he cleans the inside of the ear.

A regular ear cleaning is just 30 cents.

A super cleaning is 80 cents.

The super cleaning comes with a bit of cream.

Mehboob says the cream is good for ears that hurt.

Mehboob has been cleaning ears for more than 20 years.

He makes around 20 dollars a week.

Most of the people who come to him are old.

Sometimes he even goes to their homes.

Ear cleaning on the streets goes back a long time ago.

It started during the 1700s.

Most people who clean ears are from the south of India.

Once there were many ear cleaners.

Mumbai's air is dirty so ears get dirty too.

These days the work is disappearing.

There are only a few ear cleaners left in Mumbai.

Most people clean their own ears now.

They just buy Q-tips.

Doctors tell people not to get their ears cleaned on the street.

They say people could get hurt.

Even so, Mumbai still has some ear cleaners.

Soon there will be one more.

Mehboob told his nephew how to do the work.

What about the doctors?

Mehboob says people should not listen to them.

Doctors just want to make more money, he says.
