<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20131024_Roma.jpg" /> BERLIN â€” Earlier this month, 15-year-old Leonarda Dibrani was grabbed by French police while she was on a school field trip.

Her crime?

The French government had just turned down her immigrant family's request to remain in France.

It claimed it couldn't wait until the end of the school day to get her out of the country.

Police escorted her off a bus filled with her classmates and whisked her away.

She and her family were quickly expelled to Kosovo, a country where Leonarda had never lived.

Many believe the real reason the police acted with such speed was the girl's ethnicity, or family background.

She is Romani, or to use the more common and insulting word, a Gypsy.

Experts say that harsh treatment of Roma people is all too common.

They are one of the last ethnic groups in Europe it is still widely acceptable to insult and mistreat.

The Roma originated in northern India, but have lived in Europe since the 1300s.

A recent report by the charity group Oxfam called them the most "deprived ethnic group within Europe."

Romani, the report said, are discriminated against when it comes to jobs, education, and health care.

Leonarda Dibrani's story at first took a surprising turn.

Hundreds of French students and others flooded the streets of Paris to support her.

They demanded that she be allowed to return.

Many thought that European views on Roma people might at last begin to change.

But such hope disappeared within days.

A Greek Roma family was accused of kidnapping a young blond girl.

Whether they really had kidnapped her or not, the case created a lot of anger.

Human rights lawyer Claudia Tavani said the recent European economic crisis has increased discrimination against the Roma.

When times are tough, people want someone to blame.

The Roma are an easy target.

In Slovakia, city governments build walls around what they call Gypsy camps.

In the Czech Republic, neo-Nazis lead protests against their presence.

In Romania, a right-wing political party recently offered cash to any Roma woman who would get sterilized.

In France, Gilles Bourdouleix, a member of Parliament, this summer said of the Roma: "Maybe Hitler didn't kill enough of them."

Hitler's Nazi Germany killed between 250,000 and 500,000 Roma.

But people in Germany hardly stopped hating them after World War II.

Romani Rose is head of a Roma council in Germany.

Standing next to a year-old memorial to Romani victims of the Nazis, he said the hate remains widespread.

His people still endure racism and discrimination, he said.

They are the last people in Europe to be hired and first to be fired.

He said poor villagers come to Berlin and find only overcrowded apartments.

Crooked landlords overcharge them for a mattress on the floor.

"Such overpopulation leads to conflicts with the neighbors," he said.

Then unfairness and hate from the past return, he said.

Cordula Simon, a Berlin government official, is eager to help Romani immigrants.

Europeans, she said, view the Roma people either as "happy dancers and fiddlers or as dangerous criminals."

But actually "they are just people" like anyone else.

And there are "many positive stories to tell.

Too few are willing to listen, however."

One of the most positive stories, she said, involves education.

Young Roma children, many from desperately poor rural areas of Romania and Bulgaria, arrive in Berlin schools extremely unprepared.

Many have never been to school before.

"But their energy level, their hunger to learn, is enormous," she said.

And it's moving to see how much Roma parents will sacrifice to give their children a better life, she added.

Mitek is a 37-year-old Roma immigrant from Bulgaria.

He lost a job and could find no new work at home, so he left his wife and children behind and came to Berlin, hoping for a better life.

What he has found to this point isn't much.

Every day he's out searching for used plastic bottles to return for money.

But sometimes he sits and thinks about the good life to come.

And he still believes, even though for the last six months his "home" has been a scrap-wood hut inside an abandoned factory.

"My hope is still to find a job, and to bring my wife and children to live with me," he said while seated outside his hut.

"It hasn't happened yet.

But I have hope.

My life will be better soon."
