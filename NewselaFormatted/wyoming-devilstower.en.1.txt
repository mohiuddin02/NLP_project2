But the vertical lines along the sides of the almost 390-meter-tall (nearly 1,300 feet) rock formation are not claw marks.

They are actually the edges of rough hexagonal-shaped columns of igneous — or volcanic — rock.

In shape, they are similar to other geological landmarks such as Ireland's Giant's Causeway or Devils Postpile in California.

The columns form as molten rock cools and contracts, cracking apart.

But how did the columns of Devils Tower form—below the ground or as part of a violent eruption?

A number of hypotheses for the 49-million-year-old rock formation have been suggested over the years.

The most popular ones today are that Devils Tower was born as a half dome of magma — molten rock — squeezed between underground layers of rock or deep inside a volcano.

Prokop Závada, a geologist at The Czech Academy of Sciences, and three other researchers became interested in this mystery through another butte in the Czech Republic, named Boren.

A butte is an isolated rock formation with straight sides and a flat top.

Boren shares some similarities with Devils Tower, although it is more rounded and covered with trees.

The researchers concluded that Boren was created by a sudden type of volcano called a maar-diatreme.

This kind of volcano blasts a crater through the surface of the Earth when molten rock underground encounters groundwater.

After the blast, the researchers believe, a flat dome of lava filled the crater, acting like a plug.

Erosion ate away at the edges of that dome until only the innermost portion remained, standing as an isolated butte.

Given Devils Tower's similarities to Boren, Závada and his team were curious to see if the Wyoming butte was formed in the same way.

There were two main characteristics the researchers used to hone in on the origins of Devils Tower.

The first was the shape of its distinctive columns and the second was the alignment of magnetic minerals within them.

The National Park Service let the researchers collect one new rock sample from Devils Tower to analyze its magnetic properties.

Zavada and his team discovered that near the base of Devils Tower, tiny, needle-shaped magnetic minerals within the rock are generally almost vertical, the direction the magma flowed before it solidified.

Closer to the top of the formation, however, those minerals turn horizontal.

With that information in hand, the researchers turned to digital and physical models.

For a physical model, they squeezed soft plaster upward through an upside-down cone full of sediment until it formed a mound on the surface.

This resembled the eruption of lava following the explosive phase of a maar-diatreme volcano.

Because they mixed in some magnetic particles as well, they were able to measure which way these particles faced just as they had done at Devils Tower.

They also made a computer simulation of cooling igneous rock.

The simulation allowed the researchers to use different scenarios to compare columns created during the tower's formation as it cooled.

The vertical columns of Devils Tower matched the pattern the researchers expected if it were indeed the plug of volcanic rock.

In the plaster models, the direction of the magnetic particles also matched the direction of the minerals from Devils Tower.

They pointed closer to vertical around the base and horizontal near the top.

In a paper published in Geosphere, Závada and his team concluded that Devils Tower was caused by an underground volcano like Boren in the Czech Republic.

Western Washington University's Bernard Housen, who was not involved in the study, called the work "interesting and certainly very plausible."

However, he was not convinced it ruled out the other possibilities.

He said there just wasn't enough data from Devils Tower itself, given that so few samples of the national monument have been allowed.

"So, it is likely that the origin of Devils Tower will remain uncertain in part due to the protections" that ensure it is preserved, he said.

It might be possible to study the similar, if less spectacular, buttes in the vicinity of Devils Tower, however.

They were likely formed in the same way — with or without the help of giant bears.
