There are people who have been living in Alaska for many, many years.

They were living there long before the United States began.

They are called Native Alaskans.

Native Alaskans eat walrus.

Walrus are large sea animals.

Only Native Alaskans are allowed to hunt walrus.

Eating walrus is part of their way of life.

These days, walrus are hard to find.

There are not as many in Alaska anymore.

Global warming has made many walrus swim away.

The ice they like is melting.

Global warming means that our planet is getting hotter.

If there are no walrus to eat, Native Alaskans will not have enough food.

Some people are going hungry.

Anna Oxereok is a Native Alaskan.

She grew up eating walrus in her village.

Today, she does not eat much walrus.

Anna has one piece of walrus in her freezer.

She is waiting to eat it.

"I have to save it for something special," she says.

Her brother caught two walrus this spring.

He shared them with their village.

Two walrus for 150 people was not very much.

Anna was glad she got some.

Walrus are moving around more.

Global warming has forced them to.

In Alaska, there is ice in the sea.

Walrus like to rest on the ice.

Now it is getting warmer in Alaska.

More ice has turned to water.

Some walrus have moved.

They went to where there is still ice.

Now there are fewer walrus for Native Alaskans to hunt.

Without walrus to eat, there has been less meat.

Native Alaskans do not buy much food in stores.

They do not have enough money.

They must find their own food.

Finding enough food has been hard without walrus.

Anna is not thinking about moving.

Moving would mean leaving everything she knows.

Anna will stay.

She hopes that enough walrus stay, too.
