Belen Sisa, who came to the United States from Argentina 15 years ago, says it is time to stop using "inhumane" language to describe the many immigrants who call America home.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/alien-immigrationlanguage-5863a18b.png" /> Sisa, 21, and a resident of Gilbert, Arizona, objects to two terms used to describe immigrants and says "alien" and "illegal alien" should not be used.

She may soon get her wish.

A new congressional bill suggests that these terms should be stricken from use by any government agency.

If Congress votes to pass the bill — and President Barack Obama signs it — it would become law.

The phrases "alien" and "illegal alien" would be replaced with "foreign national" and "undocumented foreign national."

The word "alien" refers to people — often workers or students — who live in a country but do not have citizenship there.

"Alien" also means a creature from another planet.

Sisa said that the terms make her feel as if "I'm not a human in the eyes of other people and the eyes of the federal government."

She said removing what she sees as offensive language would be a step toward showing more respect to immigrants.

Representative Joaquin Castro, a Democrat from Texas, introduced the bill, which is called the Correcting Hurtful and Alienating Names in Government Expression (CHANGE) Act, on Oct. 21.

It has already attracted 87 Democratic co-sponsors in the House of Representatives and the support of numerous advocacy groups.

"Terms like 'illegal alien' are used by those who would rather marginalize and dehumanize undocumented people than find an answer to our broken immigration system," said Roger Rocha Jr., president of the League of United Latin American Citizens, one of the largest organizations for Hispanics in the United States.

Rocha said the bill represents progress toward serious immigration reform.

He noted that 70 percent of Americans support improving immigration laws.

This is not the first time lawmakers have moved to strike offensive language from the law.

Castro's office pointed to Rosa's Law, a 2010 measure that replaced all references to "mental retardation" in federal law with "intellectual disability."

Two years later, Congress passed the 21st Century Language Act, mandating the removal of references to the word "lunatic" from certain areas within U.S. law.

Both bills passed with almost unanimous support in Congress.

Democratic Representative Ruben Gallego of Arizona, a co-sponsor of the CHANGE Act, said he hopes to see the same support for this bill because it does not call for any changes to immigration law.

Gallego said that changing the word "alien" is an important part of an effort to improve the system of due process for immigrants.

The term has become insulting, Gallego said.

"It unduly harms the person who is trying to go through due process."

Democratic Representative Raul Grijalva of Arizona also co-sponsored the bill.

He said that the issues of immigration and civil rights are closely connected.

"You could be a fifth-generation Latino," he said, and yet the language and the racism are demeaning.

"It makes you less than a full American," he said.

Sisa said the word has affected her beyond just federal law.

When applying for a job, she said, an interviewer told her she is "technically … an alien" and asked if she was even allowed to apply for the job.

She said she understands why undocumented people must be characterized differently from citizens, but her hope is that the bill encourages the government to use language that is more respectful and sympathetic.

"Symbolically, it would mean that we're taking a step forward and we're accepting immigrants," Sisa said of the proposed change.

That is the message Castro promotes with the act.

"Words matter," he said, especially when they are about an "issue as contentious as immigration."
