Their goal is to build a brand new kind of toilet.

This might make you laugh.

Don't.

It's not funny.

Water made dirty by poop can cause deadly diseases in poor countries.

Many people there don't have toilets like we do.

For example, the United Nations says that more than 600 million people in India don't use toilets.

They don't use pits, called latrines, either.

They just go on the ground.

And that's just one country.

Big improvements have occurred in the past 20 years.

But, about 1 billion people worldwide still go out in the open.

Another 700 million use dirty types of bathrooms.

Some people use "hanging latrines" that dump directly into streams.

Or they use buckets that are emptied in the streets.

When the waste is disposed in that way, it can get into water.

That makes it dirty.

If people drink that water it can cause diarrhea.

It causes people to go to the bathroom many times a day.

If it goes on too long, the body loses the water and salts it needs to survive.

Diarrhea kills as many as 1.5 million people each year.

Most of those deaths are from water made dirty by human waste.

Most of the victims are under 5 years old.

Can Kohler help?

The company is mostly known for producing expensive sinks and faucets.

It's not known for making toilets for the world's poor.

But Kohler is one the world's biggest makers of plumbing products.

In 2011 the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation announced its "Reinvent the Toilet Challenge."

The foundation was started by Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates.

It gives the most money of any foundation.

That made Kohler take notice.

It's been a long time since the toilet changed much.

The modern flush toilet isn't much different than the one invented in the 1500s by Sir John Harington.

He was an English writer.

He installed one of his toilets in a palace for Queen Elizabeth I.

The toilet was improved over the next couple hundred years.

It has worked pretty well.

It helps lower disease â€” when it's well-connected.

It needs to be attached to a system to treat the waste it swirls away.

In much of the world, there are no pipes or waste treatment plants.

They cost too much to build for poor countries.

"That's very, very expensive," said Doulaye Kone, an engineer who grew up in a village in Africa's Ivory Coast.

He works at the Gates Foundation.

"It will work in very few (developing world) cities."

So the foundation asked for simple designs.

They don't need to be hooked up to water, sewer or electrical lines.

It gave money to eight universities.

One of those getting money was the California Institute of Technology (Caltech).

Caltech's plan was to develop a toilet and waste treatment system all in one.

The toilet would be powered by a solar panel.

It would get energy from the sun.

And it would store it for use at night.

Kohler contacted Caltech.

It gave Caltech parts for the first design.

The Caltech toilet went on to win the Gates challenge in 2012.

Caltech will test the toilet in India later this year.

One problem with the Caltech toilet is cost.

It will take $1,500 to $2,000 to build at first.

And it's complicated since it has a solar panel and battery But, the Gates Foundation is giving money to other toilet makers.

American Standard Brands also received money.

American Standard has taken a low-tech approach.

The company developed a plastic toilet pan with a trap door and water seal.

It's designed to close off the holes under latrines from the open air.

That stops flies from entering.

Last year, American Standard donated more than 500,000 of the devices to Bangladesh, the company said.

It now is working in Kenya to develop a simple device for areas that have little water.
